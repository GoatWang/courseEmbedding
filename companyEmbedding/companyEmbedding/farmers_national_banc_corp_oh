(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following presents a discussion and analysis of Farmers' financial condition and results of operations by its management. The review highlights the principal factors affecting earnings and the significant changes in balance sheet items for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014. Financial information for prior years is presented when appropriate. The objective of this financial review is to enhance the reader's understanding of the accompanying tables and charts, the consolidated financial statements, notes to financial statements and financial statistics appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Where applicable, this discussion also reflects management's insights of known events and trends that have or may reasonably be expected to have a material effect on Farmers' business, financial condition or results of operations.  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements  Discussions in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact (including statements that include terms such as "will," "may," "should," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," intend," and "plan") are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any forward-looking statement is not a guarantee of future performance, and actual future results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in Farmers' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Many of these factors are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict, and readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on those forward-looking statements. The following list, which is not intended to be an all-encompassing list of risks and uncertainties affecting the Company, summarizes several factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in these forward-looking statements:   general economic conditions in market areas where Farmers conducts business, which could materially impact credit quality trends;   business conditions in the banking industry;   the regulatory environment;   fluctuations in interest rates;   demand for loans in the market areas where Farmers conducts business;   rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards;   competitive factors, including increased competition with regional and national financial institutions;   new service and product offerings by competitors and price pressures; and   other similar items.  Other factors not currently anticipated may also materially and adversely affect Farmers' business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations. While the Company believes that the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are reasonable, the reader should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. In addition, these statements speak only as of the date made. Farmers does not undertake, and expressly disclaims, any obligation to update or alter any statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable law.  Results of Operations  Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.  The Company's net income totaled $20.6 million during 2016, compared to $8.1 million for 2015. On a per share basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.76 as compared to $0.36 diluted earnings per share for 2015. Excluding expenses related to acquisition activities, net income for 2016 would have been $21.0 million, or $0.78 per share, compared to $12.9 million or $0.57 per share in 2015. Common comparative ratios for results of operations include the return on average assets and return on average stockholders' equity. For 2016, the return on average equity was 9.72%, compared to 4.97% for 2015. The return on average assets was 1.07 % for 2016 and 0.54% for 2015. The annualized return on average assets and return on average equity excluding merger related expenses were 1.09% and 9.92% in 2016, compared to 0.87% and 7.95% in 2015, respectively.  The results for 2016 included $73 thousand in gains on sales of securities, compared to $94 thousand in 2015. In addition, 2016 results include $238 thousand in gains from the sale of land and buildings.  On June 1, 2016, the Bank completed the acquisition of Bowers, and merged Bowers with Insurance, the Bank's wholly-owned insurance agency subsidiary. Bowers will continue to operate out of its Cortland, Ohio location and will enhance the Company's current product lineup, and offer broader options of commercial, farm, home, and auto property/casualty insurance carriers to meet all the needs of all the Company's customers. The transaction involved both cash and 123,280 shares of stock totaling $3.2 million, including up to $1.2 million of future payments, contingent upon Bowers meeting performance targets. Goodwill of $1.8 million, which is recorded on the balance sheet, arising from the acquisition consisted largely of synergies and the cost savings resulting from the combining of the companies. The goodwill was determined not to be deductible for income tax purposes. The fair value of other intangible assets of $1.6 million is related to client relationships, company name and noncompetition agreements.  On June 19, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding stock of National Bancshares Corporation ("NBOH"), the parent company of First National Bank of Orrville ("First National Bank"). The transaction involved both cash and 7,262,955 shares of stock totaling $74.8 million. First National Bank branches became branches of Farmers Bank. Pursuant to the Agreement, each shareholder of NBOH received either $32.15 per share in cash or 4.034 shares of Farmers' common stock, subject to an overall limitation of 80% of the shares of NBOH being exchanged for stock and 20% for cash.  On October 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Tri-State 1st Banc, Inc. ("Tri-State"), the parent company of 1st National Community Bank ("FNCB"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, common shareholders of Tri-State were entitled to receive 1.747 shares of Farmers' common stock, or $14.20 in cash, for each common share, without par value, of Tri-State (the "Tri-State Common Shares"), subject to proration provisions specified in the Merger Agreement that provide for a targeted aggregate split of total consideration consisting of 75% Company Common Shares and 25% cash. Preferred shareholders of Tri-State received $13.60 in cash for each share of Series A Preferred Stock, without par value, of Tri-State. Total consideration actually paid was in the form of $3.6 million in cash and $10.7 million worth of the Company's stock on October 1, 2015.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income, the principal source of the Company's earnings, represents the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. For 2016, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $18.8 million, or 36.3%, from 2015. Interest-earning assets averaged $1.761 billion during 2016, increasing $398.6 million compared to 2015. The Company's interest-bearing liabilities increased 27.8% from $1.057 billion in 2015 to $1.351 billion in 2016. The two previously mentioned acquisitions increased interest-earning assets by $647.5 million and interest-bearing liabilities by $605.5 million at their respective completion dates.  The Company finances its earning assets with a combination of interest-bearing and interest-free funds. The interest-bearing funds are composed of deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Interest paid for the use of these funds is the second factor in the net interest income equation. Interest-free funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders' equity, require no interest expense and, therefore, contribute significantly to net interest income.  The profit margin, or spread, on invested funds is a key performance measure. The Company monitors two key performance indicators - net interest spread and net interest margin. The net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest spread in 2016 was 3.94%, increasing from 3.72% in 2015. The net interest margin represents the overall profit margin - net interest income as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. This performance indicator gives effect to interest earned for all investable funds including the substantial volume of interest-free funds. For 2016, the net interest margin, measured on a fully taxable equivalent basis, increased to 4.01%, compared to 3.81% in 2015. The net interest margin, excluding the impact of amortization and accretion from the current year acquisitions, improved 19 basis points to 3.95% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The accretion added $98 thousand per month during 2016 and will continue over the next several years.  The increase in net interest margin is largely a result of interest bearing liabilities repricing at lower rates and the shifting of assets from investment securities to higher interest income rates of loans. As long term time deposits mature they are being renewed at lesser rates or moving to more liquid accounts at lower interest rates. Total taxable equivalent interest income was $75.1 million for 2016, which is $19.1 million more than the $56.0 million reported in 2015. In comparing the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, yields on earning assets increased 15 basis points while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased 7 basis points. Average loans increased $388.9 million, or 40.7%, in 2016, and the loan yield remained unchanged at 4.74%. Tax equated income from securities, federal funds and other increased $591 thousand, or 5.5%, in 2016. Farmers saw its yields on these assets increase slightly from 2.64% in 2015 to 2.72% in 2016 and the average balance of investment securities and federal funds sold also increased from $407.2 million in 2015 to $416.8 million in 2016.  Total interest expense amounted to $4.4 million for 2016, a 7.0% increase from $4.1 million reported in 2015. The increase in 2016 is the result of a $204.9 million increase in interest-bearing deposits and an $89.0 million increase in other borrowings. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 0.39% in 2015 to 0.32% in 2016.  Management will continue to evaluate future changes in interest rates and the shape of the treasury yield curve so that assets and liabilities may be priced accordingly to minimize the impact on the net interest margin.  Noninterest Income  Total noninterest income increased by $4.9 million in 2016. The increase in noninterest income is due to several factors. Gains on the sale of mortgage loans increased from $1.1 million to $2.8 million, representing an increase of $1.7 million. Insurance agency commissions also increased to $1.6 million compared to $569 thousand in 2015 and service charges on deposit accounts increased from $3.3 million in 2015 to $4.0 million in 2016, reflecting the size of the company of after the two bank acquisitions. Debit card interchange fees also increased $780 thousand or 41.5%. Other operating income also increased $599 thousand, primarily as a result of the positive impact from account level transaction volumes from the merger related growth. The Bank and Company expect these amounts to increase during 2017 as management continues to focus on growing the various sources of noninterest income.  Noninterest Expenses  Noninterest expense for 2016 was $59.5 million, compared to $54.0 million in 2015, representing an increase of $5.5 million, or 10.1%. Most of the increase was from salaries and employee benefits, which increased $5.3 million or 19.8%, mainly due to an increase in the number of employees resulting from the mergers. The Company's full time equivalent employees ("FTE") increased by 8.5% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Occupancy and equipment costs also increased $1.2 million due to the additional banking locations resulting from the mergers. Excluding expenses related to acquisition activities, noninterest expenses measured as a percentage of average assets decreased from 3.21% in 2015 to 3.06% in 2016.  The Company's tax equivalent efficiency ratio for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 was 61.59%, compared to 75.26% for the same period in 2015. Excluding expenses related to acquisition activities, the efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 improved to 60.99% compared to 66.2% in 2015. The main factors leading to the improvement in the efficiency ratio was the increase in net interest income and noninterest income, along with the stabilized level of noninterest expenses relative to average assets as explained in the preceding paragraph. The efficiency ratio is calculated as follows:  Income Taxes  Income tax expense totaled $7.5 million for 2016 and $2.5 million in 2015. Income taxes are computed using the appropriate effective tax rates for each period. The increase in the current year tax expense is a result of a 165% increase in income before income taxes, from $10.55 million in 2015 to $28 million in 2016. The effective tax rates are less than the statutory tax rate primarily due to nontaxable interest and dividend income. The effective income tax rate was 26.7% for 2016 and 23.7% for 2015. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the effective tax rate.  Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  The Company's net income totaled $8.1 million during 2015, compared to $9.0 million for 2014. On a per share basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.36 as compared to $0.48 diluted earnings per share for 2014. Excluding expenses related to acquisition activities, net income for 2015 would have been $12.9 million, or $0.57 per share. Common comparative ratios for results of operations include the return on average assets and return on average stockholders' equity. For 2015, the return on average equity was 4.97%, compared to 7.45% for 2014. The return on average assets was 0.54% for 2015 and 0.79% for 2014. Excluding expenses related to acquisition activities, the return on average assets and return on average stockholders' equity were 0.87% and 7.95%, respectively.  The results for 2015 included $94 thousand in gains on sales of securities, compared to $457 thousand in 2014.  Net Interest Income  For 2015, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $13.7 million, or 36.0%, from 2014. Interest-earning assets averaged $1.363 billion during 2015, increasing $301.2 million compared to 2014. The Company's interest-bearing liabilities increased 24.8% from $847.3 million in 2014 to $1.057 billion in 2015. The NBOH and Tri-State acquisitions increased interest-earning assets by $647.5 million and interest-bearing liabilities by $605.5 million at their respective completion dates.  Total taxable equivalent interest income was $51.9 million for 2015, which is $13.7 million more than the $38.1 million reported in 2014. In comparing the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014, yields on earning assets increased 6 basis points while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased similarly at 19 basis points. Average loans increased $324.4 million, or 51.41%, in 2015, however the yields decreased from 4.97% in 2014 to 4.74% in 2015. Tax equated income from securities, federal funds and other decreased $601 thousand, or 5.30%, in 2015. Even though tax equated income decreased, Farmers saw its yields on these assets increase slightly from 2.63% in 2014 to 2.64% in 2015. The average balance of investment securities and federal funds sold decreased from $430.4 million in 2014 to $407.2 million in 2015.  Total interest expense amounted to $4.1 million for 2015, a 10.7% decrease from $4.6 million reported in 2014. The decrease in 2015 is the result of lower rates of interest paid on interest-bearing deposits and repurchase agreements. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 0.54% in 2014 to 0.39% in 2015.  Noninterest Income  Total noninterest income increased by $3 million in 2015. The increase in noninterest income is due to several factors. Gains on the sale of mortgage loans increased from $358 thousand to $1.1 million, representing an increase of $743 thousand. Retirement plan consulting fees also increased to $2.1 million compared to $1.8 million in 2014 and service charges on deposit accounts increased from $2.6 million in 2014 to $3.3 million in 2015, reflecting the size of the company of after the two acquisitions. Investment commissions increased $146 thousand or 14%, as management continues to focus on diversifying revenue sources to decrease the reliance on net interest income as the main driver of revenue. Other operating income also increased $1 million, primarily as a result of the positive impact from account level transaction volumes from the merger related growth. Included in the increase in other operating income was debit card interchange income, which increased $618 thousand, and ATM fee income, which increased $74 thousand.  Noninterest Expenses  Noninterest expense for 2015 was $54.0 million, compared to $38.2 million in 2014, representing an increase of $15.8 million, or 41.5%. Most of the increase was from merger related costs, which were $6.4 million in 2015, compared to none in 2014. Salaries and employee benefits also increased $5.8 million, mainly due to an increase in the number of employees resulting from the mergers. The Company's full time equivalent employees ("FTE") increased by 105 from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Occupancy and equipment costs also increased $947 thousand due to the additional eighteen banking locations resulting from the mergers. Excluding expenses related to acquisition activities, noninterest expenses measured as a percentage of average assets decreased from 3.34% in 2014 to 3.21% in 2015.  The Company's tax equivalent efficiency ratio for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015 was 75.26%, compared to 70.24% for the same period in 2014. Excluding expenses related to acquisition activities, the efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 improved to 66.2%. The main factors leading to the improvement in the efficiency ratio was the increase in net interest income and noninterest income, along with the stabilized level of noninterest expenses relative to average assets as explained in the preceding paragraph. The efficiency ratio is calculated as follows: non-interest expense divided by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income, excluding security gains and losses and intangible amortization. This ratio is a  measure of the expense incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. Management will continue to closely monitor and keep the increases in other expenses to a minimum.  Income Taxes  Income tax expense totaled $2.5 million for 2015 and $2.6 million in 2014. The small decrease in the current year tax expense can be mainly attributed to the $1.0 million decrease in income before taxes. The effective tax rates are less than the statutory tax rate primarily due to nontaxable interest and dividend income. The effective income tax rate was 23.7% for 2015 and 22.7% for 2014.  Liquidity  Farmers maintains, in the opinion of management, liquidity sufficient to satisfy depositors' requirements and meet the credit needs of customers. The Company depends on its ability to maintain its market share of deposits as well as acquiring new funds. The Company's ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends in large measure on its profitability, capitalization and overall financial condition.  Principal sources of liquidity include assets considered relatively liquid, such as short-term investment securities, federal funds sold and cash and due from banks.  Along with its liquid assets, Farmers has additional sources of liquidity available which help to insure that adequate funds are available as needed. These other sources include, but are not limited to, loan repayments, the ability to obtain deposits through the adjustment of interest rates and the purchasing of federal funds and borrowings on approved lines of credit at two major domestic banks. At December 31, 2016, Farmers had not borrowed against these lines of credit. Management feels that its liquidity position is more than adequate and will continue to monitor the position on a monthly basis. The Company also has additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB, as well as access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window, which provides an additional source of funds. The Company views its membership in the FHLB as a solid source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank is eligible to borrow an additional $144 million from the FHLB under various fixed rate and variable rate credit facilities. Advances outstanding from the FHLB at December 31, 2016 amounted to $132.9 million.  Farmers' primary investing activities are originating loans and purchasing securities. During 2016, net cash used by investing activities amounted to $115.2 million, compared to $23.1 million used in 2015. Net increases in loans were $133.2 million in 2016, compared to $139.7 million in 2015. The cash used by lending activities during 2016 can be attributed to the activity in the commercial real estate, residential real estate, agricultural and consumer loan portfolios. Purchases of securities available for sale were $52.6 million in 2016, compared to $72.7 million in 2015, and proceeds from maturities and sales of securities available for sale were $71.4 million in 2016, compared to $165.6 million in 2015. Net cash of $29.7 million was received as a result of the acquisitions of NBOH and Tri-State in 2015.  Farmers' primary financing activities are obtaining deposits, repurchase agreements and other borrowings. Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $76.7 million for 2016, compared to $45.4 million in 2015. The majority of this increase can be attributed to the net change in deposits. Deposits increased $115.7 million in 2016, compared to a $44.7 million decrease in 2015. Short-term borrowings decreased $27.4 million during 2016, compared to a $91.2 million increase during 2015.

Loans grew 10% organically during the past twelve months. The organic increase in loans is a direct result of Farmers' focus on loan growth utilizing a talented lending and credit team, while adhering to a sound underwriting discipline. Most of the increase in loans has occurred in the commercial real estate, agricultural, residential real estate and consumer loan portfolios. Loans comprised 76.3% of the Bank's average earning assets in 2016, compared to 70.1% in 2015. The product mix in the loan portfolio includes commercial loans comprising 14.3%, residential real estate loans 30.1%, commercial real estate loans 31.2%, consumer loans 15.3% and agricultural loans 9.1% at December 31, 2016, compared with 15.4%, 30.4%, 31.5%, 14.3% and 9.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2015.  Loans contributed 84.9% of total taxable equivalent interest income in 2016 and 80.8% in 2015. Loan yields were 4.74% in 2015, 48 basis points greater than the average rate for total earning assets. Management recognizes that while the loan portfolio holds some of the Bank's' highest yielding assets, it is inherently the most risky portfolio. Accordingly, management attempts to balance credit risk versus return with conservative credit standards. Management has developed and maintains comprehensive underwriting guidelines and a loan review function that monitors credits during and after the approval process. To minimize risks associated with changes in the borrower's future repayment capacity, the Bank generally requires scheduled periodic principal and interest payments on all types of loans and normally requires collateral. Commercial loans at December 31, 2016 increased 2.5% from year-end 2015 with outstanding balances of . . .  Mar 07, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

	April 21, 2017


	Fellow
	Shareholders,


	Life and experience teaches us the value of a good start. Whether its the beginning of a new day, a new business relationship or a
	new year, a good start provides a foundation of confidence for how the rest of the day, relationship or year will proceed.


	In that light, I am pleased to
	share with you the results of the first quarter of 2017, a quarter that marks a new high watermark for your companys total assets as well as a continuation of the steady growth, strength and progress of your bank.



	Returning Value to Shareholders



	Farmers has a history of
	creating and returning value to shareholders. I am pleased to announce that Farmers increased its cash dividend from $0.04 to $0.05 during the first quarter, representing a 25% increase from the 2016 first quarter payment. This is the second
	increase to Farmers dividend in two years reflecting the companys strong financial results, the successful integrations of three acquisitions, and the Boards desire to return capital to our shareholders.



	Asset Milestone



	In six short years, we have doubled the
	asset size of our bank. Since crossing $1.0 billion in assets in 2011, we have stayed focused on our strategic growth plan which has paved the way for the company to reach over $2.0 billion in assets at the end of the 2017 first quarter. This growth
	enhances profitability by creating significant economies of scale and improved operational efficiencies. As a larger institution, our competitiveness with larger banks increases and we can better serve our local businesses by offering customers
	higher lending limits and expanded financial products, while attracting proven, knowledgeable, and motivated associates. While our size increases, we remain committed to offering our customers personalized, local, and value-oriented financial
	services.



	Strong results



	Farmers could not
	successfully create value for shareholders, or increase the asset size of our bank, if it was not for our growth-oriented business plan, steadfast financial model, and community-focused corporate culture. Our 2017 first-quarter financial results
	demonstrate how these corporate values are driving Farmers success and increasing profitability. The companys Return on Average Assets increased to 1.17%, compared to 1.03% for the same period a year ago, while our Return on Average
	Tangible Equity increased to 13.54%, compared to 11.83% a year ago. Farmers efficiency ratio improved to 58.79%, compared to 62.65% one year ago, and diluted earnings per share has increased 5% from $0.20, to $0.21 during the 2017 first
	quarter.

	Monitor Bank Acquisition



	On March 13, 2017, Farmers National Banc Corp. and Monitor Bancorp, Inc., the holding company for Monitor Bank, announced they entered into a merger
	agreement. Monitor Bank consists of one branch located in Big Prairie, Ohio and has $43 million in assets. In addition, this transaction will serve as an entrance into the attractive Holmes County market for Farmers. Monitor has an excellent core
	deposit base and has been a solid earner with strong asset quality. This transaction helps Farmers continue to grow its market share, balance sheet and earnings. We are excited to announce our fourth acquisition in the past two years, which further
	enhances Farmers brand and delivers long-term value for our shareholders.


	Farmers expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share,
	excluding one-time merger costs, beginning in the first full year of combined operations, and expects it to be immediately accretive to tangible book value per share with no tangible book value dilution. After closing the transaction it is expected
	that Farmers National Bank will exceed well-capitalized thresholds under all regulatory definitions. Farmers anticipates completing the deal in July, 2017.


	Benjamin Franklin once stated, Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning. An
	accomplished businessman as well as a founding father and inventor, Benjamin Franklin knew the value of the steady upward trajectory, of perpetually accomplishing something more than the day before. Your company concurs with Mr. Franklins
	ideal, and accepts it as our standard and aim.


	Very truly yours,
