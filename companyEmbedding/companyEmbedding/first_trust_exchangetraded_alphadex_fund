First Trust Advisors Announces The Release Of Thirteen New ETF Products Into Its AlphaDEX® Family Of Funds.






Business Wire




Apr 14, 2011 4:41 PM EDT













 


















































  First Trust Advisors L.P. (“First Trust”) today announced the anticipated launch of thirteen new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into its current line of sixteen AlphaDEX ® funds. The thirteen new ETFs are anticipated to begin trading on April 19 on the NYSE Arca. Nine of the funds are in the international arena and the other four round out the family with small- and mid- cap domestic funds.  AlphaDEX  ®   InternationalFPA First Trust Asia Pacific Ex-Japan AlphaDEX ® FundFEP First Trust Europe AlphaDEX ® FundFLN First Trust Latin America AlphaDEX ® FundFBZ First Trust Brazil AlphaDEX ® FundFCA First Trust China AlphaDEX ® FundFJP First Trust Japan AlphaDEX ® FundFKO First Trust South Korea AlphaDEX ® FundFDT First Trust Developed Markets Ex-US AlphaDEX ® FundFEM First Trust Emerging Markets AlphaDEX ® Fund  AlphaDEX  ®   DomesticFNY First Trust Mid Cap Growth AlphaDEX ® FundFNK First Trust Mid Cap Value AlphaDEX ® FundFYC First Trust Small Cap Growth AlphaDEX ® FundFYT First Trust Small Cap Value AlphaDEX ® Fund  “We are excited to add these thirteen new funds to the AlphaDEX ® family of ETFs, nearly doubling the existing line-up. The nine funds comprising the AlphaDEX ® International family of funds consists of a diverse range of broad, regional and single country funds. We believe the positive effects of globalization are going to continue for years to come and investors may benefit from a globally diversified investment portfolio, particularly in the emerging markets where GDP growth for 2011 is projected to be 6.4% compared to 2.2% for advanced economies, according to the International Monetary Fund.” said Dan Waldron, Senior Vice President, Exchange-Traded Funds Strategist of First Trust.   About AlphaDEX    ®     ETF product line   The AlphaDEX ® ETF product line was initially launched in May of 2007. It currently contains 16 funds with over $2.8 billion in assets under management. The entire First Trust family of ETFs has over $7.4 billion in assets.  The AlphaDEX ® funds are designed to track the performance of a group of custom “enhanced” indexes which employ the proprietary, rules-based AlphaDEX ® fundamental stock selection methodology. The AlphaDEX ® methodology is relatively simple and uses only three growth factors and three value factors.  The index each AlphaDEX ® fund tracks is designed to generate Alpha and provide a higher return than a traditional Beta index.  A complete analysis of performance of the AlphaDEX ® funds is available at: http://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=eddd1a72-5f2e-48e9-b85d-953e3cf9cf5b   About First Trust Advisors L.P.

FBZ Fund Description
The First Trust Brazil AlphaDex fund tracks an index weighted in tiers and selected based on a proprietary methodology.
  
FBZ FactSet Analytics Insight
FBZ does not attempt to provide neutral exposure to Brazil, instead trying to select firms best positioned to outperform the market. This gives it a significant small- and midcap tilt, makes it a poor Fit to our benchmark, and a choice only for those investors willing to assume the increased risks of its portfolio. FBZ more than doubles the utilities exposure of the market (13% vs. 6%) while giving consumer non-cyclicals (the second largest weighting in our benchmark) a 7% haircut. These sector bets drive a slightly increased beta. Even if this skewed portfolio is your cup of tea (although we see no significant alpha), before diving in, be aware that the fund is highly priced (80 bps expense ratio) and its meager asset tally makes it a nightmare to trade.

Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies which provide a variety of investment services, including asset management and financial advisory services, with collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $107 billion as of May 31, 2017 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts.You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a Fund before investing. Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing.Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Principal Risk Factors: A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings.An Index ETF seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index. You should anticipate that the value of an Index Fund's shares will decline, more or less, in correlation with any decline in the value of the index. An Index Fund's return may not match the return of the index. Unlike a Fund, the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a Fund.Investors buying or selling Fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Investors who sell Fund shares may receive less than the share's net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the Fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the Fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may trade at a discount to the Fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.One of the principal risks of investing in a Fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a Fund, Fund shares or securities in general may fall in value.An actively managed ETF is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing such a Fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers, management teams, advisor or sub-advisor, will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result.A Fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks, including limited diversification. An investment in a Fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a Fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.Certain Funds may invest in small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.An investment in a Fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. A Fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.Read MoreInvestments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and/or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations.A Fund that invests in the European region is subject to certain risks because member states in the European Union no longer control their own monetary policies, money supply and official interest rates for the Euro. Rather, such control is exercised by the European Central Bank.Certain securities held by certain of the Funds are subject to credit risk, call risk, income risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, and zero coupon risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk is heightened for floating-rate loans and high-yield securities. Call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by a Fund, performance could be adversely impacted. Income risk is the risk that income from a Fund's fixed-income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed-income securities in a Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in a decline in a Fund's income. Zero coupon risk is the risk that zero coupon bonds may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall.Senior floating-rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated. As a result, the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high-yield fixed income instruments. High-yield securities, or "junk" bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, may be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations, and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. The market for high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.Income from municipal bonds held by a Fund could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer. Income from municipal bonds held by a Fund may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax.Convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and, as a result, are exposed to certain additional risks. The values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments, each with its own market value. A Fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument. Synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives.Exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees. The value of an ETN may be influenced by various factors.Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate operating companies (REOCs) are subject to certain risks, including changes in the real estate market, vacancy rates and competition, volatile interest rates and economic recession.Master limited partnerships (MLPs) are subject to certain risks, including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics, energy conservation, taxes, price controls, and other regulatory policies of various governments. In addition, there is the risk that an MLP could be taxed as a corporation, resulting in decreased returns from such MLP.The use of futures, options, and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when a Fund's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a Fund's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by a Fund.The stocks of companies that have recently conducted an initial public offering have exhibited above-average price appreciation in connection with the initial public offering prior to inclusion in a Fund, which may not continue, and these investments may be subject to additional risks, price volatility and speculative trading.A Fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, an investment in a Fund may be less tax-efficient than an investment in an exchange-traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in-kind securities.Commodity futures contracts traded on non-U.S. exchanges or with non-U.S. counterparties present risks because they may not be subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts.A Fund's investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements.Alternative investments may employ complex strategies, have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors.Certain Funds may invest in other investment companies, including closed-end funds (CEFs), ETFs and affiliated ETFs, which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a Fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds.A Fund may invest in U.S. government obligations. U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the "full faith and credit" of the U.S. government. Securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.Short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, a Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy.Certain Funds may invest in distressed securities, and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value. Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the Fund or at prices approximately the value at which the Fund is carrying the securities on its books.Because the shares of CEFs cannot be redeemed upon demand, shares of many CEFs will trade on exchanges at market prices rather than net asset value, which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). There can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any CEF purchased by a Fund will ever decrease or that when a Fund seeks to sell shares of a CEF, it can receive the NAV for those shares. A Fund may also be exposed to higher volatility in the market due to indirect use of leverage through its investment in CEFs. CEFs may issue senior securities in an attempt to enhance returns.Certain Funds are classified as "non-diversified" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.Certain Funds have fewer assets than larger, more established funds, and like other relatively new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact such Funds' market exposure for limited periods of time."AlphaDEX®" is a registered trademark of First Trust Portfolios L.P.
