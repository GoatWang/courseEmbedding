"In the early 1980s, we decided to switch to BNB because of the great service and friendly professionals who we speak with on a daily basis."
Richard King
Fresh Egg Farm Stand, President 
	



Bridgehampton National Bank
About Us
Many Success Stories. One Bank.
Bridgehampton National Bank (BNB) ranks among the Top 3 community banks in New York, according to American Banker. Headquartered in Suffolk County, New York, BNB has been meeting the needs of Long Island businesses and families since 1910. Now more than 100 years later, our commitment to the tenets of community banking remain as strong as ever: We develop long-term relationships with local customers, offering banking knowledge and an understanding of the local marketplace while taking an active role in making the towns and villages we serve better places to live and work.
Our professional teams of experienced local bankers offer flexible programs designed to help customers meet their business and personal financial needs. All lending and banking decisions are made right here on Long Island.
This local market focus is backed by a full range of products and services, including effective technologies like online banking and bill pay, remote deposit capture and lockbox as well as the traditional menu of deposit and loan products. We also offer title insurance through Bridge Abstract and investment direction through Bridge Investment Services. Whether it's a business loan or home closing, BNB has an outstanding reputation for personal service, access to decision-makers and community involvement and investment.

Bridge Bancorp Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 3.05% Yield (BDGE)

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
