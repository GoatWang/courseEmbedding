Kim Metcalf-Kupres, chief marketing officer at Johnson Controls, in Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum.



I’VE traveled most of my career, but until about five years ago, most of my business trips were domestic. I’m starting my 20th year with Johnson Controls, and as its chief marketing officer now, most of my trips are international. Whether I like flying is debatable. It’s probably fairer to say that I’ve gotten used to flying. At one time, I was a horrible “white-knuckle” flier, and now I’m just kind of numb to it. Takeoffs and landings don’t worry me as much anymore, and I don’t even think twice about turbulence.Despite flying so much, I don’t seem to have misfortune when traveling for work. Actually, I may prefer airline turbulence to driving with my husband. On a trip to Maui for a mechanical contractors convention, I had the opportunity to bring my family along so they could experience Hawaii for the first time. We arrived during a not-so-pleasant rainy season, but still decided to make the best of our time and explore.My husband was behind the wheel of our rental car and we drove up a hillside to see a volcano. We were ducking in and out of oncoming traffic, and he eventually pulled over on the edge of a cliff. Unfortunately, one of the car’s rear tires was partly hanging off the edge of that cliff. I love my husband dearly, but there was really no polite way to tell him, “Dear, we are hanging off a cliff.” Everything is relative, and considering that my husband nearly drove us off a cliff, I much prefer the plane.I’m very polite to seatmates, but not much of a talker. But when I was flying back to Chicago from China, a gentleman struck up a conversation with me. He was intrigued that a woman, who happened to be me, was reading technical industry trade publications on cars and batteries. We started talking, and I explained that my interest in this literature stemmed from my job. Being polite, I asked him what he did for a living. He was a physicist and somehow we landed on a subject that actually piqued my interest — dark matter. As the daughter of a physics and chemistry teacher, dark matter is something I’d always been interested in and didn’t quite understand. This gentleman didn’t help me understand it any better.After about 90 minutes of conversation, with me saying very little, I had heard more about dark matter than I’d anticipated. It still made no sense. I thought I was asking decent questions, like “What is dark matter?” His answer: “We really don’t know.” It is kind of tough to come up with a question after that, but I tried something logical: If you don’t know what it is, how do you study it? His answer: “We don’t study it.” I must have looked very confused, because he clarified by saying that scientists study things around it. Every time I asked something, the answers became less satisfying. I’m a good listener and I like talking about technical subjects. I like learning new things, too. I was done with dark matter.He was very proud of his work, as I’m sure he should be. He was part of a team on some big government grant studying dark matter, though I’m not sure, because I didn’t understand the specifics. I eventually excused myself and hid out in the restroom for a while, which is something I have never done before. When I got back to my seat, I put in my earbuds for the rest of my 14-hour flight. I had learned enough about dark matter.
