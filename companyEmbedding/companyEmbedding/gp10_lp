The gp10-gp11 complex constitutes the six tail pins at the corners of the baseplate hexagon on the distal side. The stoichiometry of the subunits, gp10 and gp11, of this complex was determined in combination with sedimentation equilibrium, Edman degradation of the complex and sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). From the results of Edman degradation and SDS-PAGE, the molar ratio of gp10 and gp11 was approximately 1. On the other hand, the molecular weight of the purified gp10-gp11 complex was determined by sedimentation equilibrium to be 284 000±7000, which is in good agreement with the expected value of 269 840 if the stoichiometry is 3:3. Furthermore, comparison of the results in the presence and in the absence of reducing reagent, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), in SDS-PAGE revealed that two molecules of gp10 in the complex formed a disulfide bond, while the third gp10 molecule does not participate in the disulfide bond formation.KeywordsBacteriophageAssemblyStoichiometryAnalytical ultracentrifugationDisulfide bondLimited proteolysisChoose an option to locate/access this article:Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sign InorPurchaseorCheck for this article elsewhereRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)Copyright © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

10' High Pressure L.P. Gas Supply Line Hose
3/8" Female Swivel Flare Brass Fitting on each end
UL Listed Assembly












                    Product description
                    
                 


We prefer hose to copper supply line tubing because it won't corrode or develop stress/fatigue cracks and it is much easier to install. This UL listed hose is fully assembled and leak tested with solid brass fittings (3/8" female swivel flare each end), and high pressure, thermoplastic, LPG hose.

The gp11 polypeptide chain consists of 219 amino acid residues and the functionally active protein is a three-domain homotrimer. In this work, we have studied the role of gp11 N-terminal domain in the formation of a functionally active trimer. Deletion variants of gp11 and monoclonal antibodies recognizing the native conformation of gp11 trimer have been selected. Long deletions up to a complete removal of the N-terminal domain, containing 64 residues, do not affect the gp11 trimerization, but considerably change the protein structure and lead to the loss of its ability to incorporate into the baseplate. However, the deletion of the first 17 N-terminal residues results in functionally active protein that can complete the 11−-defective phage particles in in vitro complementation assay. This region of the polypeptide chain is probably essential for gp11-gp10 stable complex formation at the early stages of phage baseplate assembly in vivo. A study of the gp10 deletion variants suggests that the central domain of gp10 trimer is responsible for the interaction with gp11.Key wordsbacteriophage T4 baseplate gene product 11 gene product 10 deletion variants protein folding monoclonal antibodies __________Translated from Biokhimiya, Vol. 70, No. 10, 2005, pp. 1346–1354.Original Russian Text Copyright © 2005 by Vishnevskiy, Kurochkina, Sykilinda, Solov'eva, Shneider, Leiman, Mesyanzhinov.Originally published in Biochemistry (Moscow) On-Line Papers in Press, as Manuscript BM04-312, March 27, 2005.PreviewUnable to display preview. Download preview PDF.Unable to display preview. Download preview PDF.REFERENCES1.Kostyuchenko, V.

Abstract
Bacteriophage T4 late gene product 11 (gp11), the three-dimensional structure of which has been solved by us to 2.0 resolution, is a part of the virus' baseplate. The gp11 polypeptide chain consists of 219 amino acid residues and the functionally active protein is a three-domain homotrimer. In this work, we have studied the role of gp11 N-terminal domain in the formation of a functionally active trimer. Deletion variants of gp11 and monoclonal antibodies recognizing the native conformation of gp11 trimer have been selected. Long deletions up to a complete removal of the N-terminal domain, containing 64 residues, do not affect the gp11 trimerization, but considerably change the protein structure and lead to the loss of its ability to incorporate into the baseplate. However, the deletion of the first 17 N-terminal residues results in functionally active protein that can complete the 11
                        --defective phage particles in in vitro complementation assay. This region of the polypeptide chain is probably essential for gp11-gp10 stable complex formation at the early stages of phage baseplate assembly in vivo. A study of the gp10 deletion variants suggests that the central domain of gp10 trimer is responsible for the interaction with gp11.
