Rackspace Named a Leader in Forrester Wave for Hosted Private Cloud

By Scott Crenshaw -  June 22, 2017 






Today, Forrester Research released its latest evaluation of the hosted private cloud market – The Forrester Wave™: Hosted Private Cloud Services, North America, Q2 2017. I’m proud to announce that we were recognized as a leader for our Rackspace OpenStack Private Cloud offering.
The report evaluated nine vendors based on 33 criteria, including current offering, strategy and market presence. In addition to being named a leader, our OpenStack private cloud offering ranked above all vendors in the strategy category and automation capabilities criterion.
We were also among the vendors that scored highest for self-service portal and user interface, integration strength, service level agreements (SLAs), storage and contract agreements criteria. In fact, the Forrester report specifically mentions customer references contacted during the evaluation, which called out Rackspace for our “superior self-service control options relative to other evaluated solutions,” and described them as “best-in-class.” Click here to view the Forrester Wave and download the full report.
The Forrester report comes on the heels of a recently released Gartner report, the “2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service, Worldwide,” in which Rackspace was called “the market leader in industrialized private cloud IaaS.”  The Gartner report also noted that our private cloud-as-a-service offerings are “thoughtfully constructed, more automated than most competing offerings, and operated in a fashion that allows Rackspace to deliver reliable, well-supported services at economical prices and at scale.”
We believe our position in the Forrester Wave report and Gartner’s assessment of our private cloud offerings further validate that we are the clear market leader in the OpenStack private cloud space. As a co-founder of OpenStack, we pioneered the OpenStack private cloud as a service delivery model and were the first to deliver an industry-leading 99.99% API uptime SLA.
We help customers of all sizes succeed with private cloud through operational expertise gained from more than one billion server hours managing OpenStack clouds at scale. And we’ll continue to innovate and lead by providing industry-leading SLAs, world-class economics and a revolutionary, utility-based private cloud consumption model.
To learn more and ask questions about whether OpenStack private cloud as a service might be a good fit for your organization, take advantage of a free strategy session with a private cloud expert — no strings attached. SIGN UP NOW.
