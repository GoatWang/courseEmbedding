History[edit]
In 1959, the Rogers Publishing Company, a publisher of technical news magazines, began indexing product catalogs on microfilm. Microfilming allowed catalogs to be updated without the expense of traditional publishing. In 1961, when Rogers was bought by Cahners Publishing, the catalogs division became Information Handling Services (IHS). IHS initially served the aerospace industry.[8] Early clients included Martin Marietta and Convair. The United States Army Missile Command (MICOM) (now a part of the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM)) contracted with IHS to develop a common parts file to be used by contractors designing new products. In the 1980s, with the advent of the personal computer, IHS added electronic databases and full text CD-ROMs to its delivery methods. In the 1990s, IHS embraced the Internet by distributing its information products through online databases. IHS also expanded beyond the aerospace and defense industries to focus on the energy industry, while continuing to serve the automotive, construction, and electronics sectors. In 2005, IHS became a publicly traded company (NYSE: IHS) and changed its name from Information Handling Services to IHS Inc. IHS is classified as belonging to the publications industry.[9] Since that time, IHS continues to grow both organically and through acquisitions adding additional products and services and expanding the list of industries it serves. IHS (NYSE: IHS) and Markit (NASDAQ: MRKT) announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which the companies combined an all-share merger of equals to create a global leader in critical information, analytics and solutions on March 21, 2016. Based on the closing prices of IHS and Markit common stock on March 18, 2016, the implied equity value of the transaction was valued at more than $13 billion. Upon completion of the merger, the combined company was renamed IHS Markit and the headquarters moved from Englewood, Colorado to London, UK. However, certain key operations are still based in Englewood, Colorado.

Permian Oil Operators’ Lofty Production Targets Supported by Strong 
      Hedging, IHS Markit Says




Permian-focused E&Ps have hedged 65 percent of oil production at more 
      than $50 per barrel




                    	July 25, 2017 12:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time 
                    	



HOUSTON--(EON: Enhanced Online News)--Oil-weighted exploration and production (E&P) companies operating in the 
      prolific Permian basin have 65 percent of their oil production hedged at 
      an average strike price of approximately $50 per barrel. This supports 
      their aggressive production targets for 2017, according to new analysis 
      from IHS 
      Markit (Nasdaq: INFO), a world leader in critical information, 
      analytics and solutions.
    
“At present, it would be a challenge for the Permian E&Ps to replicate 
      their 2017 hedge positions in 2018, given the weakness in oil prices and 
      the relatively flat futures curve”

      The IHS Markit hedging analysis entitled, “Company Peer Group 
      Analysis—Oil-weighted U.S. E&Ps: Permian operators’ lofty production 
      targets supported by strong hedging,” evaluated the oil and gas 
      hedging in place for a group of 18 oil-weighted U.S. E&Ps in the IHS 
      Markit coverage universe, including a subgroup of 10 Permian 
      Basin-focused operators.
    

      Overall, the IHS Markit analysis noted that the Permian-focused 
      oil-weighted E&P peer group has hedged 65 percent of remaining 2017 oil 
      production at a weighted-average implied price of $50 per barrel, and 50 
      percent of remaining 2017 gas production hedged at $3 per Mcf. This 
      compares with just 19 percent of oil production and 29 percent of gas 
      production hedged by the non-Permian E&P oil-weighted peer group in 
      2017, IHS Markit said.
    

      The Permian-focused operators have locked in a substantially higher 
      portion of production than their non-Permian counterparts, providing 
      support for the group’s aggressive production-growth targets, according 
      to the IHS Markit report.
    

      “The different levels of hedging between the two oil-weighted subgroups 
      of Permian versus non-Permian E&P operators is reflected in the wide 
      disparity of their production growth targets, and the difference is 
      striking,” said Paul O’Donnell, principal equity analyst at IHS Markit 
      and author of the hedging analysis. “The median Permian E&P is expected 
      to increase its production by 25 percent in 2017, as compared to those 
      oil-weighted operators outside the Permian who have hedged just 19 
      percent of 2017 oil production and are anticipating a median decline of 
      1 percent in oil/liquids production. Consequently, we expect the Permian 
      E&Ps will be less likely to downwardly revise 2017 spending plans and 
      production targets in the upcoming second-quarter 2017 earnings 
      announcements, compared with their non-Permian counterparts.”
    

      Companies hedge their production to provide a level of protection 
      against oil and gas price fluctuations, and during the period of 
      volatile prices throughout most of 2015 and 2016, North American E&P 
      companies benefitted significantly from having large hedge books, 
      O’Donnell said.
    

      “In 2017, hedging is still important for these E&Ps, especially the more 
      debt-laden companies, which are less likely to withstand sustained low 
      prices or significant price fluctuations,” O’Donnell said. “The 
      oil-weighted peer group increased its 2017 oil hedging from 22 percent 
      to 34 percent since the time of our previous hedging study, based off of 
      third-quarter 2016 data.”
    

      Permian operators with the best downside protection if prices were to 
      drop to $35 per barrel include Concho Resources, Parsley Energy and 
      Laredo Petroleum, who would all have hedged prices above $50 per barrel 
      in 2017 and 2018.
    

      For 2018, the Permian E&Ps have already hedged 25 percent of oil 
      production at $51 per barrel and 9 percent of gas at $3 per Mcf, while 
      the non-Permian E&Ps are largely unhedged for oil, but also have 9 
      percent of their gas production hedged.
    

      “At present, it would be a challenge for the Permian E&Ps to replicate 
      their 2017 hedge positions in 2018, given the weakness in oil prices and 
      the relatively flat futures curve,” O’Donnell said.

History[edit]
In 1959, the Rogers Publishing Company, a publisher of technical news magazines, began indexing product catalogs on microfilm. Microfilming allowed catalogs to be updated without the expense of traditional publishing. In 1961, when Rogers was bought by Cahners Publishing, the catalogs division became Information Handling Services (IHS). IHS initially served the aerospace industry.[8] Early clients included Martin Marietta and Convair. The United States Army Missile Command (MICOM) (now a part of the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM)) contracted with IHS to develop a common parts file to be used by contractors designing new products. In the 1980s, with the advent of the personal computer, IHS added electronic databases and full text CD-ROMs to its delivery methods. In the 1990s, IHS embraced the Internet by distributing its information products through online databases. IHS also expanded beyond the aerospace and defense industries to focus on the energy industry, while continuing to serve the automotive, construction, and electronics sectors. In 2005, IHS became a publicly traded company (NYSE: IHS) and changed its name from Information Handling Services to IHS Inc. IHS is classified as belonging to the publications industry.[9] Since that time, IHS continues to grow both organically and through acquisitions adding additional products and services and expanding the list of industries it serves. IHS (NYSE: IHS) and Markit (NASDAQ: MRKT) announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which the companies combined an all-share merger of equals to create a global leader in critical information, analytics and solutions on March 21, 2016. Based on the closing prices of IHS and Markit common stock on March 18, 2016, the implied equity value of the transaction was valued at more than $13 billion. Upon completion of the merger, the combined company was renamed IHS Markit and the headquarters moved from Englewood, Colorado to London, UK.

Background[edit]
Markit was founded in 2003 by Canadian Lance Uggla[7][8] in St Albans, outside London, as Mark-it Partners to provide daily credit default swap (CDS) pricing.[9]
Markit's credit derivative data sales rose during the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 and later years.[10]
In September 2009 Markit and Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) launched MarkitSERV, a joint venture to provide over-the-counter (OTC) derivative trade processing.[11]
On May 5, 2014, Markit Ltd., a company registered in Bermuda, filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), to be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol MRKT.[2][12] The stock began trading on June 19, 2014 with an initial pricing of $24 per share.[13]
Company performance[edit]

In 2012, the company had annual revenues of USD860 million, with 3000 employees. In 2012, Markit had a $5 billion valuation.[7]
By 2013 Markit served 3,000 institutions across the financial markets which include investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, central banks, regulators, auditors, fund administrators and insurance companies.[3]

Totem Valuations, a supplier of consensus valuations and month-end data, was bought by Markit in May 2004[14]
The International Index Company (IIC) and CDS Index Company (CDSIndexCo), owners of the iTraxx and CDX credit default swap indexes, were acquired by Markit in November 2007[15]

Index products[edit]
On 17 January 2006, CDS IndexCo and Markit launched ABX.HE, a subprime mortgage backed credit derivative index, with planned to extend the index to underlying asset types other than home equity loans.[20][21] In a marketing presentation(2006 & Wiley) CDS IndexCo was described as the owner of the DJ CDX family of credit default swap (CDS) indices formed from a merger of the major CDS indices (iBoxx and Trac-X) in April 2004. It introduced a "second generation product such as index tranches and index options."(Wiley 2006)[22] They launched the Home Equity (ABX.HE) ABX on 19 January 2006. Others, such as Credit Cards (ABX.CC), Student Loans (ABX.SL), Auto Loans (ABX.AU) were to be announced in the future. Advertised daily prices were available on the Markit website. The purpose of the indices is to allow investors to trade exposures to the subprime market without holding the actual asset backed securities. The ABX.HE Index was created from "qualifying deals of 20 of the largest sub-prime home equity ABS shelf programs from the six month period preceding the roll."(Wiley, 2006 & 11) The market makers of ABX.HE were listed JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Barclays Capital, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, RBS Greenwich, UBS and Wachovia.(Wiley, 2006 & 13)

On 17 The ABX index was a credit default swap of asset-backed mortgages of 30 of the most liquid mortgage-backed bonds. Hedge funds began shorting that ABX index in early 2006 at par. The Deutsche Bank, alone, reportedly made $250 million.(2007 & Lenzer)[23]

Current Cross-Industry TrendWhat do guns and oil have in common?Five countries—Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, Colombia, and Syria—accounted for over three-quarters of the total terrorism attacks on energy infrastructure and assets recorded by IHS Markit between 2013 and 2014. As a strategic asset, oil and gas infrastructure will always be an attractive target for individuals and groups who want to publicly air grievances. These are highly localized problems.

Used strategically, they hold the key to launching and sustaining value across markets. But neither is without risk. The price that a company sets—especially in emerging markets—can be fraught with both financial and social ramifications.

History[edit]
In 1959, the Rogers Publishing Company, a publisher of technical news magazines, began indexing product catalogs on microfilm. Microfilming allowed catalogs to be updated without the expense of traditional publishing. In 1961, when Rogers was bought by Cahners Publishing, the catalogs division became Information Handling Services (IHS). IHS initially served the aerospace industry.[8] Early clients included Martin Marietta and Convair. The United States Army Missile Command (MICOM) (now a part of the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM)) contracted with IHS to develop a common parts file to be used by contractors designing new products. In the 1980s, with the advent of the personal computer, IHS added electronic databases and full text CD-ROMs to its delivery methods. In the 1990s, IHS embraced the Internet by distributing its information products through online databases. IHS also expanded beyond the aerospace and defense industries to focus on the energy industry, while continuing to serve the automotive, construction, and electronics sectors. In 2005, IHS became a publicly traded company (NYSE: IHS) and changed its name from Information Handling Services to IHS Inc. IHS is classified as belonging to the publications industry.[9] Since that time, IHS continues to grow both organically and through acquisitions adding additional products and services and expanding the list of industries it serves. IHS (NYSE: IHS) and Markit (NASDAQ: MRKT) announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which the companies combined an all-share merger of equals to create a global leader in critical information, analytics and solutions on March 21, 2016. Based on the closing prices of IHS and Markit common stock on March 18, 2016, the implied equity value of the transaction was valued at more than $13 billion.

Others, such as Credit Cards (ABX.CC), Student Loans (ABX.SL), Auto Loans (ABX.AU) were to be announced in the future. Advertised daily prices were available on the Markit website. The purpose of the indices is to allow investors to trade exposures to the subprime market without holding the actual asset backed securities.
