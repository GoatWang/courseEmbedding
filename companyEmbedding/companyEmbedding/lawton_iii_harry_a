New Look!
We're giving our products a new look but as always, it’s what’s on the inside that counts. That’s why the formulas are still the same.








5 German blades. Flex hinge. Lubricating strip. Precision trimmer.
Everything you need for a close, comfortable shave: sharp, durable blades, a flex hinge, a lubricating strip, and a precision trimmer for your sideburns and hard-to-reach places like under your nose.








Increased Control
The Truman handle is designed with a rubberized matte exterior, texturized grip pattern, and weighted core for maximum grip and control. It may be the best-looking thing in your bathroom (other than you.) 








Smooth Shave
Our Foaming Shave Gel lathers into a rich foam, while our Shave Cream has a smooth texture. Both help your razor glide effortlessly over your skin for a close, comfortable shave.

New Look!
We're giving our products a new look but as always, it’s what’s on the inside that counts. That’s why the formulas are still the same.








5 German blades. Flex hinge. Lubricating strip. Precision trimmer.
Everything you need for a close, comfortable shave: sharp, durable blades, a flex hinge, a lubricating strip, and a precision trimmer for your sideburns and hard-to-reach places like under your nose.








Increased Control
The ergonomic body is made of die-cast zinc and polished chrome for a handsome finish and a rubberized grip for optimal control. For a more personalized experience, get it engraved.








Smooth Shave
Our Foaming Shave Gel lathers into a rich foam, while our Shave Cream has a smooth texture. Both help your razor glide effortlessly over your skin for a close, comfortable shave.
