Women in Business Q&A: Roxane Divol, SVP and GM, Trust Services, Symantec






By Laura Dunn

































As the General Manager (GM) of Symantec's Trust Services, Roxane Divol is responsible for the end-to-end optimization and growth of the Trust Services business. This business offers industry leading SSL certificates, code signing, and certificate management offerings.
Roxane joined the Symantec leadership team in 2013 as Senior Vice (SVP) President of Alliances, where she drove thought leadership and actions across Symantec's products and services organization on matters related to long-term strategy, technology alliances, partnerships, and operations. Her responsibilities included leading and growing the Internet of Things offerings, Technical Services organization, and Products and Services Strategy and Operations, as well as leading the long-term strategy review for Symantec.
Symantec is the world's largest security-software maker, providing security, storage, and systems management solutions to help customers secure and manage their information-driven world, across their environment.
Prior to joining Symantec, Roxane was a Partner at McKinsey & Company for more than 15 years as a leader of its Marketing and Sales Practice on the U.S. West Coast, as well as the Technology, Media, Telecom Practice. In that role, she helped clients develop effective organizations, increase return on their investments, and develop go-to-market approaches that delivered the most value. She also created and led McKinsey's West Coast Executive Women's Roundtable series.
Roxane holds dual French and Colombian citizenship. Her cross-cultural experiences have helped her to assess and transform global organizations. She is a director at Wolverine Worldwide and currently sits on several non-for-profit boards (Lycee Francais de San Francisco, Global Fund for Women, and the Battery Foundation). Roxane is passionate about women's rights, including access to education, healthcare, jobs, voting rights, and other inequities facing women and people across the globe.
How has your life experience made you the leaders you are today?
I'm half French and half Colombian, and have lived in France, Colombia and the U.S.: being a global citizen has had a big influence on the leader I am today. For instance, I constantly consider diversity of thought on my teams - this can come from various educational, professional, cultural or gender backgrounds.
During my upbringing anything less than excellence was considered not good enough - this set high aspirations for me and taught me to be ambitious, which translates to what I expect of my teams and how I lead. I also became sensitized early on being one of few women pursuing a STEM career. I think that plays into my leadership style as well.How has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at Symantec?
I was a management consultant for 17 years before coming to Symantec. The nature of that work was project-driven, so having the experience of constant new projects and new things to solve has been helpful in what Symantec is going through with its own change and transformation. In management consulting you're exercising all the muscles given it spans such a wide roadmap - marketing, sales, profit improvement, etc. - and you're also tasked with asking a lot of questions to understand the problem and quickly provide a solution. My role at Symantec has changed five times since I started, but my consulting background has given me the flexibility to actually enjoy this change!What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at Symantec?
 There  have been many highlights! I have embraced my changing roles. I've had a fantastic time with it because there are some big things Symantec needs to resolve and to be a part of that - accelerating towards the answer - is really fulfilling. My current highlight is the GM role, accountability in the business and what that entails. I am very motivated by the responsibility I have over a highly functional team and the way to take that to the next level.
In terms of challenges, I have faced some skepticism. After 17 years, I was assumed to be a lifetime consultant; people feared I would be paralyzed by my desire to analyze, too demanding, not practical enough. This was also exacerbated by how I came across, demanding yes, but with a different tone, style and voice - driven by my background and my gender. This created a double disconnect sometimes, that I needed to overcome.  I have also had to learn how to operate in a world where you - and your team- are running the Sahara Ultra-marathon, as opposed to a sprint to the corner store. It is a different operating model, where you need to blend sense of urgency with sustainability. What advice can you offer to women who want a career in information security?
The ideal combination is meaning and opportunity, and there is huge meaning and opportunity in this field: I would definitely encourage women to consider this field. Indeed, we're living increasingly digital lives and in that context information security is a critical component of progress - a career in this space provides many opportunities, especially because we have a big talent shortage. And in addition you're doing something good.  My advice for succeeding in this field is to find people and sponsors who believe in you. If you are interested in this topic there's no reason not to go for it.What is the most important lesson you've learned in your career to date?
Grit and resilience. Among successful people, I think the single thing that stands out is resilience: be tough and hang on. This has manifested in multiple ways for me -- for example, after I had kids, I made the choice to come back to a career with a lot of travel - it was all about grit. Soon after, the economy went down and I had to reinvent myself - I had to push through and stay tough in the face of adversity. At the end of the day it's about resilience, and grit...How do you maintain a work/life balance?
I think the core of leadership work is a job that you derive meaning from, so I continually get fulfillment from my career. I try to minimize time spent on things that aren't fulfilling or aren't what I want to take on. Another huge factor is who your spouse or life partner is: in my case it takes two to make it doable. Manage what gives you energy. My situation works because we have a family construct and we set expectations with our children.What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?
It is all about biases. The first and most insidious one  was that people didn't ask me if I wanted to take on hard assignments when I came back from maternity leave. They just assumed I'd say no because of my increased maternal responsibilities. This was extremely disempowering because people didn't even ask - they just assumed. I know they were well-intended but at the same time blinded by their biases. In addition, it is frequent for groups in high tech to question women's competencies. That goes away in groups where the talent pool becomes more balanced.How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?
Well, for starters, I'm not good at asking for help! But there have been people looking out for me who created a safety net without me even knowing. When I first joined Symantec, a former colleague gave my boss advice on working with me and said to give me challenging assignments - a week later the scope of my responsibility was increased.  I can think of a handful of individuals who created real tangible opportunities for me during my career, because they had seen me rise to the challenge.Which other female leaders do you admire and why?
I admire the decision Sheryl Sandberg made to be an activist on women's issues. I've spent a lot of time on this topic and she's taken it to a whole new level. I also admire Christine Lagarde's, Managing Director, International Monetary Fund (IMF), journey. As a French woman in an American-based institution, watching her success has been inspiring.What do you want Symantec to accomplish in the next year? 
Symantec is in the middle of a split, so executing that successfully is a business priority, as well as the momentum gained coming out of the split. I don't just want to meet deadlines during this process, I want it to create momentum for the company.  Our renewed focus on improving the diversity of our workforce and the inclusiveness of our culture will help us better meet our customer needs and rise to this challenge.  Our multiyear diversity strategy will help us better compete for global talent, especially those women who see information security is a field for them to thrive.

Women rarely reach top in tech, despite signs that diversity pays

Work wasn’t the same after tech consultant Roxane Divol returned from maternity leave. She no longer received the best assignments, especially those requiring travel, because her colleagues assumed she wanted to stay close to home as she had a child. 
She confronted a senior male colleague, telling him to stop asking if she was OK and to help her tap into the best opportunities at the firm.

LEE: Silicon Valley needs women board members









EBay becomes latest tech firm to boost parental leave policy









Opinion: Perfection is the enemy of ‘having it all’



“I get it,” she recalled the male colleague saying. “I guess you are the man in your family.”



It’s the kind of sexism women still face daily as they push for equal representation in the workplace, especially in tech, which has specific and unusual gender problems. Female engineers represent a tiny minority at many companies, with even fewer women in the upper echelons of leadership. A Chronicle analysis of the Bay Area’s top 15 publicly traded tech firms by workforce shows that only a handful have a significant number of female managers reporting directly to the CEO.


At several companies, women represented 20 percent or less of a company’s executive team. The company with the highest percentage was Cisco Systems Inc. with women representing 36 percent of the executive team, while the lowest was Fremont’s Synnex Corp., which lists no women on its leadership team.
Studies have shown that companies with more female leaders have better financial results, experts said. Without more diversity, marketing campaigns can play to gender stereotypes, or release products taking into account only a man’s perspective.
“Companies that do not utilize women in top management positions are really giving up 50 percent of the talent,” said Michalle Mor Barak, author of “Managing Diversity: Toward a Globally Inclusive Workplace.” Those firms “are not only not doing the right thing, but also harming themselves in the long run,” she said.

Women rarely reach top in tech, despite signs that diversity pays

To be sure, some tech companies have high-profile female executives, but those women have few peers at their companies. That’s the case at Facebook for Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat at Google’s parent company, Alphabet.
The sexism directed toward top female executives can be blatant. In a meeting with investors, Michelle Forsythe, CEO of NoteStream in Lake Forest (Orange County), fielded questions about what it was like working with her husband and whether they had any children. Meanwhile, her husband — the company’s chief technology officer — got questions about the business behind the startup’s learning app.
“The raw truth is this: Sexism is alive and well in the tech industry. It hides behind polite smiles and discreet glances at the clock. It masquerades as interest, but manifests as condescension,” Forsythe said, later adding, “I’m a woman CEO with data to back the success of my app. Let’s talk about that.”

























































Trend in other industries
The trend of fewer women at the top isn’t just in tech but across other industries. A study released in 2015 by McKinsey & Co. and nonprofit LeanIn.Org showed that even though women and men are almost equally represented in entry-level positions, fewer women get promoted to each higher level. By the time women reach senior vice president, they represent just 23 percent of the positions, the study said. C-suite representation is even less at just 17 percent, according to the study’s data, which tracked 118 companies, including 26 in tech.
“We’ve lost women every step of the way,” said Lareina Yee, a partner at McKinsey & Co.
As women climb the corporate ladder, many of them are promoted through “staff roles,” or positions related to legal, human resources and IT, while fewer high-ranking women hold “line roles” that deal directly with the company’s finances or core operations, according to the study. In the C-suite — the highest level of executive leadership — only 43 of the female executives are in “line” positions such as chief development officer. The people who hold these roles often later become CEO.

Starting families while working may represent another challenge. More women than men with children say they don’t want the top job because of the stress associated with it, and they don’t feel they can balance their work and family commitments, according to the McKinsey survey of roughly 30,000 employees.
Unconscious bias 
Biases also influence why women don’t advance to higher positions within a company, Yee said, referring to unconscious bias, where “women are often looked at for their performance and men just on their potential.” 
Some tech companies are working to address this through mentorship programs and special opportunities for employees to learn about their companies’ other departments.

Many women face challenges because they are seen as being so different by male colleagues in the workplace.
                
                    
Vice President of product marketing Jamie Domenici leaves the...
San Francisco cloud computing company Salesforce piloted a program for roughly 20 high-potential female leaders, mostly at the vice president level. Through the program, Sara Varni, a vice president of marketing, networked with senior executives around the company, broadening her perspective about what she could do at Salesforce. She worked with a coach on improving her presentation skills. The experience gave her the confidence to speak in front of more than 4,000 people at Dreamforce in September, and ultimately, what she learned helped her land a promotion to senior vice president of marketing for Sales Cloud.
Challenges at top
But once you reach senior circles with few or no other women, there are still hurdles. Divol, now senior vice president and general manager of Trust Services at Symantec, said there’s still the “challenge of being so different.”
“If you are asking different questions, you look different, you dress different, you sound different — it can be offensive to folks,” Divol said.

Author Mor Barak said it’s important that companies allow women and other underrepresented communities to show perspectives that make them unique, rather than force them to fit into the existing culture.
The talent “will be stifled if they are expected to behave like the mainstream,” Mor Barak said.
After Divol joined Symantec, some people said she was hard to work with. Her executive coach interviewed her peers about it, and learned that because everything about her was different, it was a lot for people to absorb. One of the male colleagues, as she recalled, said: “You know, Roxane, you bring up really good questions, but everything about you is so surprising. You dress different, you have a different angle on things — it’s a lot of things for us to take on.”
Ultimately, Divol realized she needed to treat her colleagues like she did her clients when she was a consultant, “with a little bit of care and cocooning with how I support the same topic.”
Pay inequality persists
Female executives in tech are still struggling with equal compensation. Median pay for female executive officers was about $3.7 million, nearly $893,000 less than their male counterparts, according to research firm Equilar. That gap was more pronounced in tech compared with other sectors, including finance, consumer goods and utilities, Equliar said.
With many male founders (think Google’s Larry Page or Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg) owning equity in their companies, that factors into the pay. The disparity stems from the very beginning, with a higher percentage of startups founded by white men landing more venture funding.
It will take a while before the percentage of female leaders increases across all industries. McKinsey & Co.’s study says it will take more than 100 years to reach parity at the C-suite level and 25 years at the senior vice president level at the rate progress has happened since 2012.
Having their say
Divol is doing her part to reduce that wait. At Symantec, she learned that a male employee was up for a promotion, but a female employee, in a similar position who was also ranked very well, was not getting promoted. “When these numbers are off balance, it gives me the opportunity to ask why,” Divol said.
She asked her team to either promote them both or keep them at the same level. Both were promoted. 
Maggie Wilderotter, executive chairman of Frontier Communications Corp., was instrumental in the shift at her company. When she joined as CEO and president in 2004, there were no women on the board or any female executive reporting directly to the top boss. Today, three out of seven female executives report to the president and 42 percent of the board are female.
“The good news for our company was I was at the top. I am also a woman,” Wilderotter said. “I basically said this is good business, and this is what we are going to do.”

                As the marketing power of social media grows, it no longer makes sense to treat it as an experiment. Here’s how senior leaders can harness social media to shape consumer decision 
making in predictable ways.
            
Executives certainly know what social media is. After all, if Facebook users constituted a country, it would be the world’s third largest, behind China and India. Executives can even claim to know what makes social media so potent: its ability to amplify word-of-mouth effects. Yet the vast majority of executives have no idea how to harness social media’s power. Companies diligently establish Twitter feeds and branded Facebook pages, but few have a deep understanding of exactly how social media interacts with consumers to expand product and brand recognition, drive sales and profitability, and engender loyalty.
We believe there are two interrelated reasons why social media remains an enigma wrapped in a riddle for many executives, particularly nonmarketers. The first is its seemingly nebulous nature. It’s no secret that consumers increasingly go online to discuss products and brands, seek advice, and offer guidance. Yet it’s often difficult to see where and how to influence these conversations, which take place across an ever-growing variety of platforms, among diverse and dispersed communities, and may occur either with lightning speed or over the course of months. Second, there’s no single measure of social media’s financial impact, and many companies find that it’s difficult to justify devoting significant resources—financial or human—to an activity whose precise effect remains unclear.

What we hope to do here is to demystify social media. We have identified its four primary functions—to monitor, respond, amplify, and lead consumer behavior—and linked them to the journey consumers undertake when making purchasing decisions. Being able to identify exactly how, when, and where social media influences consumers helps executives to craft marketing strategies that take advantage of social media’s unique ability to engage with customers. It should also help leaders develop, launch, and demonstrate the financial impact of social-media campaigns (for insight into the world’s biggest social-media market, see “Understanding social media in China”).
In short, today’s chief executive can no longer treat social media as a side activity run solely by managers in marketing or public relations. It’s much more than simply another form of paid marketing, and it demands more too: a clear framework to help CEOs and other top executives evaluate investments in it, a plan for building support infrastructure, and performance-management systems to help leaders smartly scale their social presence. Companies that have these three elements in place can create critical new brand assets (such as content from customers or insights from their feedback), open up new channels for interactions (Twitter-based customer service, Facebook news feeds), and completely reposition a brand through the way its employees interact with customers or other parties.
The social consumer decision journey
Companies have quickly learned that social media works: 39 percent of companies we’ve surveyed already use social-media services as their primary digital tool to reach customers, and that percentage is expected to rise to 47 percent within the next four years.1 1. See “What marketers say about working online: McKinsey Global Survey results,” November 2011. Fueling this growth is a growing list of success stories from mainstream companies:
Creating buzz: Eighteen months before Ford reentered the US subcompact-car market with its Fiesta model, it began a broad marketing campaign called the Fiesta Movement. A major element involved giving 100 social-media influencers a European model of the car, having them complete “missions,” and asking them to document their experiences on various social channels. Videos related to the Fiesta campaign generated 6.5 million views on YouTube, and Ford received 50,000 requests for information about the vehicle, primarily from non-Ford drivers. When it finally became available to the public, in late 2010, some 10,000 cars sold in the first six days.
Learning from customers: PepsiCo has used social networks to gather customer insights via its DEWmocracy promotions, which have led to the creation of new varieties of its Mountain Dew brand. Since 2008, the company has sold more than 36 million cases of them.
Targeting customers: Levi Strauss has used social media to offer location-specific deals. In one instance, direct interactions with just 400 consumers led 1,600 people to turn up at the company’s stores— an example of social media’s word-of-mouth effect.
Yet countless others have failed to match these successes: knowing that something works and understanding how it works are very different things. As the number of companies with Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, or online communities continues to grow, we think it’s time for leaders to remind themselves how social media connects with an organization’s broader marketing mission.
Marketing’s primary goal is to reach consumers at the moments, or touch points, that influence their purchasing behavior. Almost three years ago, our colleagues proposed a framework—the “consumer decision journey”—for understanding how consumers interact with companies during purchase decisions.2 2. See David Court, Dave Elzinga, Susan Mulder, and Ole Jørgen Vetvik, “The consumer decision journey,” McKinsey Quarterly, June 2009. Expressing consumer behavior as a winding journey with multiple feedback loops, this new framework was different from the traditional description of consumer purchasing behavior as a linear march through a funnel. Social media is a unique component of the consumer decision journey: it’s the only form of marketing that can touch consumers at each and every stage, from when they’re pondering brands and products right through the period after a purchase, as their experience influences the brands they prefer and their potential advocacy influences others.

The fact that social media can influence customers at every stage of the journey doesn’t mean that it should. Depending on the company and industry, some touch points are more important to competitive advantage than others.3 3. Readers interested in a detailed approach for understanding which touch points matter—based on research techniques that reveal what consumers are seeing, saying, and doing—should read David Edelman, “Branding in the digital age: You’re spending your money in all the wrong places,” Harvard Business Review, December 2010, Volume 88, Number 12, pp. 62–69. What’s more, our work with dozens of companies adapting to the new marketing environment strongly suggests that the most powerful social-media strategies focus on a limited number of marketing responses closely related to individual touch points along the consumer decision journey. The ten most important responses, range from providing customer service to fostering online communities (exhibit). One of those ten—monitoring what people say about your brand—is so important that we see it as a core function of social media, relevant across the entire consumer decision journey. The remaining nine responses, organized in three clusters in the exhibit, underpin efforts to use social media to respond to consumer comments, to amplify positive sentiment and activity, and to lead changes in the behavior and mind-sets of consumers.

                Social media enables targeted marketing responses at individual touch points along the consumer decision journey.
            








1. Monitor
Gatorade, a sports drink manufactured by PepsiCo, has been diligently working toward its goal of becoming the “largest participatory brand in the world.”4 4. Comment by Carla Hassan, Gatorade’s senior marketing director, consumer and shopper engagement. For more, see Adam Ostrow, “Inside Gatorade’s social media command center,” mashable.com, June 15, 2010. It has created a Chicago-based “war room” within its marketing department to monitor the brand in real time across social media. There are seats where team members can track custom-built data visualizations and dashboards (including terms related to the brand, sponsored athletes, and competitors) and run sentiment analyses around product and campaign launches. Every day, all of this feedback is integrated into products and marketing—for example, by helping to optimize the landing page on the company’s Web site. Since the war room’s creation, the average traffic to Gatorade’s online properties, the length of visitor interactions, and viral sharing from campaigns have all more than doubled.
Such brand monitoring—simply knowing what’s said online about your products and services—should be a default social-media function, taking place constantly. Even without engaging consumers directly, companies can glean insights from an effective monitoring program that informs everything from product design to marketing and provides advance warning of potentially negative publicity. It’s also critical to communicate such feedback within the business quickly: whoever is charged with brand monitoring must ensure that information reaches relevant functions, such as communications, design, marketing, public relations, or risk.
2. Respond
Valuable though it is to learn how you are doing and what to improve, broad and passive monitoring is only a start. Pinpointing conversations for responding at a personal level is another form of social-media engagement. This kind of response can certainly be positive if it’s done to provide customer service or to uncover sales leads. Most often, though, responding is a part of crisis management.
Last year, for example, a hoax photograph posted online claimed that McDonald’s was charging African-Americans an additional service fee. The hoax first appeared on Twitter, where the image rapidly went viral just before the weekend as was retweeted with the hashtag #seriouslymcdonalds. It turned out to be a working weekend for the McDonald’s social-media team. On Saturday, the company’s director of social media released a statement through Twitter declaring the photograph to be a hoax and asking key influencers to “please let your followers know.” The company continued to reinforce that message throughout the weekend, even responding personally to concerned Tweeters. By Sunday, the number of people who believed the image to be authentic had dwindled, and McDonald’s stock price rose 5 percent the following day.
Responding in order to counter negative comments and reinforce positive ones will only increase in importance. The responsibility for taking action may fall on functions outside marketing, and the message will differ depending on the situation. No response can be quick enough, and the ability to act rapidly requires the constant, proactive monitoring of social media—on weekends too. By responding rapidly, transparently, and honestly, companies can positively influence consumer sentiment and behavior.
3. Amplify
“Amplification” involves designing your marketing activities to have an inherently social motivator that spurs broader engagement and sharing. This approach means more than merely reaching the end of planning a marketing campaign and then thinking that “we should do something social”—say, uploading a television commercial to YouTube. It means that the core concepts for campaigns must invite customers into an experience that they can choose to extend by joining a conversation with the brand, product, fellow users, and other enthusiasts. It means having ongoing programs that share new content with customers and provide opportunities for sharing back. It means offering experiences that customers will feel great about sharing, because they gain a badge of honor by publicizing content that piques the interest of others.
In the initial phases of the consumer decision journey, when consumers sift through brands and products to determine their preferred options, referrals and recommendations are powerful social-media tools. A simple example is the way online deal sites such as Groupon and Gilt Groupe provide consumers with credit for each first-time purchaser they refer. Our research shows that such direct recommendations from peers generate engagement rates some 30 times higher than traditional online advertising does.
Once a consumer has decided which product to buy and makes a purchase, companies can use social media to amplify their engagement and foster loyalty. When Starbucks wanted to increase awareness of its brand, for example, it launched a competition challenging users to be the first to tweet a photograph of one of the new advertising posters that the company had placed in six major US cities, providing winners with a $20 gift card. This social-media brand advocacy effort delivered a marketing punch that significantly outweighed its budget. Starbucks said that the effort was “the difference between launching with millions of dollars versus millions of fans.”5 5. See Claire Cain Miller, “New Starbucks ads seek to recruit online fans,” nytimes.com, May 18, 2009. 
Marketers also can foster communities around their brands and products, both to reinforce the belief of consumers that they made a smart decision and to provide guidance for getting the most from a purchase. Software company Intuit, for example, launched customer service forums for its Quicken and QuickBooks personal-finance software so users could help one another with product issues. The result? Users rather than Intuit employees answer about 80 percent of the questions, and the company has employed user comments to make dozens of significant changes to its software.
4. Lead
Social media can be used most proactively to lead consumers toward long-term behavioral changes. In the early stages of the consumer decision journey, this may involve boosting brand awareness by driving Web traffic to content about existing products and services. When grooming-products group Old Spice introduced its Old Spice Man character to viewers, during the US National Football League’s 2010 Super Bowl, for example, the company’s ambition was to increase its reach and relevance to both men and women. The commercial became a phenomenon: starring former player Isaiah Mustafa, it got more than 19 million hits across all platforms, and year-on-year sales for the company’s products jumped by 27 percent within six months.
Marketers also can use social media to generate buzz through product launches, as Ford did in launching its Fiesta vehicle in the United States. For example, social media played an integral role in the success of “Small Business Saturday,” the US shopping promotion created by American Express for the weekend immediately following Thanksgiving (for American Express CMO John Hayes’s perspective on that launch, see “How we see it: Three senior executives on the future of marketing”). In addition, when consumers are ready to buy, companies can promote time-sensitive targeted deals and offers through social media to generate traffic and sales. Online menswear company Bonobos, for example, provided an incentive for its Twitter followers by unlocking a discount code after its messages were resent a certain number of times. As a result of this effort, almost 100 consumers bought products from the site for the first time. The campaign delivered a 1,200 percent return on investment in just 24 hours.
Finally, social media can solicit consumer input after the purchase. This ability to gain product-development insights from customers in a relatively inexpensive way is emerging as one of social media’s most significant advantages. Intuit, for example, has its community forums. Starbucks uses MyStarbucksIdea.com to collect its customers’ views about improving the company’s products and services and then aggregates submitted ideas and prominently displays them on a dedicated Web site. That site groups ideas by product, experience, and involvement; ranks user participation; and shows ideas actively under consideration by the company and those that have been implemented.
Converting knowledge to action
Despite offering numerous opportunities to influence consumers, social media still accounts for less than 1 percent of an average marketing budget, in our experience. Many chief marketing officers say that they want to increase that share to 5 percent. One problem is that a lot of senior executives know little about social media. But the main obstacle is the perception that the return on investment (ROI) from such initiatives is uncertain.
Without a clear sense of the value social media creates, it’s perhaps not surprising that so many CEOs and other senior executives don’t feel comfortable when their companies go beyond mere “experiments” with social-media strategy. Yet we can measure the impact of social media well beyond straight volume and consumer-sentiment metrics; in fact, we can precisely determine the buzz surrounding a product or brand and then calculate how social media drives purchasing behavior. To do so—and then ensure that social media complements broader marketing strategies—companies must obviously coordinate data, tools, technology, and talent across multiple functions. In many cases, senior business leaders must open up their agendas and recognize the importance of supporting and even undertaking initiatives that may traditionally have been left to the chief marketing officer. As our colleagues noted last year, “we’re all marketers now.”6 6. See Tom French, Laura LaBerge, and Paul Magill, “We’re all marketers now,” McKinsey Quarterly, July 2011. 
Consider the experience of a telecommunications company that proactively adopted social media but had no idea if its efforts were working. The company had launched Twitter-based customer service capabilities, several promotional campaigns built around social contests, a fan page with discounts and tech tips, and an active response program to engage with people speaking about the brand. In social-media terms, the investment was relatively large, and the company’s senior executives wanted more than anecdotal evidence that the strategy was paying off. As a starting point, to ensure that the company was doing a quality job designing and executing its social presence, it benchmarked its efforts against approaches used by other companies known to be successful in social media. It then advanced the following hypotheses:


If all of these social-media activities improve general service perceptions about the brand, that improvement should be reflected in a higher volume of positive online posts.7 7. There’s no shortage of methods purporting to measure social media’s presence and impact. The company in this example used BuzzMetrics, a suite of tools developed by NM Incite (a joint venture between Nielsen and McKinsey). 


If social sharing is effective, added clicks and traffic should result in higher search placements.


If both of these assumptions hold true, social-media activity should help drive sales—ideally, at a rate even higher than the company could achieve with its average gross rating point (GRP) of advertising expenditures.8 8. Gross rating points measure the size of the audience a specific media vehicle reaches. To calculate them, multiply the percentage of the target audience an advertisement reaches by the number of times it airs. 


The company then tested its options. At various times, it spent less money on conventional advertising, especially as social-media activity ramped up, and it modeled the rising positive sentiment and higher search positions just as it would using traditional metrics. The company concluded that social-media activity not only boosted sales but also had higher ROIs than traditional marketing did. Thus, while the company took a risk by shifting emphasis toward social-media efforts before it had data confirming that this was the correct course, the bet paid off. What’s more, the analytic baseline now in place has given the company confidence to continue exploring a growing role for social media.
In other cases, social media may have a more specific role, such as helping to launch a new product or to mitigate negative word of mouth. Similar types of analyses can focus on mixing the impact of buzz, search, and traffic; correlating that with sales or renewals (or whatever the key metric may be); and then gauging the result against total costs. This approach can give executives the confidence and focus they need to invest more money, time, and resources in social media.
As these social-media activities gain scale, the challenges center less around justifying funding and more around organizational issues such as developing the right processes and governance structure, identifying clear roles—for all involved in social-media strategy, from marketing to customer service to product development—and bolstering the talent base, and improving performance standards. New capabilities abound, and social-media best practices are barely starting to emerge. We do know this: because social-media influences every element of the consumer decision journey, communication must take place between as well as within functions. That complicates lines of reporting and decision-making authority.
If insights from monitoring social media are relevant to nonmarketing functions such as product development, for instance, how will you identify and disseminate that information efficiently and effectively—and then ensure that it gets used? If you spot an opportunity to have a meaningful conversation with a key influencer, how will you quickly engage the right senior executive to follow through? If you recognize a fast-moving service concern, how will you respond rapidly and openly—and when should you do so outside the traditional service organization? Senior executives across the company must recognize and begin to answer such questions.

Social media is extending the disruptive impact of the digital era across a broad range of functions. Meanwhile, the perceived lack of metrics, the fear, and the limited sense of what’s possible are eroding. Executives can identify the functions, touch points, and goals of social-media activities, as well as craft approaches to measure their impact and manage their risks. The time is ripe for executive-suite discussions on how to lead and to learn from people within your company, marketers outside it, and, most of all, your customers.
