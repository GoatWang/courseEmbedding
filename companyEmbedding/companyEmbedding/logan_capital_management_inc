The founding partners Al Besse, Stephen Lee and Dana Stewardson originally came together in 1993 because of their common philosophy of growth investing and a top-down approach to fixed income investing.
The firm began managing the Logan Growth strategy (mid- to large cap growth) in 1993 and introduced Logan Large Cap Growth in 1997. Over the years, the firm has carefully added strategies through the acquisitions of teams to balance the business, patiently growing a healthy, diversified investment management company.
The Partners'  complementary strengths power both the investment decisions and the evolution of the firm. Both our client base and our Client Service Team have grown steadily and purposefully over the years.
Today, Logan has a mix of growth, value, core and international equity strategies and a range of fixed income strategies that serve the needs of our clients without any sacrifice of the high-quality personal service to which they have grown accustomed
