History[edit]
19th century[edit]




The building in which George A. Hormel started his business. Preserved at the Mower County Fairgrounds in Austin.


George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer. His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there, borrow $500, and open a meat business. Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail side. The two dissolved their partnership in 1891 so that Hormel could start a complete meat packing operation on his own.[8] He opened George A. Hormel & Co. in the northeast part of Austin in an old creamery building on the Cedar River. To make ends meet in those early days, Hormel continued to trade in hides, eggs, wool, and poultry. Joining George in November 1891 was his youngest brother, Benjamin, age 14. By the end of 1891 Hormel employed six men and had slaughtered and sold 610 head of livestock. By 1893, the increased use of refrigerator cars and greater efficiency had forced smaller businesses to collapse. Two additional Hormel brothers, Herman and John, joined the business that same year, and together they processed 1,532 hogs. The remaining members of the Hormel family moved to Austin in 1895 and joined the growing business. George turned to full-time management in 1899, and focused on increasing production.[9]
1900s[edit]
In 1901, the plant was expanded and the business was incorporated. The first directors were A.L. Eberhart and the four Hormel brothers: George, Herman, John and Ben. In 1903 George decided to add a three-story hog-kill, a two-story beef-kill, an annex, an engine room, a machine shop and a casing production department.[10] The name Dairy Brand was registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1903. In the first decade of the 20th century distribution centers were opened in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Birmingham. George Hormel visited England in 1905 and started exporting products soon after.[11]
1910s[edit]
By 1910, Hormel products were routinely appearing in national magazines.[12] That same year the company developed a procedure to recycle its waste water by daily evaporating up to 9,000 gallons of water, leaving a syrupy liquid which was dried to produce a commercial fertilizer. In 1915 Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar Cervelat, Holsteiner and Noxall Salami.[13] That same year Hormel bought Alderson's Mill and began selling Hormel Peerless Minnesota flour nationwide.[14] Hormel joined the World War I effort, George's son Jay C. went into military service[15] and by the end of the war, exports accounted for 33% of the company's yearly volume.[16]
1920s[edit]




The Hormel plant circa 1920


In 1921, when Jay Hormel returned from service in WWI, he uncovered that assistant controller Cy Thomson had embezzled $1,187,000 from the company over the previous ten years. The embezzlement scandal provided George Hormel with additional incentive to fortify his company. He did so by arranging for more reliable capital management, by dismissing unproductive employees, and by continuing to develop new products.[17] In 1926, the company introduced Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham, America's first canned ham and it added chicken to its line in 1928.[18] Jay C. Hormel became company president in 1929 and that same year the plant was expanded again to include eight new structures and the main office was tripled in size.[19] In the late 1920s and early 1930s sales branches opened in Houston, Beaumont, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Newark, Los Angeles, Vicksburg, and Nuevo Laredo (Mexico).[20]
1930s[edit]
In 1931, Jay C. instituted the Annual Wage Plan: under this plan, employees were paid weekly and they were guaranteed 52 weeks' notice before termination of employment.[21] He also introduced incentive pay, profit sharing and pension plans to the company.[22] Later that year a slaughtering plant was constructed in Mitchell, South Dakota, and in 1933, a cattle slaughtering plant was finished in Austin. John G. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1933 following 40 years of service.[23] Dinty Moore beef stew was introduced in 1935 first created by Ryen "Gunns" Gunning and Hormel Chili and Spam soon followed in 1936 and 1937 respectively.[24] In 1938, Jay C. Hormel introduced the "Joint Savings Plan" which allowed employees to share in the proceeds of the company.[25] By the late-1930s, full-page, four color ads were routinely appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Hormel ads also were featured on the radio program The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.
In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation's first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO).[26][27][28]
The 1930s also saw the establishment of the Hormel & Co. refrigerator car line, with an initial roster of 125 units.
1940s[edit]




The Hormel obelisk in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery.


After reaching sales of $75 million in 1941, George and Jay established The Hormel Foundation to provide perpetual independence of the company, act as trustees of the family trusts and to start and fund The Hormel Institute, a research unit at the University of Minnesota.[29] Benjamin F. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1941 after completing 50 years of service.[30] Hormel's production increased to aid in World War II and 65% of its products were purchased by the U.S. government by 1945.[31] Founder George A. Hormel died in 1946 in California where he had lived in retirement. He is buried in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery. Jay C. then became chairman of the board, H.H. Corey became president, and R.F. Gray became vice-president.[32] Hormel acquired the Fremont Packing Company in 1947.[33]
1950s[edit]
In 1953, it acquired the Tobin Packing Company of Fort Dodge. Also in 1953, distribution centers were opened in San Francisco, Seattle and Beaumont and the company's first non-continental plant opened in Honolulu.[34] Jay C. Hormel died on August 30, 1954, and Corey was named chairman of the board and R.F. Gray was elected president the following year.[35] During Gray's tenure as president, the company greatly expanded its international business through arrangements with companies in Ireland, The UK, Canada and Venezuela. Stagg Chili is a brand of chili con carne sold in cans or boxes that was launched in 1956. In 1959, Hormel was the first meatpacker to receive the Seal of Approval of the American Humane Society for its practice of anesthetizing animals before slaughter.[36]
1960s[edit]

Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961[37] and Cure 81 hams were introduced in 1963.[38] In 1962, Hormel constructed a 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) sausage manufacturing building in Austin and discontinued the slaughter of calves and lambs.[39] Also in 1963, Hormel acquired the Queen City Packing Company plant in Springfield, Missouri, and the Ottawa Meat Packing Company plant in Miami, Oklahoma. New plants were also constructed in Chattanooga and Los Angeles and the plants in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Fresno and Houston were remodeled or expanded. In 1964, the Hormel Corporate Offices were opened just to the north of Interstate 90 in Austin. Gray replaced Corey as chairman of the board upon the latter's retirement in 1965, and M.B. Thompson became president.[40] During Thompson's tenure (1965–1969) a dry sausage plant was built in Algona and distribution centers were built in San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. In 1967, the company, in cooperation with the National Merit Scholarship Program, started a college scholarship program for the children of Hormel employees. Partial scholarships were awarded through this program on the basis of the student's test scores, academic records, financial need, and school and community involvement. A separate building to house the growing research and development department was built northwest of the corporate office in Austin in 1968. In 1969, Gray resigned from the company and Thompson replaced him as chairman (by this time the chairman was called the CEO) and I.J. Holton was named president.[41]
1970s[edit]
In 1970, a distribution plant was built in Albany, Georgia, and a dry sausage plant was built in Algona. In 1971, meat processing facilities and distribution centers were opened in both Dallas and Seattle.[41] That same year the company introduced its Matching Gifts program in which it offered to match the donation (up to $2,000) made by any employee to any accredited college or university. In 1972, Holton became CEO and distribution centers were opened in Orlando and Shreveport and a food service facility was built in Oklahoma City. A grocery products plant was opened in Beloit in 1973.[41] On this site the city now boasts the world's largest can of chili. Also in 1973, Hormel Foods became the first company in the meatpacking industry to introduce nutritional and ingredient labeling on meat products.[42] A frozen foods plant was opened in Fort Worth in 1974. A distribution plant was opened in Houston in 1975. In 1976, a slaughtering and processing plant was opened in Ottumwa, a dry sausage plant was opened in Knoxville, Iowa, and a grocery products canning facility was acquired in Stockton. A distribution plant was built in Fresno in 1978. A gelatin plant was opened in Davenport and groundbreaking for a new, one-story Austin plant in 1979.[43] That same year Richard Knowlton was elected as president, the first Austinian to hold that post since Jay Catherwood Hormel.[40]
1980s[edit]
Holton continued as CEO until 1981 and then this duty was also passed to Knowlton. The construction of the current Austin plant began in 1980, and the Knoxville and Ottumwa plants were expanded. The plants in Beloit, Los Angeles and Ottumwa were renovated and expanded.[44] The new Austin plant, a 1,300,000-square-foot (120,000 m2) facility, began production on May 24, 1982, and was dedicated on September 12, 1982.[45] Knowlton also became chairman of the board in 1984, while continuing to hold the titles of president and CEO. Not-So-Sloppy-Joe Sloppy Joe sauce made its debut in 1985.[46] In 1986, Hormel Foods acquired Jennie-O Foods[40] and also began an exclusive licensing arrangement to produce Chi-Chi's brand products.[47] The following year, Hormel Foods introduced the Top Shelf line of microwavable non-frozen products. The company added to their poultry offerings by purchasing Chicken by George, created by former Miss America Phyllis George, in 1988. That same year, Hormel Foods also introduced microwave bacon.[48] In mid-1984, Hormel introduced the Frank 'n Stuff brand of stuffed hot dogs.[46][49][50][51][52]
1985 strike[edit]
In August 1985, Hormel workers went on strike at the Hormel headquarters in Austin, Minnesota. In the early 1980s, recession impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which led smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained.[53] Workers had already labored under a wage freeze and dangerous working conditions, leading to many cases of repetitive strain injury. When management demanded a 23% wage cut from the workers they decided to begin the strike.[54] It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s. The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local P-9, led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized boycott of Hormel products.
After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, called in the National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. This brought protests against the governor, and the National Guard withdrew from Austin. The action had a greater effect on the UFCW international, which ousted the local P-9.
The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages.
The strike was chronicled in the film American Dream, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1990. A song about the strike, entitled "P-9" was written by Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum. The song can be found on their 1989 album Clam Dip & Other Delights.
The strike has also had a Harvard Business School Case written based on it (with assumed names), called "Adam Baxter Co./Local 190" which features multiple rounds of negotiations between unions and management.[55]
1990s[edit]
Hormel Foods celebrated 100 years of operation in 1991. In 1993, the name of the company was officially changed from Geo. A. Hormel & Company to Hormel Foods Corporation. That same year Knowlton retired and Joel W. Johnson became president and CEO. Production facilities were opened in Osceola, Iowa in 1996.
2000s[edit]




The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota


The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, was opened in 2001. That same year, Hormel Foods acquired The Turkey Store, the business was combined with Jennie-O Foods to form Jennie-O Turkey Store.[56] In 2004, Jennie-O Turkey Store launched its Jennie-O Turkey Store Oven Ready turkey. In 2004, Jeffrey M. Ettinger succeeded Johnson as company president and introduced the Billion Dollar Challenge, setting a goal for the company to generate $1 billion in sales from new products by the end of fiscal year 2009.[40] The same year Hormel Foods introduced the first nationally distributed all-natural line of meat products with Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, which utilizes high pressure processing technology.[57] Recent acquisitions by Hormel Foods include: Diamond Crystal Brands (2002),[58] Century Foods International (2003)[59] Clougherty Packing (Farmer John) (2004),[60] Lloyd’s Barbeque Company (2005),[61] Mark-Lynn Foods (2005), Arriba Foods (2005), Provena Foods (2006) and Burke Foods (2007).[62]
In 2004, five new varieties of the Stagg Chili brand were made available nationwide.[63]
In 2008, the company achieved the $1 billion sales goal of the Billion Dollar Challenge a year early and introduced a new challenge introduced to generate $2 billion in sales from new products by 2012.[64]
In 2008, animal rights organization PETA sent members to work undercover at a pig factory farm in Iowa to investigate allegations of animal rights abuses, then released a video record[65] showing workers treating the pigs cruelly and without regard for animal rights. The factory farm was owned by Natural Pork Production II LLP of Iowa until August 18, 2008, at which point ownership had transferred to MowMar LLP. Prior to this the farm was not a supplier to Hormel Foods. Hormel spokeswoman Julie Henderson Craven, who responded to the PETA video, called the videotaped abuses "completely unacceptable."[66] In their 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report, Hormel Foods stated that all suppliers are expected to comply with several welfare programs to ensure that the hogs purchased are treated humanely. Because of the investigation, several employees of the farm were fired and six individuals faced charges due to the abuse.[67]
In November 2008, an article in the New York Times, "SPAM Turns Serious and Hormel Turns Out More," detailed an overwhelming spike in the demand for SPAM, perhaps due to the flagging economy.[68] In July 2009, Hormel and Herdez del Fuerte created the joint venture MegaMex Foods to market and distribute Mexican food in the United States.[69] Brands included in the venture include Herdez, La Victoria, Chi Chi's, El Torito, Embasa, Wholly Guacamole, Del Fuerte, Dona Maria, Bufalo, and Don Miguel.[70]
2010s[edit]

On January 3, 2013, Hormel Foods announced it had purchased Skippy—the best-selling brand of peanut butter in China and the second-best-selling brand in the world—from Unilever for $700 million; the sale included Skippy's USA and China factories.[78]
The company also began to produce a brand of wrapped tortilla-like snacks dubbed REV. These wraps are essentially miniature tacos, available in several flavors such as pepperoni pizza, ham & cheese, peppered turkey, meat lovers pizza, Italian-style ham, along with several others.[79]
Hormel bought the CytoSport company in June 2014 for about US$450 million, including the Muscle Milk protein supplement brand.[80] In October of that year, Hormel Foods announced a partnership with the Cancer Nutrition Consortium, to provide cancer patients with nutritional offerings for their specific, individual needs during cancer treatment.[81]
In May 2015, Hormel revealed it would acquire meat processing firm Applegate Farms for around $775 million, expanding its range of natural and organic meat products.[82] The company also announced James P. Snee was elected to the position of president and chief operating officer in October 2015.[83] The company was named to the Human Resource Campaign Foundation's Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality in November.[84] In 2015, after an undercover investigation at a Minnesota processing plant, Hormel Foods announced it was bringing humane handling officers to the QPP facility to ensure compliance with its own animal welfare standards. It has also told QPP to provide extra training, enhance compliance oversight and increase third-party auditing. QPP announced plans to strengthen its video monitoring system and improve animal handling equipment.[85]
In 2016, Peak Rock Capital purchased the Diamond Crystal Brands Inc. unit, purchased by Hormel in 2002 for $155 million from Imperial Sugar.[86][87]
Jeffrey Ettinger retired as CEO, effective October 30, 2016. Ettinger remained Chairman of the Board.[1] President & COO James Snee assumed the role of CEO effective October 31, 2016.[1]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Hormel Foods released its first Citizenship Overview, formally reporting the company’s corporate responsibility initiatives in 2007.[88] The company has been included on the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for the last seven consecutive years.[89]
In 2008, Hormel Foods donated funds to The Hormel Institute, which dedicated an expansion to their cancer research facility.[90] The project renovated a building adding research facilities, including space to house the Blue Gene/L supercomputer. The Institute, located in Austin, MN, was the result of a partnership in 1942 between the Hormel Foundation, the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic.
In 2011, Hormel Foods introduced SPAMMY, a fortified, shelf-stable turkey spread to help address childhood malnutrition throughout the world. The company made an initial three-year commitment to deliver 1 million cans to in-need families in Guatemala.[91] In 2014, Hormel Foods announced promising results of the nutrition research portion of Project SPAMMY.[92] In 2015, SPAMMY became available for purchase under Title I for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) feeding programs and Title II for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs under the name fortified poultry-based spread (FPBS).[93]
In 2012, Hormel Foods announced its second set of environmental goals. The company surpassed the water reduction, packaging and solid waste minimization goals of its first set of five-year goals, which ended in 2011.[94] That same year, Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer, was named Responsible CEO of the Year by CR Magazine.[95]
In 2013, Hormel Foods received two AMI environmental achievement awards for the company’s expansion project at the Corporate Office and a water conservation project at Burke Marketing Corp.[96]
In 2015, Hormel Foods announced that it met its solid waste reduction goal six years early. The company's Corporate Responsibility report is available online at www.hormelfoods.com/csr and includes information related to the company’s sustainability performance in 2014.[97]
Allegations of animal abuse[edit]
In January 2016, Mercy For Animals released undercover footage of pigs being abused at a Hormel pork supplier. The undercover video shows piglets having their testicles ripped out and tails cut off without any anesthetic, piglets left to suffer from untreated illness or injuries, piglets with no room to move trampling each other in crowded hallways, and mother pigs crammed into filthy gestation crates unable to move.[98] In response, Hormel suspended its buying from the supplier.[99]

History[edit]
19th century[edit]




The building in which George A. Hormel started his business. Preserved at the Mower County Fairgrounds in Austin.


George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer. His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there, borrow $500, and open a meat business. Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail side. The two dissolved their partnership in 1891 so that Hormel could start a complete meat packing operation on his own.[8] He opened George A. Hormel & Co. in the northeast part of Austin in an old creamery building on the Cedar River. To make ends meet in those early days, Hormel continued to trade in hides, eggs, wool, and poultry. Joining George in November 1891 was his youngest brother, Benjamin, age 14. By the end of 1891 Hormel employed six men and had slaughtered and sold 610 head of livestock. By 1893, the increased use of refrigerator cars and greater efficiency had forced smaller businesses to collapse. Two additional Hormel brothers, Herman and John, joined the business that same year, and together they processed 1,532 hogs. The remaining members of the Hormel family moved to Austin in 1895 and joined the growing business. George turned to full-time management in 1899, and focused on increasing production.[9]
1900s[edit]
In 1901, the plant was expanded and the business was incorporated. The first directors were A.L. Eberhart and the four Hormel brothers: George, Herman, John and Ben. In 1903 George decided to add a three-story hog-kill, a two-story beef-kill, an annex, an engine room, a machine shop and a casing production department.[10] The name Dairy Brand was registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1903. In the first decade of the 20th century distribution centers were opened in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Birmingham. George Hormel visited England in 1905 and started exporting products soon after.[11]
1910s[edit]
By 1910, Hormel products were routinely appearing in national magazines.[12] That same year the company developed a procedure to recycle its waste water by daily evaporating up to 9,000 gallons of water, leaving a syrupy liquid which was dried to produce a commercial fertilizer. In 1915 Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar Cervelat, Holsteiner and Noxall Salami.[13] That same year Hormel bought Alderson's Mill and began selling Hormel Peerless Minnesota flour nationwide.[14] Hormel joined the World War I effort, George's son Jay C. went into military service[15] and by the end of the war, exports accounted for 33% of the company's yearly volume.[16]
1920s[edit]




The Hormel plant circa 1920


In 1921, when Jay Hormel returned from service in WWI, he uncovered that assistant controller Cy Thomson had embezzled $1,187,000 from the company over the previous ten years. The embezzlement scandal provided George Hormel with additional incentive to fortify his company. He did so by arranging for more reliable capital management, by dismissing unproductive employees, and by continuing to develop new products.[17] In 1926, the company introduced Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham, America's first canned ham and it added chicken to its line in 1928.[18] Jay C. Hormel became company president in 1929 and that same year the plant was expanded again to include eight new structures and the main office was tripled in size.[19] In the late 1920s and early 1930s sales branches opened in Houston, Beaumont, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Newark, Los Angeles, Vicksburg, and Nuevo Laredo (Mexico).[20]
1930s[edit]
In 1931, Jay C. instituted the Annual Wage Plan: under this plan, employees were paid weekly and they were guaranteed 52 weeks' notice before termination of employment.[21] He also introduced incentive pay, profit sharing and pension plans to the company.[22] Later that year a slaughtering plant was constructed in Mitchell, South Dakota, and in 1933, a cattle slaughtering plant was finished in Austin. John G. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1933 following 40 years of service.[23] Dinty Moore beef stew was introduced in 1935 first created by Ryen "Gunns" Gunning and Hormel Chili and Spam soon followed in 1936 and 1937 respectively.[24] In 1938, Jay C. Hormel introduced the "Joint Savings Plan" which allowed employees to share in the proceeds of the company.[25] By the late-1930s, full-page, four color ads were routinely appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Hormel ads also were featured on the radio program The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.
In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation's first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO).[26][27][28]
The 1930s also saw the establishment of the Hormel & Co. refrigerator car line, with an initial roster of 125 units.
1940s[edit]




The Hormel obelisk in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery.


After reaching sales of $75 million in 1941, George and Jay established The Hormel Foundation to provide perpetual independence of the company, act as trustees of the family trusts and to start and fund The Hormel Institute, a research unit at the University of Minnesota.[29] Benjamin F. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1941 after completing 50 years of service.[30] Hormel's production increased to aid in World War II and 65% of its products were purchased by the U.S. government by 1945.[31] Founder George A. Hormel died in 1946 in California where he had lived in retirement. He is buried in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery. Jay C. then became chairman of the board, H.H. Corey became president, and R.F. Gray became vice-president.[32] Hormel acquired the Fremont Packing Company in 1947.[33]
1950s[edit]
In 1953, it acquired the Tobin Packing Company of Fort Dodge. Also in 1953, distribution centers were opened in San Francisco, Seattle and Beaumont and the company's first non-continental plant opened in Honolulu.[34] Jay C. Hormel died on August 30, 1954, and Corey was named chairman of the board and R.F. Gray was elected president the following year.[35] During Gray's tenure as president, the company greatly expanded its international business through arrangements with companies in Ireland, The UK, Canada and Venezuela. Stagg Chili is a brand of chili con carne sold in cans or boxes that was launched in 1956. In 1959, Hormel was the first meatpacker to receive the Seal of Approval of the American Humane Society for its practice of anesthetizing animals before slaughter.[36]
1960s[edit]

Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961[37] and Cure 81 hams were introduced in 1963.[38] In 1962, Hormel constructed a 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) sausage manufacturing building in Austin and discontinued the slaughter of calves and lambs.[39] Also in 1963, Hormel acquired the Queen City Packing Company plant in Springfield, Missouri, and the Ottawa Meat Packing Company plant in Miami, Oklahoma. New plants were also constructed in Chattanooga and Los Angeles and the plants in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Fresno and Houston were remodeled or expanded. In 1964, the Hormel Corporate Offices were opened just to the north of Interstate 90 in Austin. Gray replaced Corey as chairman of the board upon the latter's retirement in 1965, and M.B. Thompson became president.[40] During Thompson's tenure (1965–1969) a dry sausage plant was built in Algona and distribution centers were built in San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. In 1967, the company, in cooperation with the National Merit Scholarship Program, started a college scholarship program for the children of Hormel employees. Partial scholarships were awarded through this program on the basis of the student's test scores, academic records, financial need, and school and community involvement. A separate building to house the growing research and development department was built northwest of the corporate office in Austin in 1968. In 1969, Gray resigned from the company and Thompson replaced him as chairman (by this time the chairman was called the CEO) and I.J. Holton was named president.[41]
1970s[edit]
In 1970, a distribution plant was built in Albany, Georgia, and a dry sausage plant was built in Algona. In 1971, meat processing facilities and distribution centers were opened in both Dallas and Seattle.[41] That same year the company introduced its Matching Gifts program in which it offered to match the donation (up to $2,000) made by any employee to any accredited college or university. In 1972, Holton became CEO and distribution centers were opened in Orlando and Shreveport and a food service facility was built in Oklahoma City. A grocery products plant was opened in Beloit in 1973.[41] On this site the city now boasts the world's largest can of chili. Also in 1973, Hormel Foods became the first company in the meatpacking industry to introduce nutritional and ingredient labeling on meat products.[42] A frozen foods plant was opened in Fort Worth in 1974. A distribution plant was opened in Houston in 1975. In 1976, a slaughtering and processing plant was opened in Ottumwa, a dry sausage plant was opened in Knoxville, Iowa, and a grocery products canning facility was acquired in Stockton. A distribution plant was built in Fresno in 1978. A gelatin plant was opened in Davenport and groundbreaking for a new, one-story Austin plant in 1979.[43] That same year Richard Knowlton was elected as president, the first Austinian to hold that post since Jay Catherwood Hormel.[40]
1980s[edit]
Holton continued as CEO until 1981 and then this duty was also passed to Knowlton. The construction of the current Austin plant began in 1980, and the Knoxville and Ottumwa plants were expanded. The plants in Beloit, Los Angeles and Ottumwa were renovated and expanded.[44] The new Austin plant, a 1,300,000-square-foot (120,000 m2) facility, began production on May 24, 1982, and was dedicated on September 12, 1982.[45] Knowlton also became chairman of the board in 1984, while continuing to hold the titles of president and CEO. Not-So-Sloppy-Joe Sloppy Joe sauce made its debut in 1985.[46] In 1986, Hormel Foods acquired Jennie-O Foods[40] and also began an exclusive licensing arrangement to produce Chi-Chi's brand products.[47] The following year, Hormel Foods introduced the Top Shelf line of microwavable non-frozen products. The company added to their poultry offerings by purchasing Chicken by George, created by former Miss America Phyllis George, in 1988. That same year, Hormel Foods also introduced microwave bacon.[48] In mid-1984, Hormel introduced the Frank 'n Stuff brand of stuffed hot dogs.[46][49][50][51][52]
1985 strike[edit]
In August 1985, Hormel workers went on strike at the Hormel headquarters in Austin, Minnesota. In the early 1980s, recession impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which led smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained.[53] Workers had already labored under a wage freeze and dangerous working conditions, leading to many cases of repetitive strain injury. When management demanded a 23% wage cut from the workers they decided to begin the strike.[54] It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s. The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local P-9, led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized boycott of Hormel products.
After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, called in the National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. This brought protests against the governor, and the National Guard withdrew from Austin. The action had a greater effect on the UFCW international, which ousted the local P-9.
The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages.
The strike was chronicled in the film American Dream, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1990. A song about the strike, entitled "P-9" was written by Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum. The song can be found on their 1989 album Clam Dip & Other Delights.
The strike has also had a Harvard Business School Case written based on it (with assumed names), called "Adam Baxter Co./Local 190" which features multiple rounds of negotiations between unions and management.[55]
1990s[edit]
Hormel Foods celebrated 100 years of operation in 1991. In 1993, the name of the company was officially changed from Geo. A. Hormel & Company to Hormel Foods Corporation. That same year Knowlton retired and Joel W. Johnson became president and CEO. Production facilities were opened in Osceola, Iowa in 1996.
2000s[edit]




The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota


The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, was opened in 2001. That same year, Hormel Foods acquired The Turkey Store, the business was combined with Jennie-O Foods to form Jennie-O Turkey Store.[56] In 2004, Jennie-O Turkey Store launched its Jennie-O Turkey Store Oven Ready turkey. In 2004, Jeffrey M. Ettinger succeeded Johnson as company president and introduced the Billion Dollar Challenge, setting a goal for the company to generate $1 billion in sales from new products by the end of fiscal year 2009.[40] The same year Hormel Foods introduced the first nationally distributed all-natural line of meat products with Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, which utilizes high pressure processing technology.[57] Recent acquisitions by Hormel Foods include: Diamond Crystal Brands (2002),[58] Century Foods International (2003)[59] Clougherty Packing (Farmer John) (2004),[60] Lloyd’s Barbeque Company (2005),[61] Mark-Lynn Foods (2005), Arriba Foods (2005), Provena Foods (2006) and Burke Foods (2007).[62]
In 2004, five new varieties of the Stagg Chili brand were made available nationwide.[63]
In 2008, the company achieved the $1 billion sales goal of the Billion Dollar Challenge a year early and introduced a new challenge introduced to generate $2 billion in sales from new products by 2012.[64]
In 2008, animal rights organization PETA sent members to work undercover at a pig factory farm in Iowa to investigate allegations of animal rights abuses, then released a video record[65] showing workers treating the pigs cruelly and without regard for animal rights. The factory farm was owned by Natural Pork Production II LLP of Iowa until August 18, 2008, at which point ownership had transferred to MowMar LLP. Prior to this the farm was not a supplier to Hormel Foods. Hormel spokeswoman Julie Henderson Craven, who responded to the PETA video, called the videotaped abuses "completely unacceptable."[66] In their 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report, Hormel Foods stated that all suppliers are expected to comply with several welfare programs to ensure that the hogs purchased are treated humanely. Because of the investigation, several employees of the farm were fired and six individuals faced charges due to the abuse.[67]
In November 2008, an article in the New York Times, "SPAM Turns Serious and Hormel Turns Out More," detailed an overwhelming spike in the demand for SPAM, perhaps due to the flagging economy.[68] In July 2009, Hormel and Herdez del Fuerte created the joint venture MegaMex Foods to market and distribute Mexican food in the United States.[69] Brands included in the venture include Herdez, La Victoria, Chi Chi's, El Torito, Embasa, Wholly Guacamole, Del Fuerte, Dona Maria, Bufalo, and Don Miguel.[70]
2010s[edit]




Skippy peanut butter, a brand acquired in 2013.


In 2010 Hormel Foods opened Progressive Processing, Inc, in Dubuque, Iowa. The facility was awarded the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold status, one of the first manufacturing facilities to be LEED certified.[71] MegaMex Foods, a joint venture of Hormel Foods and Herdez del Fuerte, acquired Don Miguel Foods, a leading provider of branded frozen and fresh authentic Mexican flavored appetizers, snacks and handheld items.[72]
In 2011, Hormel Foods announced a 2 for 1 stock split.[73] Hormel Foods also acquired Fresherized Foods, makers of Wholly Guacamole, as part of their MegaMex joint venture.[74]
In 2012, the Spam brand celebrated its 75th anniversary with the introduction of Sir Can A-Lot™, its first ever campaign spokescharacter.[75] Hormel Foods also announced that it met its ambitious “Go for $2B by 2012” goal by achieving $2 billion in total sales from new products created since 2000 by the end of fiscal year 2012.[76] The company's next challenge "The $3B by 2016 Challenge," to achieve $3 billion in total sales of products created since 2000 by the end of 2016 is currently underway.[77]
On January 3, 2013, Hormel Foods announced it had purchased Skippy—the best-selling brand of peanut butter in China and the second-best-selling brand in the world—from Unilever for $700 million; the sale included Skippy's USA and China factories.[78]
The company also began to produce a brand of wrapped tortilla-like snacks dubbed REV. These wraps are essentially miniature tacos, available in several flavors such as pepperoni pizza, ham & cheese, peppered turkey, meat lovers pizza, Italian-style ham, along with several others.[79]
Hormel bought the CytoSport company in June 2014 for about US$450 million, including the Muscle Milk protein supplement brand.[80] In October of that year, Hormel Foods announced a partnership with the Cancer Nutrition Consortium, to provide cancer patients with nutritional offerings for their specific, individual needs during cancer treatment.[81]
In May 2015, Hormel revealed it would acquire meat processing firm Applegate Farms for around $775 million, expanding its range of natural and organic meat products.[82] The company also announced James P. Snee was elected to the position of president and chief operating officer in October 2015.[83] The company was named to the Human Resource Campaign Foundation's Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality in November.[84] In 2015, after an undercover investigation at a Minnesota processing plant, Hormel Foods announced it was bringing humane handling officers to the QPP facility to ensure compliance with its own animal welfare standards. It has also told QPP to provide extra training, enhance compliance oversight and increase third-party auditing. QPP announced plans to strengthen its video monitoring system and improve animal handling equipment.[85]
In 2016, Peak Rock Capital purchased the Diamond Crystal Brands Inc. unit, purchased by Hormel in 2002 for $155 million from Imperial Sugar.[86][87]
Jeffrey Ettinger retired as CEO, effective October 30, 2016. Ettinger remained Chairman of the Board.[1] President & COO James Snee assumed the role of CEO effective October 31, 2016.[1]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Hormel Foods released its first Citizenship Overview, formally reporting the company’s corporate responsibility initiatives in 2007.[88] The company has been included on the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for the last seven consecutive years.[89]
In 2008, Hormel Foods donated funds to The Hormel Institute, which dedicated an expansion to their cancer research facility.[90] The project renovated a building adding research facilities, including space to house the Blue Gene/L supercomputer. The Institute, located in Austin, MN, was the result of a partnership in 1942 between the Hormel Foundation, the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic.
In 2011, Hormel Foods introduced SPAMMY, a fortified, shelf-stable turkey spread to help address childhood malnutrition throughout the world. The company made an initial three-year commitment to deliver 1 million cans to in-need families in Guatemala.[91] In 2014, Hormel Foods announced promising results of the nutrition research portion of Project SPAMMY.[92] In 2015, SPAMMY became available for purchase under Title I for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) feeding programs and Title II for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs under the name fortified poultry-based spread (FPBS).[93]
In 2012, Hormel Foods announced its second set of environmental goals. The company surpassed the water reduction, packaging and solid waste minimization goals of its first set of five-year goals, which ended in 2011.[94] That same year, Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer, was named Responsible CEO of the Year by CR Magazine.[95]
In 2013, Hormel Foods received two AMI environmental achievement awards for the company’s expansion project at the Corporate Office and a water conservation project at Burke Marketing Corp.[96]
In 2015, Hormel Foods announced that it met its solid waste reduction goal six years early. The company's Corporate Responsibility report is available online at www.hormelfoods.com/csr and includes information related to the company’s sustainability performance in 2014.[97]
Allegations of animal abuse[edit]
In January 2016, Mercy For Animals released undercover footage of pigs being abused at a Hormel pork supplier. The undercover video shows piglets having their testicles ripped out and tails cut off without any anesthetic, piglets left to suffer from untreated illness or injuries, piglets with no room to move trampling each other in crowded hallways, and mother pigs crammed into filthy gestation crates unable to move.[98] In response, Hormel suspended its buying from the supplier.[99]

History[edit]
19th century[edit]




The building in which George A. Hormel started his business. Preserved at the Mower County Fairgrounds in Austin.


George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer. His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there, borrow $500, and open a meat business. Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail side. The two dissolved their partnership in 1891 so that Hormel could start a complete meat packing operation on his own.[8] He opened George A. Hormel & Co. in the northeast part of Austin in an old creamery building on the Cedar River. To make ends meet in those early days, Hormel continued to trade in hides, eggs, wool, and poultry. Joining George in November 1891 was his youngest brother, Benjamin, age 14. By the end of 1891 Hormel employed six men and had slaughtered and sold 610 head of livestock. By 1893, the increased use of refrigerator cars and greater efficiency had forced smaller businesses to collapse. Two additional Hormel brothers, Herman and John, joined the business that same year, and together they processed 1,532 hogs. The remaining members of the Hormel family moved to Austin in 1895 and joined the growing business. George turned to full-time management in 1899, and focused on increasing production.[9]
1900s[edit]
In 1901, the plant was expanded and the business was incorporated. The first directors were A.L. Eberhart and the four Hormel brothers: George, Herman, John and Ben. In 1903 George decided to add a three-story hog-kill, a two-story beef-kill, an annex, an engine room, a machine shop and a casing production department.[10] The name Dairy Brand was registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1903. In the first decade of the 20th century distribution centers were opened in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Birmingham. George Hormel visited England in 1905 and started exporting products soon after.[11]
1910s[edit]
By 1910, Hormel products were routinely appearing in national magazines.[12] That same year the company developed a procedure to recycle its waste water by daily evaporating up to 9,000 gallons of water, leaving a syrupy liquid which was dried to produce a commercial fertilizer. In 1915 Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar Cervelat, Holsteiner and Noxall Salami.[13] That same year Hormel bought Alderson's Mill and began selling Hormel Peerless Minnesota flour nationwide.[14] Hormel joined the World War I effort, George's son Jay C. went into military service[15] and by the end of the war, exports accounted for 33% of the company's yearly volume.[16]
1920s[edit]




The Hormel plant circa 1920


In 1921, when Jay Hormel returned from service in WWI, he uncovered that assistant controller Cy Thomson had embezzled $1,187,000 from the company over the previous ten years. The embezzlement scandal provided George Hormel with additional incentive to fortify his company. He did so by arranging for more reliable capital management, by dismissing unproductive employees, and by continuing to develop new products.[17] In 1926, the company introduced Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham, America's first canned ham and it added chicken to its line in 1928.[18] Jay C. Hormel became company president in 1929 and that same year the plant was expanded again to include eight new structures and the main office was tripled in size.[19] In the late 1920s and early 1930s sales branches opened in Houston, Beaumont, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Newark, Los Angeles, Vicksburg, and Nuevo Laredo (Mexico).[20]
1930s[edit]
In 1931, Jay C. instituted the Annual Wage Plan: under this plan, employees were paid weekly and they were guaranteed 52 weeks' notice before termination of employment.[21] He also introduced incentive pay, profit sharing and pension plans to the company.[22] Later that year a slaughtering plant was constructed in Mitchell, South Dakota, and in 1933, a cattle slaughtering plant was finished in Austin. John G. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1933 following 40 years of service.[23] Dinty Moore beef stew was introduced in 1935 first created by Ryen "Gunns" Gunning and Hormel Chili and Spam soon followed in 1936 and 1937 respectively.[24] In 1938, Jay C. Hormel introduced the "Joint Savings Plan" which allowed employees to share in the proceeds of the company.[25] By the late-1930s, full-page, four color ads were routinely appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Hormel ads also were featured on the radio program The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.
In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation's first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO).[26][27][28]
The 1930s also saw the establishment of the Hormel & Co. refrigerator car line, with an initial roster of 125 units.
1940s[edit]




The Hormel obelisk in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery.


After reaching sales of $75 million in 1941, George and Jay established The Hormel Foundation to provide perpetual independence of the company, act as trustees of the family trusts and to start and fund The Hormel Institute, a research unit at the University of Minnesota.[29] Benjamin F. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1941 after completing 50 years of service.[30] Hormel's production increased to aid in World War II and 65% of its products were purchased by the U.S. government by 1945.[31] Founder George A. Hormel died in 1946 in California where he had lived in retirement. He is buried in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery. Jay C. then became chairman of the board, H.H. Corey became president, and R.F. Gray became vice-president.[32] Hormel acquired the Fremont Packing Company in 1947.[33]
1950s[edit]
In 1953, it acquired the Tobin Packing Company of Fort Dodge. Also in 1953, distribution centers were opened in San Francisco, Seattle and Beaumont and the company's first non-continental plant opened in Honolulu.[34] Jay C. Hormel died on August 30, 1954, and Corey was named chairman of the board and R.F. Gray was elected president the following year.[35] During Gray's tenure as president, the company greatly expanded its international business through arrangements with companies in Ireland, The UK, Canada and Venezuela. Stagg Chili is a brand of chili con carne sold in cans or boxes that was launched in 1956. In 1959, Hormel was the first meatpacker to receive the Seal of Approval of the American Humane Society for its practice of anesthetizing animals before slaughter.[36]
1960s[edit]

Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961[37] and Cure 81 hams were introduced in 1963.[38] In 1962, Hormel constructed a 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) sausage manufacturing building in Austin and discontinued the slaughter of calves and lambs.[39] Also in 1963, Hormel acquired the Queen City Packing Company plant in Springfield, Missouri, and the Ottawa Meat Packing Company plant in Miami, Oklahoma. New plants were also constructed in Chattanooga and Los Angeles and the plants in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Fresno and Houston were remodeled or expanded. In 1964, the Hormel Corporate Offices were opened just to the north of Interstate 90 in Austin. Gray replaced Corey as chairman of the board upon the latter's retirement in 1965, and M.B. Thompson became president.[40] During Thompson's tenure (1965–1969) a dry sausage plant was built in Algona and distribution centers were built in San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. In 1967, the company, in cooperation with the National Merit Scholarship Program, started a college scholarship program for the children of Hormel employees. Partial scholarships were awarded through this program on the basis of the student's test scores, academic records, financial need, and school and community involvement. A separate building to house the growing research and development department was built northwest of the corporate office in Austin in 1968. In 1969, Gray resigned from the company and Thompson replaced him as chairman (by this time the chairman was called the CEO) and I.J. Holton was named president.[41]
1970s[edit]
In 1970, a distribution plant was built in Albany, Georgia, and a dry sausage plant was built in Algona. In 1971, meat processing facilities and distribution centers were opened in both Dallas and Seattle.[41] That same year the company introduced its Matching Gifts program in which it offered to match the donation (up to $2,000) made by any employee to any accredited college or university. In 1972, Holton became CEO and distribution centers were opened in Orlando and Shreveport and a food service facility was built in Oklahoma City. A grocery products plant was opened in Beloit in 1973.[41] On this site the city now boasts the world's largest can of chili. Also in 1973, Hormel Foods became the first company in the meatpacking industry to introduce nutritional and ingredient labeling on meat products.[42] A frozen foods plant was opened in Fort Worth in 1974. A distribution plant was opened in Houston in 1975. In 1976, a slaughtering and processing plant was opened in Ottumwa, a dry sausage plant was opened in Knoxville, Iowa, and a grocery products canning facility was acquired in Stockton. A distribution plant was built in Fresno in 1978. A gelatin plant was opened in Davenport and groundbreaking for a new, one-story Austin plant in 1979.[43] That same year Richard Knowlton was elected as president, the first Austinian to hold that post since Jay Catherwood Hormel.[40]
1980s[edit]
Holton continued as CEO until 1981 and then this duty was also passed to Knowlton. The construction of the current Austin plant began in 1980, and the Knoxville and Ottumwa plants were expanded. The plants in Beloit, Los Angeles and Ottumwa were renovated and expanded.[44] The new Austin plant, a 1,300,000-square-foot (120,000 m2) facility, began production on May 24, 1982, and was dedicated on September 12, 1982.[45] Knowlton also became chairman of the board in 1984, while continuing to hold the titles of president and CEO. Not-So-Sloppy-Joe Sloppy Joe sauce made its debut in 1985.[46] In 1986, Hormel Foods acquired Jennie-O Foods[40] and also began an exclusive licensing arrangement to produce Chi-Chi's brand products.[47] The following year, Hormel Foods introduced the Top Shelf line of microwavable non-frozen products. The company added to their poultry offerings by purchasing Chicken by George, created by former Miss America Phyllis George, in 1988. That same year, Hormel Foods also introduced microwave bacon.[48] In mid-1984, Hormel introduced the Frank 'n Stuff brand of stuffed hot dogs.[46][49][50][51][52]
1985 strike[edit]
In August 1985, Hormel workers went on strike at the Hormel headquarters in Austin, Minnesota. In the early 1980s, recession impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which led smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained.[53] Workers had already labored under a wage freeze and dangerous working conditions, leading to many cases of repetitive strain injury. When management demanded a 23% wage cut from the workers they decided to begin the strike.[54] It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s. The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local P-9, led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized boycott of Hormel products.
After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, called in the National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. This brought protests against the governor, and the National Guard withdrew from Austin. The action had a greater effect on the UFCW international, which ousted the local P-9.
The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages.
The strike was chronicled in the film American Dream, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1990. A song about the strike, entitled "P-9" was written by Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum. The song can be found on their 1989 album Clam Dip & Other Delights.
The strike has also had a Harvard Business School Case written based on it (with assumed names), called "Adam Baxter Co./Local 190" which features multiple rounds of negotiations between unions and management.[55]
1990s[edit]
Hormel Foods celebrated 100 years of operation in 1991. In 1993, the name of the company was officially changed from Geo. A. Hormel & Company to Hormel Foods Corporation. That same year Knowlton retired and Joel W. Johnson became president and CEO. Production facilities were opened in Osceola, Iowa in 1996.
2000s[edit]




The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota


The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, was opened in 2001. That same year, Hormel Foods acquired The Turkey Store, the business was combined with Jennie-O Foods to form Jennie-O Turkey Store.[56] In 2004, Jennie-O Turkey Store launched its Jennie-O Turkey Store Oven Ready turkey. In 2004, Jeffrey M. Ettinger succeeded Johnson as company president and introduced the Billion Dollar Challenge, setting a goal for the company to generate $1 billion in sales from new products by the end of fiscal year 2009.[40] The same year Hormel Foods introduced the first nationally distributed all-natural line of meat products with Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, which utilizes high pressure processing technology.[57] Recent acquisitions by Hormel Foods include: Diamond Crystal Brands (2002),[58] Century Foods International (2003)[59] Clougherty Packing (Farmer John) (2004),[60] Lloyd’s Barbeque Company (2005),[61] Mark-Lynn Foods (2005), Arriba Foods (2005), Provena Foods (2006) and Burke Foods (2007).[62]
In 2004, five new varieties of the Stagg Chili brand were made available nationwide.[63]
In 2008, the company achieved the $1 billion sales goal of the Billion Dollar Challenge a year early and introduced a new challenge introduced to generate $2 billion in sales from new products by 2012.[64]
In 2008, animal rights organization PETA sent members to work undercover at a pig factory farm in Iowa to investigate allegations of animal rights abuses, then released a video record[65] showing workers treating the pigs cruelly and without regard for animal rights. The factory farm was owned by Natural Pork Production II LLP of Iowa until August 18, 2008, at which point ownership had transferred to MowMar LLP. Prior to this the farm was not a supplier to Hormel Foods. Hormel spokeswoman Julie Henderson Craven, who responded to the PETA video, called the videotaped abuses "completely unacceptable."[66] In their 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report, Hormel Foods stated that all suppliers are expected to comply with several welfare programs to ensure that the hogs purchased are treated humanely. Because of the investigation, several employees of the farm were fired and six individuals faced charges due to the abuse.[67]
In November 2008, an article in the New York Times, "SPAM Turns Serious and Hormel Turns Out More," detailed an overwhelming spike in the demand for SPAM, perhaps due to the flagging economy.[68] In July 2009, Hormel and Herdez del Fuerte created the joint venture MegaMex Foods to market and distribute Mexican food in the United States.[69] Brands included in the venture include Herdez, La Victoria, Chi Chi's, El Torito, Embasa, Wholly Guacamole, Del Fuerte, Dona Maria, Bufalo, and Don Miguel.[70]
2010s[edit]




Skippy peanut butter, a brand acquired in 2013.


In 2010 Hormel Foods opened Progressive Processing, Inc, in Dubuque, Iowa. The facility was awarded the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold status, one of the first manufacturing facilities to be LEED certified.[71] MegaMex Foods, a joint venture of Hormel Foods and Herdez del Fuerte, acquired Don Miguel Foods, a leading provider of branded frozen and fresh authentic Mexican flavored appetizers, snacks and handheld items.[72]
In 2011, Hormel Foods announced a 2 for 1 stock split.[73] Hormel Foods also acquired Fresherized Foods, makers of Wholly Guacamole, as part of their MegaMex joint venture.[74]
In 2012, the Spam brand celebrated its 75th anniversary with the introduction of Sir Can A-Lot™, its first ever campaign spokescharacter.[75] Hormel Foods also announced that it met its ambitious “Go for $2B by 2012” goal by achieving $2 billion in total sales from new products created since 2000 by the end of fiscal year 2012.[76] The company's next challenge "The $3B by 2016 Challenge," to achieve $3 billion in total sales of products created since 2000 by the end of 2016 is currently underway.[77]
On January 3, 2013, Hormel Foods announced it had purchased Skippy—the best-selling brand of peanut butter in China and the second-best-selling brand in the world—from Unilever for $700 million; the sale included Skippy's USA and China factories.[78]
The company also began to produce a brand of wrapped tortilla-like snacks dubbed REV. These wraps are essentially miniature tacos, available in several flavors such as pepperoni pizza, ham & cheese, peppered turkey, meat lovers pizza, Italian-style ham, along with several others.[79]
Hormel bought the CytoSport company in June 2014 for about US$450 million, including the Muscle Milk protein supplement brand.[80] In October of that year, Hormel Foods announced a partnership with the Cancer Nutrition Consortium, to provide cancer patients with nutritional offerings for their specific, individual needs during cancer treatment.[81]
In May 2015, Hormel revealed it would acquire meat processing firm Applegate Farms for around $775 million, expanding its range of natural and organic meat products.[82] The company also announced James P. Snee was elected to the position of president and chief operating officer in October 2015.[83] The company was named to the Human Resource Campaign Foundation's Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality in November.[84] In 2015, after an undercover investigation at a Minnesota processing plant, Hormel Foods announced it was bringing humane handling officers to the QPP facility to ensure compliance with its own animal welfare standards. It has also told QPP to provide extra training, enhance compliance oversight and increase third-party auditing. QPP announced plans to strengthen its video monitoring system and improve animal handling equipment.[85]
In 2016, Peak Rock Capital purchased the Diamond Crystal Brands Inc. unit, purchased by Hormel in 2002 for $155 million from Imperial Sugar.[86][87]
Jeffrey Ettinger retired as CEO, effective October 30, 2016. Ettinger remained Chairman of the Board.[1] President & COO James Snee assumed the role of CEO effective October 31, 2016.[1]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Hormel Foods released its first Citizenship Overview, formally reporting the company’s corporate responsibility initiatives in 2007.[88] The company has been included on the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for the last seven consecutive years.[89]
In 2008, Hormel Foods donated funds to The Hormel Institute, which dedicated an expansion to their cancer research facility.[90] The project renovated a building adding research facilities, including space to house the Blue Gene/L supercomputer. The Institute, located in Austin, MN, was the result of a partnership in 1942 between the Hormel Foundation, the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic.
In 2011, Hormel Foods introduced SPAMMY, a fortified, shelf-stable turkey spread to help address childhood malnutrition throughout the world. The company made an initial three-year commitment to deliver 1 million cans to in-need families in Guatemala.[91] In 2014, Hormel Foods announced promising results of the nutrition research portion of Project SPAMMY.[92] In 2015, SPAMMY became available for purchase under Title I for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) feeding programs and Title II for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs under the name fortified poultry-based spread (FPBS).[93]
In 2012, Hormel Foods announced its second set of environmental goals. The company surpassed the water reduction, packaging and solid waste minimization goals of its first set of five-year goals, which ended in 2011.[94] That same year, Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer, was named Responsible CEO of the Year by CR Magazine.[95]
In 2013, Hormel Foods received two AMI environmental achievement awards for the company’s expansion project at the Corporate Office and a water conservation project at Burke Marketing Corp.[96]
In 2015, Hormel Foods announced that it met its solid waste reduction goal six years early. The company's Corporate Responsibility report is available online at www.hormelfoods.com/csr and includes information related to the company’s sustainability performance in 2014.[97]
Allegations of animal abuse[edit]
In January 2016, Mercy For Animals released undercover footage of pigs being abused at a Hormel pork supplier. The undercover video shows piglets having their testicles ripped out and tails cut off without any anesthetic, piglets left to suffer from untreated illness or injuries, piglets with no room to move trampling each other in crowded hallways, and mother pigs crammed into filthy gestation crates unable to move.[98] In response, Hormel suspended its buying from the supplier.[99]

History[edit]
19th century[edit]




The building in which George A. Hormel started his business. Preserved at the Mower County Fairgrounds in Austin.


George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer. His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there, borrow $500, and open a meat business. Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail side. The two dissolved their partnership in 1891 so that Hormel could start a complete meat packing operation on his own.[8] He opened George A. Hormel & Co. in the northeast part of Austin in an old creamery building on the Cedar River. To make ends meet in those early days, Hormel continued to trade in hides, eggs, wool, and poultry. Joining George in November 1891 was his youngest brother, Benjamin, age 14. By the end of 1891 Hormel employed six men and had slaughtered and sold 610 head of livestock. By 1893, the increased use of refrigerator cars and greater efficiency had forced smaller businesses to collapse. Two additional Hormel brothers, Herman and John, joined the business that same year, and together they processed 1,532 hogs. The remaining members of the Hormel family moved to Austin in 1895 and joined the growing business. George turned to full-time management in 1899, and focused on increasing production.[9]
1900s[edit]
In 1901, the plant was expanded and the business was incorporated. The first directors were A.L. Eberhart and the four Hormel brothers: George, Herman, John and Ben. In 1903 George decided to add a three-story hog-kill, a two-story beef-kill, an annex, an engine room, a machine shop and a casing production department.[10] The name Dairy Brand was registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1903. In the first decade of the 20th century distribution centers were opened in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Birmingham. George Hormel visited England in 1905 and started exporting products soon after.[11]
1910s[edit]
By 1910, Hormel products were routinely appearing in national magazines.[12] That same year the company developed a procedure to recycle its waste water by daily evaporating up to 9,000 gallons of water, leaving a syrupy liquid which was dried to produce a commercial fertilizer. In 1915 Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar Cervelat, Holsteiner and Noxall Salami.[13] That same year Hormel bought Alderson's Mill and began selling Hormel Peerless Minnesota flour nationwide.[14] Hormel joined the World War I effort, George's son Jay C. went into military service[15] and by the end of the war, exports accounted for 33% of the company's yearly volume.[16]
1920s[edit]




The Hormel plant circa 1920


In 1921, when Jay Hormel returned from service in WWI, he uncovered that assistant controller Cy Thomson had embezzled $1,187,000 from the company over the previous ten years. The embezzlement scandal provided George Hormel with additional incentive to fortify his company. He did so by arranging for more reliable capital management, by dismissing unproductive employees, and by continuing to develop new products.[17] In 1926, the company introduced Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham, America's first canned ham and it added chicken to its line in 1928.[18] Jay C. Hormel became company president in 1929 and that same year the plant was expanded again to include eight new structures and the main office was tripled in size.[19] In the late 1920s and early 1930s sales branches opened in Houston, Beaumont, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Newark, Los Angeles, Vicksburg, and Nuevo Laredo (Mexico).[20]
1930s[edit]
In 1931, Jay C. instituted the Annual Wage Plan: under this plan, employees were paid weekly and they were guaranteed 52 weeks' notice before termination of employment.[21] He also introduced incentive pay, profit sharing and pension plans to the company.[22] Later that year a slaughtering plant was constructed in Mitchell, South Dakota, and in 1933, a cattle slaughtering plant was finished in Austin. John G. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1933 following 40 years of service.[23] Dinty Moore beef stew was introduced in 1935 first created by Ryen "Gunns" Gunning and Hormel Chili and Spam soon followed in 1936 and 1937 respectively.[24] In 1938, Jay C. Hormel introduced the "Joint Savings Plan" which allowed employees to share in the proceeds of the company.[25] By the late-1930s, full-page, four color ads were routinely appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Hormel ads also were featured on the radio program The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.
In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation's first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO).[26][27][28]
The 1930s also saw the establishment of the Hormel & Co. refrigerator car line, with an initial roster of 125 units.
1940s[edit]

After reaching sales of $75 million in 1941, George and Jay established The Hormel Foundation to provide perpetual independence of the company, act as trustees of the family trusts and to start and fund The Hormel Institute, a research unit at the University of Minnesota.[29] Benjamin F. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1941 after completing 50 years of service.[30] Hormel's production increased to aid in World War II and 65% of its products were purchased by the U.S. government by 1945.[31] Founder George A. Hormel died in 1946 in California where he had lived in retirement. He is buried in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery. Jay C. then became chairman of the board, H.H. Corey became president, and R.F. Gray became vice-president.[32] Hormel acquired the Fremont Packing Company in 1947.[33]
1950s[edit]
In 1953, it acquired the Tobin Packing Company of Fort Dodge. Also in 1953, distribution centers were opened in San Francisco, Seattle and Beaumont and the company's first non-continental plant opened in Honolulu.[34] Jay C. Hormel died on August 30, 1954, and Corey was named chairman of the board and R.F. Gray was elected president the following year.[35] During Gray's tenure as president, the company greatly expanded its international business through arrangements with companies in Ireland, The UK, Canada and Venezuela. Stagg Chili is a brand of chili con carne sold in cans or boxes that was launched in 1956. In 1959, Hormel was the first meatpacker to receive the Seal of Approval of the American Humane Society for its practice of anesthetizing animals before slaughter.[36]

Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961[37] and Cure 81 hams were introduced in 1963.[38] In 1962, Hormel constructed a 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) sausage manufacturing building in Austin and discontinued the slaughter of calves and lambs.[39] Also in 1963, Hormel acquired the Queen City Packing Company plant in Springfield, Missouri, and the Ottawa Meat Packing Company plant in Miami, Oklahoma. New plants were also constructed in Chattanooga and Los Angeles and the plants in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Fresno and Houston were remodeled or expanded. In 1964, the Hormel Corporate Offices were opened just to the north of Interstate 90 in Austin. Gray replaced Corey as chairman of the board upon the latter's retirement in 1965, and M.B. Thompson became president.[40] During Thompson's tenure (1965–1969) a dry sausage plant was built in Algona and distribution centers were built in San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. In 1967, the company, in cooperation with the National Merit Scholarship Program, started a college scholarship program for the children of Hormel employees. Partial scholarships were awarded through this program on the basis of the student's test scores, academic records, financial need, and school and community involvement. A separate building to house the growing research and development department was built northwest of the corporate office in Austin in 1968. In 1969, Gray resigned from the company and Thompson replaced him as chairman (by this time the chairman was called the CEO) and I.J. Holton was named president.[41]
1970s[edit]
In 1970, a distribution plant was built in Albany, Georgia, and a dry sausage plant was built in Algona. In 1971, meat processing facilities and distribution centers were opened in both Dallas and Seattle.[41] That same year the company introduced its Matching Gifts program in which it offered to match the donation (up to $2,000) made by any employee to any accredited college or university. In 1972, Holton became CEO and distribution centers were opened in Orlando and Shreveport and a food service facility was built in Oklahoma City. A grocery products plant was opened in Beloit in 1973.[41] On this site the city now boasts the world's largest can of chili. Also in 1973, Hormel Foods became the first company in the meatpacking industry to introduce nutritional and ingredient labeling on meat products.[42] A frozen foods plant was opened in Fort Worth in 1974. A distribution plant was opened in Houston in 1975. In 1976, a slaughtering and processing plant was opened in Ottumwa, a dry sausage plant was opened in Knoxville, Iowa, and a grocery products canning facility was acquired in Stockton. A distribution plant was built in Fresno in 1978. A gelatin plant was opened in Davenport and groundbreaking for a new, one-story Austin plant in 1979.[43] That same year Richard Knowlton was elected as president, the first Austinian to hold that post since Jay Catherwood Hormel.[40]
1980s[edit]
Holton continued as CEO until 1981 and then this duty was also passed to Knowlton. The construction of the current Austin plant began in 1980, and the Knoxville and Ottumwa plants were expanded. The plants in Beloit, Los Angeles and Ottumwa were renovated and expanded.[44] The new Austin plant, a 1,300,000-square-foot (120,000 m2) facility, began production on May 24, 1982, and was dedicated on September 12, 1982.[45] Knowlton also became chairman of the board in 1984, while continuing to hold the titles of president and CEO. Not-So-Sloppy-Joe Sloppy Joe sauce made its debut in 1985.[46] In 1986, Hormel Foods acquired Jennie-O Foods[40] and also began an exclusive licensing arrangement to produce Chi-Chi's brand products.[47] The following year, Hormel Foods introduced the Top Shelf line of microwavable non-frozen products. The company added to their poultry offerings by purchasing Chicken by George, created by former Miss America Phyllis George, in 1988. That same year, Hormel Foods also introduced microwave bacon.[48] In mid-1984, Hormel introduced the Frank 'n Stuff brand of stuffed hot dogs.[46][49][50][51][52]
1985 strike[edit]
In August 1985, Hormel workers went on strike at the Hormel headquarters in Austin, Minnesota. In the early 1980s, recession impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which led smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained.[53] Workers had already labored under a wage freeze and dangerous working conditions, leading to many cases of repetitive strain injury. When management demanded a 23% wage cut from the workers they decided to begin the strike.[54] It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s. The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local P-9, led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized boycott of Hormel products.
After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, called in the National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. This brought protests against the governor, and the National Guard withdrew from Austin. The action had a greater effect on the UFCW international, which ousted the local P-9.
The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages.
The strike was chronicled in the film American Dream, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1990. A song about the strike, entitled "P-9" was written by Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum. The song can be found on their 1989 album Clam Dip & Other Delights.
The strike has also had a Harvard Business School Case written based on it (with assumed names), called "Adam Baxter Co./Local 190" which features multiple rounds of negotiations between unions and management.[55]
1990s[edit]
Hormel Foods celebrated 100 years of operation in 1991. In 1993, the name of the company was officially changed from Geo. A. Hormel & Company to Hormel Foods Corporation. That same year Knowlton retired and Joel W. Johnson became president and CEO. Production facilities were opened in Osceola, Iowa in 1996.
2000s[edit]




The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota


The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, was opened in 2001. That same year, Hormel Foods acquired The Turkey Store, the business was combined with Jennie-O Foods to form Jennie-O Turkey Store.[56] In 2004, Jennie-O Turkey Store launched its Jennie-O Turkey Store Oven Ready turkey. In 2004, Jeffrey M. Ettinger succeeded Johnson as company president and introduced the Billion Dollar Challenge, setting a goal for the company to generate $1 billion in sales from new products by the end of fiscal year 2009.[40] The same year Hormel Foods introduced the first nationally distributed all-natural line of meat products with Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, which utilizes high pressure processing technology.[57] Recent acquisitions by Hormel Foods include: Diamond Crystal Brands (2002),[58] Century Foods International (2003)[59] Clougherty Packing (Farmer John) (2004),[60] Lloyd’s Barbeque Company (2005),[61] Mark-Lynn Foods (2005), Arriba Foods (2005), Provena Foods (2006) and Burke Foods (2007).[62]
In 2004, five new varieties of the Stagg Chili brand were made available nationwide.[63]
In 2008, the company achieved the $1 billion sales goal of the Billion Dollar Challenge a year early and introduced a new challenge introduced to generate $2 billion in sales from new products by 2012.[64]
In 2008, animal rights organization PETA sent members to work undercover at a pig factory farm in Iowa to investigate allegations of animal rights abuses, then released a video record[65] showing workers treating the pigs cruelly and without regard for animal rights. The factory farm was owned by Natural Pork Production II LLP of Iowa until August 18, 2008, at which point ownership had transferred to MowMar LLP. Prior to this the farm was not a supplier to Hormel Foods. Hormel spokeswoman Julie Henderson Craven, who responded to the PETA video, called the videotaped abuses "completely unacceptable."[66] In their 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report, Hormel Foods stated that all suppliers are expected to comply with several welfare programs to ensure that the hogs purchased are treated humanely. Because of the investigation, several employees of the farm were fired and six individuals faced charges due to the abuse.[67]
In November 2008, an article in the New York Times, "SPAM Turns Serious and Hormel Turns Out More," detailed an overwhelming spike in the demand for SPAM, perhaps due to the flagging economy.[68] In July 2009, Hormel and Herdez del Fuerte created the joint venture MegaMex Foods to market and distribute Mexican food in the United States.[69] Brands included in the venture include Herdez, La Victoria, Chi Chi's, El Torito, Embasa, Wholly Guacamole, Del Fuerte, Dona Maria, Bufalo, and Don Miguel.[70]
2010s[edit]

In 2010 Hormel Foods opened Progressive Processing, Inc, in Dubuque, Iowa. The facility was awarded the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold status, one of the first manufacturing facilities to be LEED certified.[71] MegaMex Foods, a joint venture of Hormel Foods and Herdez del Fuerte, acquired Don Miguel Foods, a leading provider of branded frozen and fresh authentic Mexican flavored appetizers, snacks and handheld items.[72]
In 2011, Hormel Foods announced a 2 for 1 stock split.[73] Hormel Foods also acquired Fresherized Foods, makers of Wholly Guacamole, as part of their MegaMex joint venture.[74]
In 2012, the Spam brand celebrated its 75th anniversary with the introduction of Sir Can A-Lot™, its first ever campaign spokescharacter.[75] Hormel Foods also announced that it met its ambitious “Go for $2B by 2012” goal by achieving $2 billion in total sales from new products created since 2000 by the end of fiscal year 2012.[76] The company's next challenge "The $3B by 2016 Challenge," to achieve $3 billion in total sales of products created since 2000 by the end of 2016 is currently underway.[77]
On January 3, 2013, Hormel Foods announced it had purchased Skippy—the best-selling brand of peanut butter in China and the second-best-selling brand in the world—from Unilever for $700 million; the sale included Skippy's USA and China factories.[78]
The company also began to produce a brand of wrapped tortilla-like snacks dubbed REV. These wraps are essentially miniature tacos, available in several flavors such as pepperoni pizza, ham & cheese, peppered turkey, meat lovers pizza, Italian-style ham, along with several others.[79]
Hormel bought the CytoSport company in June 2014 for about US$450 million, including the Muscle Milk protein supplement brand.[80] In October of that year, Hormel Foods announced a partnership with the Cancer Nutrition Consortium, to provide cancer patients with nutritional offerings for their specific, individual needs during cancer treatment.[81]
In May 2015, Hormel revealed it would acquire meat processing firm Applegate Farms for around $775 million, expanding its range of natural and organic meat products.[82] The company also announced James P. Snee was elected to the position of president and chief operating officer in October 2015.[83] The company was named to the Human Resource Campaign Foundation's Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality in November.[84] In 2015, after an undercover investigation at a Minnesota processing plant, Hormel Foods announced it was bringing humane handling officers to the QPP facility to ensure compliance with its own animal welfare standards. It has also told QPP to provide extra training, enhance compliance oversight and increase third-party auditing. QPP announced plans to strengthen its video monitoring system and improve animal handling equipment.[85]
In 2016, Peak Rock Capital purchased the Diamond Crystal Brands Inc. unit, purchased by Hormel in 2002 for $155 million from Imperial Sugar.[86][87]
Jeffrey Ettinger retired as CEO, effective October 30, 2016. Ettinger remained Chairman of the Board.[1] President & COO James Snee assumed the role of CEO effective October 31, 2016.[1]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Hormel Foods released its first Citizenship Overview, formally reporting the company’s corporate responsibility initiatives in 2007.[88] The company has been included on the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for the last seven consecutive years.[89]
In 2008, Hormel Foods donated funds to The Hormel Institute, which dedicated an expansion to their cancer research facility.[90] The project renovated a building adding research facilities, including space to house the Blue Gene/L supercomputer. The Institute, located in Austin, MN, was the result of a partnership in 1942 between the Hormel Foundation, the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic.
In 2011, Hormel Foods introduced SPAMMY, a fortified, shelf-stable turkey spread to help address childhood malnutrition throughout the world. The company made an initial three-year commitment to deliver 1 million cans to in-need families in Guatemala.[91] In 2014, Hormel Foods announced promising results of the nutrition research portion of Project SPAMMY.[92] In 2015, SPAMMY became available for purchase under Title I for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) feeding programs and Title II for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs under the name fortified poultry-based spread (FPBS).[93]
In 2012, Hormel Foods announced its second set of environmental goals. The company surpassed the water reduction, packaging and solid waste minimization goals of its first set of five-year goals, which ended in 2011.[94] That same year, Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer, was named Responsible CEO of the Year by CR Magazine.[95]
In 2013, Hormel Foods received two AMI environmental achievement awards for the company’s expansion project at the Corporate Office and a water conservation project at Burke Marketing Corp.[96]
In 2015, Hormel Foods announced that it met its solid waste reduction goal six years early. The company's Corporate Responsibility report is available online at www.hormelfoods.com/csr and includes information related to the company’s sustainability performance in 2014.[97]
Allegations of animal abuse[edit]
In January 2016, Mercy For Animals released undercover footage of pigs being abused at a Hormel pork supplier. The undercover video shows piglets having their testicles ripped out and tails cut off without any anesthetic, piglets left to suffer from untreated illness or injuries, piglets with no room to move trampling each other in crowded hallways, and mother pigs crammed into filthy gestation crates unable to move.[98] In response, Hormel suspended its buying from the supplier.[99]

History[edit]
19th century[edit]




The building in which George A. Hormel started his business. Preserved at the Mower County Fairgrounds in Austin.


George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer. His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there, borrow $500, and open a meat business. Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail side. The two dissolved their partnership in 1891 so that Hormel could start a complete meat packing operation on his own.[8] He opened George A. Hormel & Co. in the northeast part of Austin in an old creamery building on the Cedar River. To make ends meet in those early days, Hormel continued to trade in hides, eggs, wool, and poultry. Joining George in November 1891 was his youngest brother, Benjamin, age 14. By the end of 1891 Hormel employed six men and had slaughtered and sold 610 head of livestock. By 1893, the increased use of refrigerator cars and greater efficiency had forced smaller businesses to collapse. Two additional Hormel brothers, Herman and John, joined the business that same year, and together they processed 1,532 hogs. The remaining members of the Hormel family moved to Austin in 1895 and joined the growing business. George turned to full-time management in 1899, and focused on increasing production.[9]
1900s[edit]
In 1901, the plant was expanded and the business was incorporated. The first directors were A.L. Eberhart and the four Hormel brothers: George, Herman, John and Ben. In 1903 George decided to add a three-story hog-kill, a two-story beef-kill, an annex, an engine room, a machine shop and a casing production department.[10] The name Dairy Brand was registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1903. In the first decade of the 20th century distribution centers were opened in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Birmingham. George Hormel visited England in 1905 and started exporting products soon after.[11]
1910s[edit]
By 1910, Hormel products were routinely appearing in national magazines.[12] That same year the company developed a procedure to recycle its waste water by daily evaporating up to 9,000 gallons of water, leaving a syrupy liquid which was dried to produce a commercial fertilizer. In 1915 Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar Cervelat, Holsteiner and Noxall Salami.[13] That same year Hormel bought Alderson's Mill and began selling Hormel Peerless Minnesota flour nationwide.[14] Hormel joined the World War I effort, George's son Jay C. went into military service[15] and by the end of the war, exports accounted for 33% of the company's yearly volume.[16]
1920s[edit]




The Hormel plant circa 1920


In 1921, when Jay Hormel returned from service in WWI, he uncovered that assistant controller Cy Thomson had embezzled $1,187,000 from the company over the previous ten years. The embezzlement scandal provided George Hormel with additional incentive to fortify his company. He did so by arranging for more reliable capital management, by dismissing unproductive employees, and by continuing to develop new products.[17] In 1926, the company introduced Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham, America's first canned ham and it added chicken to its line in 1928.[18] Jay C. Hormel became company president in 1929 and that same year the plant was expanded again to include eight new structures and the main office was tripled in size.[19] In the late 1920s and early 1930s sales branches opened in Houston, Beaumont, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Newark, Los Angeles, Vicksburg, and Nuevo Laredo (Mexico).[20]
1930s[edit]
In 1931, Jay C. instituted the Annual Wage Plan: under this plan, employees were paid weekly and they were guaranteed 52 weeks' notice before termination of employment.[21] He also introduced incentive pay, profit sharing and pension plans to the company.[22] Later that year a slaughtering plant was constructed in Mitchell, South Dakota, and in 1933, a cattle slaughtering plant was finished in Austin. John G. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1933 following 40 years of service.[23] Dinty Moore beef stew was introduced in 1935 first created by Ryen "Gunns" Gunning and Hormel Chili and Spam soon followed in 1936 and 1937 respectively.[24] In 1938, Jay C. Hormel introduced the "Joint Savings Plan" which allowed employees to share in the proceeds of the company.[25] By the late-1930s, full-page, four color ads were routinely appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Hormel ads also were featured on the radio program The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.
In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation's first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO).[26][27][28]
The 1930s also saw the establishment of the Hormel & Co. refrigerator car line, with an initial roster of 125 units.
1940s[edit]




The Hormel obelisk in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery.


After reaching sales of $75 million in 1941, George and Jay established The Hormel Foundation to provide perpetual independence of the company, act as trustees of the family trusts and to start and fund The Hormel Institute, a research unit at the University of Minnesota.[29] Benjamin F. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1941 after completing 50 years of service.[30] Hormel's production increased to aid in World War II and 65% of its products were purchased by the U.S. government by 1945.[31] Founder George A. Hormel died in 1946 in California where he had lived in retirement. He is buried in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery. Jay C. then became chairman of the board, H.H. Corey became president, and R.F. Gray became vice-president.[32] Hormel acquired the Fremont Packing Company in 1947.[33]
1950s[edit]
In 1953, it acquired the Tobin Packing Company of Fort Dodge. Also in 1953, distribution centers were opened in San Francisco, Seattle and Beaumont and the company's first non-continental plant opened in Honolulu.[34] Jay C. Hormel died on August 30, 1954, and Corey was named chairman of the board and R.F. Gray was elected president the following year.[35] During Gray's tenure as president, the company greatly expanded its international business through arrangements with companies in Ireland, The UK, Canada and Venezuela. Stagg Chili is a brand of chili con carne sold in cans or boxes that was launched in 1956. In 1959, Hormel was the first meatpacker to receive the Seal of Approval of the American Humane Society for its practice of anesthetizing animals before slaughter.[36]
1960s[edit]

Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961[37] and Cure 81 hams were introduced in 1963.[38] In 1962, Hormel constructed a 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) sausage manufacturing building in Austin and discontinued the slaughter of calves and lambs.[39] Also in 1963, Hormel acquired the Queen City Packing Company plant in Springfield, Missouri, and the Ottawa Meat Packing Company plant in Miami, Oklahoma. New plants were also constructed in Chattanooga and Los Angeles and the plants in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Fresno and Houston were remodeled or expanded. In 1964, the Hormel Corporate Offices were opened just to the north of Interstate 90 in Austin. Gray replaced Corey as chairman of the board upon the latter's retirement in 1965, and M.B. Thompson became president.[40] During Thompson's tenure (1965–1969) a dry sausage plant was built in Algona and distribution centers were built in San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. In 1967, the company, in cooperation with the National Merit Scholarship Program, started a college scholarship program for the children of Hormel employees. Partial scholarships were awarded through this program on the basis of the student's test scores, academic records, financial need, and school and community involvement. A separate building to house the growing research and development department was built northwest of the corporate office in Austin in 1968. In 1969, Gray resigned from the company and Thompson replaced him as chairman (by this time the chairman was called the CEO) and I.J. Holton was named president.[41]
1970s[edit]
In 1970, a distribution plant was built in Albany, Georgia, and a dry sausage plant was built in Algona. In 1971, meat processing facilities and distribution centers were opened in both Dallas and Seattle.[41] That same year the company introduced its Matching Gifts program in which it offered to match the donation (up to $2,000) made by any employee to any accredited college or university. In 1972, Holton became CEO and distribution centers were opened in Orlando and Shreveport and a food service facility was built in Oklahoma City. A grocery products plant was opened in Beloit in 1973.[41] On this site the city now boasts the world's largest can of chili. Also in 1973, Hormel Foods became the first company in the meatpacking industry to introduce nutritional and ingredient labeling on meat products.[42] A frozen foods plant was opened in Fort Worth in 1974. A distribution plant was opened in Houston in 1975. In 1976, a slaughtering and processing plant was opened in Ottumwa, a dry sausage plant was opened in Knoxville, Iowa, and a grocery products canning facility was acquired in Stockton. A distribution plant was built in Fresno in 1978. A gelatin plant was opened in Davenport and groundbreaking for a new, one-story Austin plant in 1979.[43] That same year Richard Knowlton was elected as president, the first Austinian to hold that post since Jay Catherwood Hormel.[40]
1980s[edit]
Holton continued as CEO until 1981 and then this duty was also passed to Knowlton. The construction of the current Austin plant began in 1980, and the Knoxville and Ottumwa plants were expanded. The plants in Beloit, Los Angeles and Ottumwa were renovated and expanded.[44] The new Austin plant, a 1,300,000-square-foot (120,000 m2) facility, began production on May 24, 1982, and was dedicated on September 12, 1982.[45] Knowlton also became chairman of the board in 1984, while continuing to hold the titles of president and CEO. Not-So-Sloppy-Joe Sloppy Joe sauce made its debut in 1985.[46] In 1986, Hormel Foods acquired Jennie-O Foods[40] and also began an exclusive licensing arrangement to produce Chi-Chi's brand products.[47] The following year, Hormel Foods introduced the Top Shelf line of microwavable non-frozen products. The company added to their poultry offerings by purchasing Chicken by George, created by former Miss America Phyllis George, in 1988. That same year, Hormel Foods also introduced microwave bacon.[48] In mid-1984, Hormel introduced the Frank 'n Stuff brand of stuffed hot dogs.[46][49][50][51][52]
1985 strike[edit]
In August 1985, Hormel workers went on strike at the Hormel headquarters in Austin, Minnesota. In the early 1980s, recession impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which led smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained.[53] Workers had already labored under a wage freeze and dangerous working conditions, leading to many cases of repetitive strain injury. When management demanded a 23% wage cut from the workers they decided to begin the strike.[54] It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s. The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local P-9, led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized boycott of Hormel products.
After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, called in the National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. This brought protests against the governor, and the National Guard withdrew from Austin. The action had a greater effect on the UFCW international, which ousted the local P-9.
The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages.
The strike was chronicled in the film American Dream, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1990. A song about the strike, entitled "P-9" was written by Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum. The song can be found on their 1989 album Clam Dip & Other Delights.
The strike has also had a Harvard Business School Case written based on it (with assumed names), called "Adam Baxter Co./Local 190" which features multiple rounds of negotiations between unions and management.[55]
1990s[edit]
Hormel Foods celebrated 100 years of operation in 1991. In 1993, the name of the company was officially changed from Geo. A. Hormel & Company to Hormel Foods Corporation. That same year Knowlton retired and Joel W. Johnson became president and CEO. Production facilities were opened in Osceola, Iowa in 1996.
2000s[edit]




The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota


The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, was opened in 2001. That same year, Hormel Foods acquired The Turkey Store, the business was combined with Jennie-O Foods to form Jennie-O Turkey Store.[56] In 2004, Jennie-O Turkey Store launched its Jennie-O Turkey Store Oven Ready turkey. In 2004, Jeffrey M. Ettinger succeeded Johnson as company president and introduced the Billion Dollar Challenge, setting a goal for the company to generate $1 billion in sales from new products by the end of fiscal year 2009.[40] The same year Hormel Foods introduced the first nationally distributed all-natural line of meat products with Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, which utilizes high pressure processing technology.[57] Recent acquisitions by Hormel Foods include: Diamond Crystal Brands (2002),[58] Century Foods International (2003)[59] Clougherty Packing (Farmer John) (2004),[60] Lloyd’s Barbeque Company (2005),[61] Mark-Lynn Foods (2005), Arriba Foods (2005), Provena Foods (2006) and Burke Foods (2007).[62]
In 2004, five new varieties of the Stagg Chili brand were made available nationwide.[63]
In 2008, the company achieved the $1 billion sales goal of the Billion Dollar Challenge a year early and introduced a new challenge introduced to generate $2 billion in sales from new products by 2012.[64]
In 2008, animal rights organization PETA sent members to work undercover at a pig factory farm in Iowa to investigate allegations of animal rights abuses, then released a video record[65] showing workers treating the pigs cruelly and without regard for animal rights. The factory farm was owned by Natural Pork Production II LLP of Iowa until August 18, 2008, at which point ownership had transferred to MowMar LLP. Prior to this the farm was not a supplier to Hormel Foods. Hormel spokeswoman Julie Henderson Craven, who responded to the PETA video, called the videotaped abuses "completely unacceptable."[66] In their 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report, Hormel Foods stated that all suppliers are expected to comply with several welfare programs to ensure that the hogs purchased are treated humanely. Because of the investigation, several employees of the farm were fired and six individuals faced charges due to the abuse.[67]
In November 2008, an article in the New York Times, "SPAM Turns Serious and Hormel Turns Out More," detailed an overwhelming spike in the demand for SPAM, perhaps due to the flagging economy.[68] In July 2009, Hormel and Herdez del Fuerte created the joint venture MegaMex Foods to market and distribute Mexican food in the United States.[69] Brands included in the venture include Herdez, La Victoria, Chi Chi's, El Torito, Embasa, Wholly Guacamole, Del Fuerte, Dona Maria, Bufalo, and Don Miguel.[70]
2010s[edit]




Skippy peanut butter, a brand acquired in 2013.


In 2010 Hormel Foods opened Progressive Processing, Inc, in Dubuque, Iowa. The facility was awarded the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold status, one of the first manufacturing facilities to be LEED certified.[71] MegaMex Foods, a joint venture of Hormel Foods and Herdez del Fuerte, acquired Don Miguel Foods, a leading provider of branded frozen and fresh authentic Mexican flavored appetizers, snacks and handheld items.[72]
In 2011, Hormel Foods announced a 2 for 1 stock split.[73] Hormel Foods also acquired Fresherized Foods, makers of Wholly Guacamole, as part of their MegaMex joint venture.[74]
In 2012, the Spam brand celebrated its 75th anniversary with the introduction of Sir Can A-Lot™, its first ever campaign spokescharacter.[75] Hormel Foods also announced that it met its ambitious “Go for $2B by 2012” goal by achieving $2 billion in total sales from new products created since 2000 by the end of fiscal year 2012.[76] The company's next challenge "The $3B by 2016 Challenge," to achieve $3 billion in total sales of products created since 2000 by the end of 2016 is currently underway.[77]
On January 3, 2013, Hormel Foods announced it had purchased Skippy—the best-selling brand of peanut butter in China and the second-best-selling brand in the world—from Unilever for $700 million; the sale included Skippy's USA and China factories.[78]
The company also began to produce a brand of wrapped tortilla-like snacks dubbed REV. These wraps are essentially miniature tacos, available in several flavors such as pepperoni pizza, ham & cheese, peppered turkey, meat lovers pizza, Italian-style ham, along with several others.[79]
Hormel bought the CytoSport company in June 2014 for about US$450 million, including the Muscle Milk protein supplement brand.[80] In October of that year, Hormel Foods announced a partnership with the Cancer Nutrition Consortium, to provide cancer patients with nutritional offerings for their specific, individual needs during cancer treatment.[81]
In May 2015, Hormel revealed it would acquire meat processing firm Applegate Farms for around $775 million, expanding its range of natural and organic meat products.[82] The company also announced James P. Snee was elected to the position of president and chief operating officer in October 2015.[83] The company was named to the Human Resource Campaign Foundation's Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality in November.[84] In 2015, after an undercover investigation at a Minnesota processing plant, Hormel Foods announced it was bringing humane handling officers to the QPP facility to ensure compliance with its own animal welfare standards. It has also told QPP to provide extra training, enhance compliance oversight and increase third-party auditing. QPP announced plans to strengthen its video monitoring system and improve animal handling equipment.[85]
In 2016, Peak Rock Capital purchased the Diamond Crystal Brands Inc. unit, purchased by Hormel in 2002 for $155 million from Imperial Sugar.[86][87]
Jeffrey Ettinger retired as CEO, effective October 30, 2016. Ettinger remained Chairman of the Board.[1] President & COO James Snee assumed the role of CEO effective October 31, 2016.[1]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Hormel Foods released its first Citizenship Overview, formally reporting the company’s corporate responsibility initiatives in 2007.[88] The company has been included on the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for the last seven consecutive years.[89]
In 2008, Hormel Foods donated funds to The Hormel Institute, which dedicated an expansion to their cancer research facility.[90] The project renovated a building adding research facilities, including space to house the Blue Gene/L supercomputer. The Institute, located in Austin, MN, was the result of a partnership in 1942 between the Hormel Foundation, the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic.
In 2011, Hormel Foods introduced SPAMMY, a fortified, shelf-stable turkey spread to help address childhood malnutrition throughout the world. The company made an initial three-year commitment to deliver 1 million cans to in-need families in Guatemala.[91] In 2014, Hormel Foods announced promising results of the nutrition research portion of Project SPAMMY.[92] In 2015, SPAMMY became available for purchase under Title I for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) feeding programs and Title II for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs under the name fortified poultry-based spread (FPBS).[93]
In 2012, Hormel Foods announced its second set of environmental goals. The company surpassed the water reduction, packaging and solid waste minimization goals of its first set of five-year goals, which ended in 2011.[94] That same year, Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer, was named Responsible CEO of the Year by CR Magazine.[95]
In 2013, Hormel Foods received two AMI environmental achievement awards for the company’s expansion project at the Corporate Office and a water conservation project at Burke Marketing Corp.[96]
In 2015, Hormel Foods announced that it met its solid waste reduction goal six years early. The company's Corporate Responsibility report is available online at www.hormelfoods.com/csr and includes information related to the company’s sustainability performance in 2014.[97]
Allegations of animal abuse[edit]
In January 2016, Mercy For Animals released undercover footage of pigs being abused at a Hormel pork supplier. The undercover video shows piglets having their testicles ripped out and tails cut off without any anesthetic, piglets left to suffer from untreated illness or injuries, piglets with no room to move trampling each other in crowded hallways, and mother pigs crammed into filthy gestation crates unable to move.[98] In response, Hormel suspended its buying from the supplier.[99]

History[edit]
19th century[edit]




The building in which George A. Hormel started his business. Preserved at the Mower County Fairgrounds in Austin.


George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer. His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there, borrow $500, and open a meat business. Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail side. The two dissolved their partnership in 1891 so that Hormel could start a complete meat packing operation on his own.[8] He opened George A. Hormel & Co. in the northeast part of Austin in an old creamery building on the Cedar River. To make ends meet in those early days, Hormel continued to trade in hides, eggs, wool, and poultry. Joining George in November 1891 was his youngest brother, Benjamin, age 14. By the end of 1891 Hormel employed six men and had slaughtered and sold 610 head of livestock. By 1893, the increased use of refrigerator cars and greater efficiency had forced smaller businesses to collapse. Two additional Hormel brothers, Herman and John, joined the business that same year, and together they processed 1,532 hogs. The remaining members of the Hormel family moved to Austin in 1895 and joined the growing business. George turned to full-time management in 1899, and focused on increasing production.[9]
1900s[edit]
In 1901, the plant was expanded and the business was incorporated. The first directors were A.L. Eberhart and the four Hormel brothers: George, Herman, John and Ben. In 1903 George decided to add a three-story hog-kill, a two-story beef-kill, an annex, an engine room, a machine shop and a casing production department.[10] The name Dairy Brand was registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1903. In the first decade of the 20th century distribution centers were opened in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Birmingham. George Hormel visited England in 1905 and started exporting products soon after.[11]
1910s[edit]
By 1910, Hormel products were routinely appearing in national magazines.[12] That same year the company developed a procedure to recycle its waste water by daily evaporating up to 9,000 gallons of water, leaving a syrupy liquid which was dried to produce a commercial fertilizer. In 1915 Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar Cervelat, Holsteiner and Noxall Salami.[13] That same year Hormel bought Alderson's Mill and began selling Hormel Peerless Minnesota flour nationwide.[14] Hormel joined the World War I effort, George's son Jay C. went into military service[15] and by the end of the war, exports accounted for 33% of the company's yearly volume.[16]
1920s[edit]




The Hormel plant circa 1920


In 1921, when Jay Hormel returned from service in WWI, he uncovered that assistant controller Cy Thomson had embezzled $1,187,000 from the company over the previous ten years. The embezzlement scandal provided George Hormel with additional incentive to fortify his company. He did so by arranging for more reliable capital management, by dismissing unproductive employees, and by continuing to develop new products.[17] In 1926, the company introduced Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham, America's first canned ham and it added chicken to its line in 1928.[18] Jay C. Hormel became company president in 1929 and that same year the plant was expanded again to include eight new structures and the main office was tripled in size.[19] In the late 1920s and early 1930s sales branches opened in Houston, Beaumont, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Newark, Los Angeles, Vicksburg, and Nuevo Laredo (Mexico).[20]
1930s[edit]
In 1931, Jay C. instituted the Annual Wage Plan: under this plan, employees were paid weekly and they were guaranteed 52 weeks' notice before termination of employment.[21] He also introduced incentive pay, profit sharing and pension plans to the company.[22] Later that year a slaughtering plant was constructed in Mitchell, South Dakota, and in 1933, a cattle slaughtering plant was finished in Austin. John G. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1933 following 40 years of service.[23] Dinty Moore beef stew was introduced in 1935 first created by Ryen "Gunns" Gunning and Hormel Chili and Spam soon followed in 1936 and 1937 respectively.[24] In 1938, Jay C. Hormel introduced the "Joint Savings Plan" which allowed employees to share in the proceeds of the company.[25] By the late-1930s, full-page, four color ads were routinely appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Hormel ads also were featured on the radio program The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.
In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation's first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO).[26][27][28]
The 1930s also saw the establishment of the Hormel & Co. refrigerator car line, with an initial roster of 125 units.
1940s[edit]




The Hormel obelisk in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery.


After reaching sales of $75 million in 1941, George and Jay established The Hormel Foundation to provide perpetual independence of the company, act as trustees of the family trusts and to start and fund The Hormel Institute, a research unit at the University of Minnesota.[29] Benjamin F. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1941 after completing 50 years of service.[30] Hormel's production increased to aid in World War II and 65% of its products were purchased by the U.S. government by 1945.[31] Founder George A. Hormel died in 1946 in California where he had lived in retirement. He is buried in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery. Jay C. then became chairman of the board, H.H. Corey became president, and R.F. Gray became vice-president.[32] Hormel acquired the Fremont Packing Company in 1947.[33]
1950s[edit]
In 1953, it acquired the Tobin Packing Company of Fort Dodge. Also in 1953, distribution centers were opened in San Francisco, Seattle and Beaumont and the company's first non-continental plant opened in Honolulu.[34] Jay C. Hormel died on August 30, 1954, and Corey was named chairman of the board and R.F. Gray was elected president the following year.[35] During Gray's tenure as president, the company greatly expanded its international business through arrangements with companies in Ireland, The UK, Canada and Venezuela. Stagg Chili is a brand of chili con carne sold in cans or boxes that was launched in 1956. In 1959, Hormel was the first meatpacker to receive the Seal of Approval of the American Humane Society for its practice of anesthetizing animals before slaughter.[36]
1960s[edit]

Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961[37] and Cure 81 hams were introduced in 1963.[38] In 1962, Hormel constructed a 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) sausage manufacturing building in Austin and discontinued the slaughter of calves and lambs.[39] Also in 1963, Hormel acquired the Queen City Packing Company plant in Springfield, Missouri, and the Ottawa Meat Packing Company plant in Miami, Oklahoma. New plants were also constructed in Chattanooga and Los Angeles and the plants in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Fresno and Houston were remodeled or expanded. In 1964, the Hormel Corporate Offices were opened just to the north of Interstate 90 in Austin. Gray replaced Corey as chairman of the board upon the latter's retirement in 1965, and M.B. Thompson became president.[40] During Thompson's tenure (1965–1969) a dry sausage plant was built in Algona and distribution centers were built in San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. In 1967, the company, in cooperation with the National Merit Scholarship Program, started a college scholarship program for the children of Hormel employees. Partial scholarships were awarded through this program on the basis of the student's test scores, academic records, financial need, and school and community involvement. A separate building to house the growing research and development department was built northwest of the corporate office in Austin in 1968. In 1969, Gray resigned from the company and Thompson replaced him as chairman (by this time the chairman was called the CEO) and I.J. Holton was named president.[41]
1970s[edit]
In 1970, a distribution plant was built in Albany, Georgia, and a dry sausage plant was built in Algona. In 1971, meat processing facilities and distribution centers were opened in both Dallas and Seattle.[41] That same year the company introduced its Matching Gifts program in which it offered to match the donation (up to $2,000) made by any employee to any accredited college or university. In 1972, Holton became CEO and distribution centers were opened in Orlando and Shreveport and a food service facility was built in Oklahoma City. A grocery products plant was opened in Beloit in 1973.[41] On this site the city now boasts the world's largest can of chili. Also in 1973, Hormel Foods became the first company in the meatpacking industry to introduce nutritional and ingredient labeling on meat products.[42] A frozen foods plant was opened in Fort Worth in 1974. A distribution plant was opened in Houston in 1975. In 1976, a slaughtering and processing plant was opened in Ottumwa, a dry sausage plant was opened in Knoxville, Iowa, and a grocery products canning facility was acquired in Stockton. A distribution plant was built in Fresno in 1978. A gelatin plant was opened in Davenport and groundbreaking for a new, one-story Austin plant in 1979.[43] That same year Richard Knowlton was elected as president, the first Austinian to hold that post since Jay Catherwood Hormel.[40]
1980s[edit]
Holton continued as CEO until 1981 and then this duty was also passed to Knowlton. The construction of the current Austin plant began in 1980, and the Knoxville and Ottumwa plants were expanded. The plants in Beloit, Los Angeles and Ottumwa were renovated and expanded.[44] The new Austin plant, a 1,300,000-square-foot (120,000 m2) facility, began production on May 24, 1982, and was dedicated on September 12, 1982.[45] Knowlton also became chairman of the board in 1984, while continuing to hold the titles of president and CEO. Not-So-Sloppy-Joe Sloppy Joe sauce made its debut in 1985.[46] In 1986, Hormel Foods acquired Jennie-O Foods[40] and also began an exclusive licensing arrangement to produce Chi-Chi's brand products.[47] The following year, Hormel Foods introduced the Top Shelf line of microwavable non-frozen products. The company added to their poultry offerings by purchasing Chicken by George, created by former Miss America Phyllis George, in 1988. That same year, Hormel Foods also introduced microwave bacon.[48] In mid-1984, Hormel introduced the Frank 'n Stuff brand of stuffed hot dogs.[46][49][50][51][52]
1985 strike[edit]
In August 1985, Hormel workers went on strike at the Hormel headquarters in Austin, Minnesota. In the early 1980s, recession impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which led smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained.[53] Workers had already labored under a wage freeze and dangerous working conditions, leading to many cases of repetitive strain injury. When management demanded a 23% wage cut from the workers they decided to begin the strike.[54] It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s. The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local P-9, led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized boycott of Hormel products.
After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, called in the National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. This brought protests against the governor, and the National Guard withdrew from Austin. The action had a greater effect on the UFCW international, which ousted the local P-9.
The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages.
The strike was chronicled in the film American Dream, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1990. A song about the strike, entitled "P-9" was written by Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum. The song can be found on their 1989 album Clam Dip & Other Delights.
The strike has also had a Harvard Business School Case written based on it (with assumed names), called "Adam Baxter Co./Local 190" which features multiple rounds of negotiations between unions and management.[55]
1990s[edit]
Hormel Foods celebrated 100 years of operation in 1991. In 1993, the name of the company was officially changed from Geo. A. Hormel & Company to Hormel Foods Corporation. That same year Knowlton retired and Joel W. Johnson became president and CEO. Production facilities were opened in Osceola, Iowa in 1996.
2000s[edit]




The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota


The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, was opened in 2001. That same year, Hormel Foods acquired The Turkey Store, the business was combined with Jennie-O Foods to form Jennie-O Turkey Store.[56] In 2004, Jennie-O Turkey Store launched its Jennie-O Turkey Store Oven Ready turkey. In 2004, Jeffrey M. Ettinger succeeded Johnson as company president and introduced the Billion Dollar Challenge, setting a goal for the company to generate $1 billion in sales from new products by the end of fiscal year 2009.[40] The same year Hormel Foods introduced the first nationally distributed all-natural line of meat products with Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, which utilizes high pressure processing technology.[57] Recent acquisitions by Hormel Foods include: Diamond Crystal Brands (2002),[58] Century Foods International (2003)[59] Clougherty Packing (Farmer John) (2004),[60] Lloyd’s Barbeque Company (2005),[61] Mark-Lynn Foods (2005), Arriba Foods (2005), Provena Foods (2006) and Burke Foods (2007).[62]
In 2004, five new varieties of the Stagg Chili brand were made available nationwide.[63]
In 2008, the company achieved the $1 billion sales goal of the Billion Dollar Challenge a year early and introduced a new challenge introduced to generate $2 billion in sales from new products by 2012.[64]
In 2008, animal rights organization PETA sent members to work undercover at a pig factory farm in Iowa to investigate allegations of animal rights abuses, then released a video record[65] showing workers treating the pigs cruelly and without regard for animal rights. The factory farm was owned by Natural Pork Production II LLP of Iowa until August 18, 2008, at which point ownership had transferred to MowMar LLP. Prior to this the farm was not a supplier to Hormel Foods. Hormel spokeswoman Julie Henderson Craven, who responded to the PETA video, called the videotaped abuses "completely unacceptable."[66] In their 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report, Hormel Foods stated that all suppliers are expected to comply with several welfare programs to ensure that the hogs purchased are treated humanely. Because of the investigation, several employees of the farm were fired and six individuals faced charges due to the abuse.[67]
In November 2008, an article in the New York Times, "SPAM Turns Serious and Hormel Turns Out More," detailed an overwhelming spike in the demand for SPAM, perhaps due to the flagging economy.[68] In July 2009, Hormel and Herdez del Fuerte created the joint venture MegaMex Foods to market and distribute Mexican food in the United States.[69] Brands included in the venture include Herdez, La Victoria, Chi Chi's, El Torito, Embasa, Wholly Guacamole, Del Fuerte, Dona Maria, Bufalo, and Don Miguel.[70]
2010s[edit]

In 2010 Hormel Foods opened Progressive Processing, Inc, in Dubuque, Iowa. The facility was awarded the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold status, one of the first manufacturing facilities to be LEED certified.[71] MegaMex Foods, a joint venture of Hormel Foods and Herdez del Fuerte, acquired Don Miguel Foods, a leading provider of branded frozen and fresh authentic Mexican flavored appetizers, snacks and handheld items.[72]

In 2012, the Spam brand celebrated its 75th anniversary with the introduction of Sir Can A-Lot™, its first ever campaign spokescharacter.[75] Hormel Foods also announced that it met its ambitious “Go for $2B by 2012” goal by achieving $2 billion in total sales from new products created since 2000 by the end of fiscal year 2012.[76] The company's next challenge "The $3B by 2016 Challenge," to achieve $3 billion in total sales of products created since 2000 by the end of 2016 is currently underway.[77]
On January 3, 2013, Hormel Foods announced it had purchased Skippy—the best-selling brand of peanut butter in China and the second-best-selling brand in the world—from Unilever for $700 million; the sale included Skippy's USA and China factories.[78]
The company also began to produce a brand of wrapped tortilla-like snacks dubbed REV. These wraps are essentially miniature tacos, available in several flavors such as pepperoni pizza, ham & cheese, peppered turkey, meat lovers pizza, Italian-style ham, along with several others.[79]
Hormel bought the CytoSport company in June 2014 for about US$450 million, including the Muscle Milk protein supplement brand.[80] In October of that year, Hormel Foods announced a partnership with the Cancer Nutrition Consortium, to provide cancer patients with nutritional offerings for their specific, individual needs during cancer treatment.[81]
In May 2015, Hormel revealed it would acquire meat processing firm Applegate Farms for around $775 million, expanding its range of natural and organic meat products.[82] The company also announced James P. Snee was elected to the position of president and chief operating officer in October 2015.[83] The company was named to the Human Resource Campaign Foundation's Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality in November.[84] In 2015, after an undercover investigation at a Minnesota processing plant, Hormel Foods announced it was bringing humane handling officers to the QPP facility to ensure compliance with its own animal welfare standards. It has also told QPP to provide extra training, enhance compliance oversight and increase third-party auditing. QPP announced plans to strengthen its video monitoring system and improve animal handling equipment.[85]
In 2016, Peak Rock Capital purchased the Diamond Crystal Brands Inc. unit, purchased by Hormel in 2002 for $155 million from Imperial Sugar.[86][87]
Jeffrey Ettinger retired as CEO, effective October 30, 2016. Ettinger remained Chairman of the Board.[1] President & COO James Snee assumed the role of CEO effective October 31, 2016.[1]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Hormel Foods released its first Citizenship Overview, formally reporting the company’s corporate responsibility initiatives in 2007.[88] The company has been included on the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for the last seven consecutive years.[89]
In 2008, Hormel Foods donated funds to The Hormel Institute, which dedicated an expansion to their cancer research facility.[90] The project renovated a building adding research facilities, including space to house the Blue Gene/L supercomputer. The Institute, located in Austin, MN, was the result of a partnership in 1942 between the Hormel Foundation, the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic.
In 2011, Hormel Foods introduced SPAMMY, a fortified, shelf-stable turkey spread to help address childhood malnutrition throughout the world. The company made an initial three-year commitment to deliver 1 million cans to in-need families in Guatemala.[91] In 2014, Hormel Foods announced promising results of the nutrition research portion of Project SPAMMY.[92] In 2015, SPAMMY became available for purchase under Title I for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) feeding programs and Title II for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs under the name fortified poultry-based spread (FPBS).[93]
In 2012, Hormel Foods announced its second set of environmental goals. The company surpassed the water reduction, packaging and solid waste minimization goals of its first set of five-year goals, which ended in 2011.[94] That same year, Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer, was named Responsible CEO of the Year by CR Magazine.[95]
In 2013, Hormel Foods received two AMI environmental achievement awards for the company’s expansion project at the Corporate Office and a water conservation project at Burke Marketing Corp.[96]
In 2015, Hormel Foods announced that it met its solid waste reduction goal six years early. The company's Corporate Responsibility report is available online at www.hormelfoods.com/csr and includes information related to the company’s sustainability performance in 2014.[97]
Allegations of animal abuse[edit]
In January 2016, Mercy For Animals released undercover footage of pigs being abused at a Hormel pork supplier. The undercover video shows piglets having their testicles ripped out and tails cut off without any anesthetic, piglets left to suffer from untreated illness or injuries, piglets with no room to move trampling each other in crowded hallways, and mother pigs crammed into filthy gestation crates unable to move.[98] In response, Hormel suspended its buying from the supplier.[99]

	About Hormel Foods

	A longstanding reputation for quality




	Our founder, George A. Hormel, was very committed to providing his customers the very best products. Our commitment to that principle remains even as our products have evolved to meet your needs today.




	Since 1891, the Hormel® brand has been synonymous with quality, value and innovation.

	Our founder, George A. Hormel held a strong commitment to quality, which was based on providing his customers a superior product that would keep them coming back for more. This vision is kept alive with products that retain the quality and flavor of the first products he offered. Today, our innovative products are a flavorful part of breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and party solutions — all created with convenience in mind to accommodate the busy schedule of you and your family. From the beginning, George was concerned about waste and cleanliness in the process of making great food products. In keeping with his high standards, the Hormel Foods Charitable Trust was established to benefit various organizations and projects that emphasize education, hunger and quality-of-life initiatives in and around Hormel Foods plant communities. We invite you to become more familiar with the diverse array of wholesome and great-tasting foods that are part of the HORMEL® brand — as relevant, delicious and high-quality as ever.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  There have been no material changes in the Company's Critical Accounting Policies, as disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2016.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview  The Company is a processor of branded and unbranded food products for retail, foodservice, and fresh product customers. It operates in five reportable segments as described in Note N "Segment Reporting" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The Company reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.44 for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $0.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Significant factors impacting the quarter were:  * Three of the Company's five segments generated segment profit growth. * The Refrigerated Foods segment grew earnings on value-added product growth. * International & Other (International) segment profit increased due to  * Grocery Products segment profit benefitted from strong value-added product sales.  * Specialty Foods segment profit was flat primarily due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands (DCB) in May 2016.  * Jennie-O Turkey Store (JOTS) profits decreased during the quarter due to much lower turkey commodity prices and higher expenses coupled with competitive pressures.   Consolidated Results Net earnings and diluted earnings per share Three Months Ended (in thousands, except per share amounts) January 29, January 24, % 2017 2016 Change Net earnings $ 235,147 $ 235,061 0.0 Diluted earnings per share 0.44 0.43 2.3  Net sales   Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Net sales $ 2,280,227 $ 2,292,672 (0.5) Adjusted(1) net sales 2,166,661 2,096,854 3.3 Tonnage (lbs.) 1,244,909 1,269,155 (1.9) Adjusted(1) tonnage 1,162,159 1,107,347 4.9  (1) The non-GAAP adjusted financial measurements are presented to provide investors additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. The company believes these non-GAAP adjusted financial measurements provide useful information to investors because they are the measurements used to evaluate performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP measurements are not intended to be a substitute for U.S. GAAP measurements in analyzing financial performance. These non-GAAP measurements are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.  Adjusted net sales and volume excludes the impact from the Justin's, LLC acquisition in May 2016, and the divestitures of the DCB business in May 2016, and the Farmer John business in January 2017. The tables below  Table of Contents  show the calculations to reconcile from the non-GAAP adjusted measures to the GAAP measures in first quarter of fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

Partially offsetting the lower sales, JOTS enjoyed strong demand for branded products coupled with a positive comparison to the prior year which was impacted by turkey supply shortages due to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Grocery Products also showed nice growth in net sales.  Cost of products sold   Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Cost of products sold $ 1,727,947 $ 1,734,661 (0.4)  Cost of products sold was relatively flat for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year as input costs were mixed. Feed costs for JOTS were lower compared to the prior year, but bird yields underperformed. Beef prices were also lower for the first quarter, which provided a benefit to many of the Company's value-added products.  Gross profit   Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Gross profit $ 552,280 $ 558,011 (1.0) Percentage of net sales 24.2 24.3  Higher margins from the Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, International, and Specialty Foods segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were unable to offset the much lower results in the JOTS segment. Solid value-added sales growth for Refrigerated Foods and strong pork exports for the International segment enhanced margins for the quarter. The rapid increases in hog and belly prices in January created short-term margin  Table of Contents  pressures for some of the Company's value-added products. The Company's China meat business continued to be challenged with high raw material costs, resulting in profit declines for the first quarter.  The Company expects continued growth in many value-added retail and foodservice products within Refrigerated Foods, such as Hormel Natural Choice, Hormel Gatherings party trays, Hormel pepperoni, Hormel Bacon 1 fully-cooked bacon, and Hormel Fire Braised meats. Grocery Products is expected to continue to build momentum, especially in the second half of the fiscal year, aided by growth in products lines such as SKIPPY peanut butter, Justin's specialty nut butters, and the Company's Mexican foods portfolio. Specialty Foods will lap the divestiture of DCB in May. Strong export sales are expected for the International segment. While Jennie-O branded products continue to show positive demand trends, JOTS expects to see sustained pressure from the commodity markets and competitive price compression.  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)   Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change SG&A $ 210,217 $ 209,948 0.1 Percentage of net sales 9.2 9.2  SG&A expenses were relatively flat in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year. Lower employee-related expenses offset higher advertising expenses compared to the prior year.  Equity in earnings of affiliates   Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Equity in earnings of affiliates $ 13,299 $ 11,475 15.9  The improved results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflect strong results from the Herdez and Wholly Guacamole brands within the Company's MegaMex Foods, LLC joint venture.  Effective tax rate   Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, 2017 2016 Effective tax rate (%) 33.7 33.6  The Company expects a full-year effective tax rate between 33.0 and 33.5 percent for fiscal 2017.  Table of Contents  Segment Results  Net sales and operating profits for each of the Company's reportable segments are set forth below. The Company is an integrated enterprise, characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations, and sharing of assets. Therefore, the Company does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating profit and other financial information shown below. Additional segment financial information can be found in Note N "Segment Reporting" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Net Sales Grocery Products $417,745 $392,218 6.5 Refrigerated Foods 1,123,039 1,162,121 (3.4 ) Jennie-O Turkey Store 420,989 372,066 13.1 Specialty Foods 192,629 237,779 (19.0 ) International & Other 125,825 128,488 (2.1 ) Total $2,280,227 $2,292,672 (0.5 ) Segment Operating Profit Grocery Products $65,627 $65,273 0.5 Refrigerated Foods 173,808 166,908 4.1 Jennie-O Turkey Store 68,180 91,303 (25.3 ) Specialty Foods 26,749 26,793 (0.2 ) International & Other 25,463 24,287 4.8 Total segment operating profit $359,827 $374,564 (3.9 ) Net interest and investment expense (income) 577 5,370 (89.3 ) General corporate expense 4,621 15,132 (69.5 ) Less: Noncontrolling interest 156 106 47.2 Earnings before income taxes $354,785 $354,168 0.2  Grocery Products Results for the Grocery Products segment compared to the prior year are as follows: Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Net sales $ 417,745 $ 392,218 6.5 Tonnage (lbs.) 225,963 218,265 3.5 Segment profit $ 65,627 $ 65,273 0.5  The addition of Justin's specialty nut butters along with strong sales from brands such as Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, and SKIPPY all contributed to sales and volume growth.  Segment profit results benefited from the increased sales of the categories listed above, partially offset by increased advertising expenses and integration costs for the Justin's business.  The Company anticipates segment profit growth in the second quarter due to the addition of Justin's specialty nut butters and positive sales trends for key product lines including SKIPPY peanut butter and Wholly Guacamole dips.  Table of Contents  Refrigerated Foods Results for the Refrigerated Foods segment compared to the prior year are as follows: Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Net sales $ 1,123,039 $ 1,162,121 (3.4 ) Tonnage (lbs.) 614,425 635,652 (3.3 ) Segment profit $ 173,808 $ 166,908 4.1  The divestiture of Farmer John during the first quarter was the primary contributor to the lower net sales in fiscal 2017. Many of the Company's value-added products enjoyed strong sales growth during the quarter. Innovative foodservice items such as Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel Fire Braised meats delivered solid growth. Retail items such as Hormel Gatherings party trays, Hormel Natural Choice meats, and Applegate bacon and breakfast sausage delivered growth.  Refrigerated Foods segment profit finished above the prior year's strong results with solid value-added profit growth of both retail and foodservice products, partially offset by higher operating expenses.  Looking forward, the Company expects sales growth to be muted by the divestiture of the Farmer John business. Input costs are expected to generally trend higher than fiscal 2016 levels, but continued strong results are expected in the Company's value-added businesses.  Jennie-O Turkey Store Results for the JOTS segment compared to the prior year are as follows: Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Net sales $ 420,989 $ 372,066 13.1 Tonnage (lbs.) 216,643 178,275 21.5 Segment profit $ 68,180 $ 91,303 (25.3 )  The substantial increase in net sales for the quarter is linked to the HPAI impacted results from the prior year. Retail sales of Jennie-O lean ground turkey, Jennie-O turkey bacon, and Jennie-O Oven Ready products improved during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Foodservice and deli sales were also strong, showing significant increases against the HPAI impacted results from the prior year when some products were on allocation.  Segment profit for the first quarter dropped significantly year over year. The first quarter of fiscal 2016 was affected by reduced turkey supplies due to HPAI and substantially higher commodity prices, compared to the multi-year lows experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These impacts, along with increased expenses and increased competition due to an abundance of protein in the market, caused a majority of the decrease.  Looking forward, challenging commodity turkey prices, along with competitive pressures from ground beef will continue to challenge year over year comparisons in the second quarter in tonnage, net sales, and segment profit.  Table of Contents  Specialty Foods Results for the Specialty Foods segment compared to the prior year are as follows: Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Net sales $ 192,629 $ 237,779 (19.0 ) Tonnage (lbs.) 112,829 161,445 (30.1 ) Segment profit $ 26,749 $ 26,793 (0.2 )  The results for the first quarter reflect the May 9, 2016 divestiture of DCB resulting in lower sales and segment profit in fiscal 2017. Muscle Milk protein nutrition products and CytoSport powders provided net sales and segment profit gains to mitigate some of the loss from DCB. Innovative new items such as Muscle Milk bars and yogurt smoothies performed well. Increased advertising investment for Muscle Milk protein nutrition products reduced segment profit gains.  Looking ahead in fiscal 2017, the Company expects the remaining Specialty Foods business to perform better than last year.  International & Other Results for the International segment compared to the prior year are as follows: Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, % (in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Net sales $ 125,825 $ 128,488 (2.1 ) Tonnage (lbs.) 75,049 75,518 (0.6 ) Segment profit $ 25,463 $ 24,287 4.8  Pork exports experienced double-digit net sales growth for the first quarter. However, these gains were unable to offset declines for branded exports compared to the prior year. The declines were primarily due to the timing of shipments into key markets, which shifted volume into the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company's China operations showed net sales improvement for the quarter.  Segment profit results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were driven by strong pork export margins, as markets improved significantly compared to fiscal 2016. This increase more than offset reduced margins due to the delay in export shipments noted above. The Company's China meat business continued to be challenged with high raw material costs, resulting in profit declines for the first quarter.  Entering second quarter, the Company expects pork export margins to remain favorable and growth to resume in branded export categories, including SPAM and SKIPPY. The Company's China operations will continue to be challenged with higher raw material costs though the first half, and start-up costs related to the new plant in Jiaxing, China, which will impact year-over-year comparative results for that business.  Table of Contents  Unallocated Income and Expenses  The Company does not allocate investment income, interest expense, and interest income to its segments when measuring performance. The Company also retains various other income and unallocated expenses at corporate. Equity in earnings of affiliates is included in segment operating profit; however, earnings attributable to the Company's noncontrolling interests are excluded. These items are included in the segment table for the purpose of reconciling segment results to earnings before income taxes.   Three Months Ended January 29, January 24, (in thousands) 2017 2016 Net interest and investment expense (income) $ 577 $ 5,370 Interest expense 3,026 3,407 General corporate expense 4,621 15,132 Noncontrolling interest earnings 156 106  General corporate expenses were lower in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily on lower employee-related and legal expenses.  Related Party Transactions  There has been no material change in the information regarding Related Party Transactions that was disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2016.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Cash and cash equivalents were $609.8 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $375.2 million at the end of the comparable fiscal 2016 period.  Cash provided by operating activities was $177.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $278.7 million in the same period of fiscal 2016. Higher working capital was the primary driver of the lower cash flows.  Cash provided by investing activities was $105.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to cash used of $21.0 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2016. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company received $135.9 million for the sale of Farmer John. Capital expenditures increased $4.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year. The Company currently estimates its fiscal 2017 capital expenditures will be approximately $200.0 million. Projects include completion of the Company's plant in Jiaxing, China, numerous capacity expansions for value-added products, and ongoing investments for food and employee safety.  Cash used in financing activities was $82.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $227.5 million in the same period of fiscal 2016. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the outstanding $185.0 million borrowed to acquire Applegate in fiscal 2015 was paid down. The Company repurchased $30.6 million of its common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to none in fiscal 2016. For additional information pertaining to the Company's share repurchase plans or programs, see Part II, Item 2 "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds."  Cash dividends paid to the Company's shareholders continue to be an ongoing financing activity for the Company. Dividends paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were $76.6 million compared to $66.1 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2017, the annual dividend rate has been increased to $0.68 per share, representing the 51st consecutive annual dividend increase. The Company has paid dividends for 354 consecutive quarters and expects to continue doing so.  The Company is required, by certain covenants in its debt agreements, to maintain specified levels of financial ratios and financial position. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company was in compliance with all of these debt covenants.  Table of Contents  Cash flows from operating activities continue to provide the Company with its principal source of liquidity. The Company does not anticipate a significant risk to cash flows from this source in the foreseeable future because the Company operates in a relatively stable industry and has strong brands across many product lines.  The Company remains dedicated to returning excess cash flow to shareholders through dividend payments. Growing the business through innovation and evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions remains a focus for the Company. Reinvestments in the business to ensure employee and food safety remain a top priority for the Company. Capital spending to enhance and expand current operations will also be a significant cash outflow for fiscal 2017.  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  The Company records income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. The Company is unable to determine its contractual obligations by year related to this pronouncement, as the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of its reserves for income taxes cannot be reasonably estimated. The total liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, at January 29, 2017, was $20.6 million.  There have been no other material changes to the information regarding the Company's future contractual financial obligations that was disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2016.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of January 29, 2017, and October 30, 2016, the Company had $46.9 million and $44.4 million, respectively, of standby letters of credit issued on its behalf. The standby letters of credit are primarily related to the Company's self-insured workers compensation programs. However, that amount also includes revocable standby letters of credit totaling $4.0 million for obligations of an affiliated party that may arise under workers' compensation claims. Letters of credit are not reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  Trademarks  References to the Company's brands or products in italics within this report represent valuable trademarks owned or licensed by Hormel Foods, LLC or other subsidiaries of Hormel Foods Corporation.

History[edit]
19th century[edit]




The building in which George A. Hormel started his business. Preserved at the Mower County Fairgrounds in Austin.


George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer. His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there, borrow $500, and open a meat business. Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail side. The two dissolved their partnership in 1891 so that Hormel could start a complete meat packing operation on his own.[8] He opened George A. Hormel & Co. in the northeast part of Austin in an old creamery building on the Cedar River. To make ends meet in those early days, Hormel continued to trade in hides, eggs, wool, and poultry. Joining George in November 1891 was his youngest brother, Benjamin, age 14. By the end of 1891 Hormel employed six men and had slaughtered and sold 610 head of livestock. By 1893, the increased use of refrigerator cars and greater efficiency had forced smaller businesses to collapse. Two additional Hormel brothers, Herman and John, joined the business that same year, and together they processed 1,532 hogs. The remaining members of the Hormel family moved to Austin in 1895 and joined the growing business. George turned to full-time management in 1899, and focused on increasing production.[9]
1900s[edit]
In 1901, the plant was expanded and the business was incorporated. The first directors were A.L. Eberhart and the four Hormel brothers: George, Herman, John and Ben. In 1903 George decided to add a three-story hog-kill, a two-story beef-kill, an annex, an engine room, a machine shop and a casing production department.[10] The name Dairy Brand was registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1903. In the first decade of the 20th century distribution centers were opened in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Birmingham. George Hormel visited England in 1905 and started exporting products soon after.[11]
1910s[edit]
By 1910, Hormel products were routinely appearing in national magazines.[12] That same year the company developed a procedure to recycle its waste water by daily evaporating up to 9,000 gallons of water, leaving a syrupy liquid which was dried to produce a commercial fertilizer. In 1915 Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar Cervelat, Holsteiner and Noxall Salami.[13] That same year Hormel bought Alderson's Mill and began selling Hormel Peerless Minnesota flour nationwide.[14] Hormel joined the World War I effort, George's son Jay C. went into military service[15] and by the end of the war, exports accounted for 33% of the company's yearly volume.[16]
1920s[edit]




The Hormel plant circa 1920


In 1921, when Jay Hormel returned from service in WWI, he uncovered that assistant controller Cy Thomson had embezzled $1,187,000 from the company over the previous ten years. The embezzlement scandal provided George Hormel with additional incentive to fortify his company. He did so by arranging for more reliable capital management, by dismissing unproductive employees, and by continuing to develop new products.[17] In 1926, the company introduced Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham, America's first canned ham and it added chicken to its line in 1928.[18] Jay C. Hormel became company president in 1929 and that same year the plant was expanded again to include eight new structures and the main office was tripled in size.[19] In the late 1920s and early 1930s sales branches opened in Houston, Beaumont, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Newark, Los Angeles, Vicksburg, and Nuevo Laredo (Mexico).[20]
1930s[edit]
In 1931, Jay C. instituted the Annual Wage Plan: under this plan, employees were paid weekly and they were guaranteed 52 weeks' notice before termination of employment.[21] He also introduced incentive pay, profit sharing and pension plans to the company.[22] Later that year a slaughtering plant was constructed in Mitchell, South Dakota, and in 1933, a cattle slaughtering plant was finished in Austin. John G. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1933 following 40 years of service.[23] Dinty Moore beef stew was introduced in 1935 first created by Ryen "Gunns" Gunning and Hormel Chili and Spam soon followed in 1936 and 1937 respectively.[24] In 1938, Jay C. Hormel introduced the "Joint Savings Plan" which allowed employees to share in the proceeds of the company.[25] By the late-1930s, full-page, four color ads were routinely appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Hormel ads also were featured on the radio program The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.
In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation's first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO).[26][27][28]
The 1930s also saw the establishment of the Hormel & Co. refrigerator car line, with an initial roster of 125 units.
1940s[edit]




The Hormel obelisk in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery.


After reaching sales of $75 million in 1941, George and Jay established The Hormel Foundation to provide perpetual independence of the company, act as trustees of the family trusts and to start and fund The Hormel Institute, a research unit at the University of Minnesota.[29] Benjamin F. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1941 after completing 50 years of service.[30] Hormel's production increased to aid in World War II and 65% of its products were purchased by the U.S. government by 1945.[31] Founder George A. Hormel died in 1946 in California where he had lived in retirement. He is buried in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery. Jay C. then became chairman of the board, H.H. Corey became president, and R.F. Gray became vice-president.[32] Hormel acquired the Fremont Packing Company in 1947.[33]
1950s[edit]
In 1953, it acquired the Tobin Packing Company of Fort Dodge. Also in 1953, distribution centers were opened in San Francisco, Seattle and Beaumont and the company's first non-continental plant opened in Honolulu.[34] Jay C. Hormel died on August 30, 1954, and Corey was named chairman of the board and R.F. Gray was elected president the following year.[35] During Gray's tenure as president, the company greatly expanded its international business through arrangements with companies in Ireland, The UK, Canada and Venezuela. Stagg Chili is a brand of chili con carne sold in cans or boxes that was launched in 1956. In 1959, Hormel was the first meatpacker to receive the Seal of Approval of the American Humane Society for its practice of anesthetizing animals before slaughter.[36]
1960s[edit]

Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961[37] and Cure 81 hams were introduced in 1963.[38] In 1962, Hormel constructed a 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) sausage manufacturing building in Austin and discontinued the slaughter of calves and lambs.[39] Also in 1963, Hormel acquired the Queen City Packing Company plant in Springfield, Missouri, and the Ottawa Meat Packing Company plant in Miami, Oklahoma. New plants were also constructed in Chattanooga and Los Angeles and the plants in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Fresno and Houston were remodeled or expanded. In 1964, the Hormel Corporate Offices were opened just to the north of Interstate 90 in Austin. Gray replaced Corey as chairman of the board upon the latter's retirement in 1965, and M.B. Thompson became president.[40] During Thompson's tenure (1965–1969) a dry sausage plant was built in Algona and distribution centers were built in San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. In 1967, the company, in cooperation with the National Merit Scholarship Program, started a college scholarship program for the children of Hormel employees. Partial scholarships were awarded through this program on the basis of the student's test scores, academic records, financial need, and school and community involvement. A separate building to house the growing research and development department was built northwest of the corporate office in Austin in 1968. In 1969, Gray resigned from the company and Thompson replaced him as chairman (by this time the chairman was called the CEO) and I.J. Holton was named president.[41]
1970s[edit]
In 1970, a distribution plant was built in Albany, Georgia, and a dry sausage plant was built in Algona. In 1971, meat processing facilities and distribution centers were opened in both Dallas and Seattle.[41] That same year the company introduced its Matching Gifts program in which it offered to match the donation (up to $2,000) made by any employee to any accredited college or university. In 1972, Holton became CEO and distribution centers were opened in Orlando and Shreveport and a food service facility was built in Oklahoma City. A grocery products plant was opened in Beloit in 1973.[41] On this site the city now boasts the world's largest can of chili. Also in 1973, Hormel Foods became the first company in the meatpacking industry to introduce nutritional and ingredient labeling on meat products.[42] A frozen foods plant was opened in Fort Worth in 1974. A distribution plant was opened in Houston in 1975. In 1976, a slaughtering and processing plant was opened in Ottumwa, a dry sausage plant was opened in Knoxville, Iowa, and a grocery products canning facility was acquired in Stockton. A distribution plant was built in Fresno in 1978. A gelatin plant was opened in Davenport and groundbreaking for a new, one-story Austin plant in 1979.[43] That same year Richard Knowlton was elected as president, the first Austinian to hold that post since Jay Catherwood Hormel.[40]
1980s[edit]
Holton continued as CEO until 1981 and then this duty was also passed to Knowlton. The construction of the current Austin plant began in 1980, and the Knoxville and Ottumwa plants were expanded. The plants in Beloit, Los Angeles and Ottumwa were renovated and expanded.[44] The new Austin plant, a 1,300,000-square-foot (120,000 m2) facility, began production on May 24, 1982, and was dedicated on September 12, 1982.[45] Knowlton also became chairman of the board in 1984, while continuing to hold the titles of president and CEO. Not-So-Sloppy-Joe Sloppy Joe sauce made its debut in 1985.[46] In 1986, Hormel Foods acquired Jennie-O Foods[40] and also began an exclusive licensing arrangement to produce Chi-Chi's brand products.[47] The following year, Hormel Foods introduced the Top Shelf line of microwavable non-frozen products. The company added to their poultry offerings by purchasing Chicken by George, created by former Miss America Phyllis George, in 1988. That same year, Hormel Foods also introduced microwave bacon.[48] In mid-1984, Hormel introduced the Frank 'n Stuff brand of stuffed hot dogs.[46][49][50][51][52]
1985 strike[edit]
In August 1985, Hormel workers went on strike at the Hormel headquarters in Austin, Minnesota. In the early 1980s, recession impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which led smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained.[53] Workers had already labored under a wage freeze and dangerous working conditions, leading to many cases of repetitive strain injury. When management demanded a 23% wage cut from the workers they decided to begin the strike.[54] It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s. The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local P-9, led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized boycott of Hormel products.
After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, called in the National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. This brought protests against the governor, and the National Guard withdrew from Austin. The action had a greater effect on the UFCW international, which ousted the local P-9.
The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages.
The strike was chronicled in the film American Dream, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1990. A song about the strike, entitled "P-9" was written by Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum. The song can be found on their 1989 album Clam Dip & Other Delights.
The strike has also had a Harvard Business School Case written based on it (with assumed names), called "Adam Baxter Co./Local 190" which features multiple rounds of negotiations between unions and management.[55]
1990s[edit]
Hormel Foods celebrated 100 years of operation in 1991. In 1993, the name of the company was officially changed from Geo. A. Hormel & Company to Hormel Foods Corporation. That same year Knowlton retired and Joel W. Johnson became president and CEO. Production facilities were opened in Osceola, Iowa in 1996.
2000s[edit]




The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota


The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, was opened in 2001. That same year, Hormel Foods acquired The Turkey Store, the business was combined with Jennie-O Foods to form Jennie-O Turkey Store.[56] In 2004, Jennie-O Turkey Store launched its Jennie-O Turkey Store Oven Ready turkey. In 2004, Jeffrey M. Ettinger succeeded Johnson as company president and introduced the Billion Dollar Challenge, setting a goal for the company to generate $1 billion in sales from new products by the end of fiscal year 2009.[40] The same year Hormel Foods introduced the first nationally distributed all-natural line of meat products with Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, which utilizes high pressure processing technology.[57] Recent acquisitions by Hormel Foods include: Diamond Crystal Brands (2002),[58] Century Foods International (2003)[59] Clougherty Packing (Farmer John) (2004),[60] Lloyd’s Barbeque Company (2005),[61] Mark-Lynn Foods (2005), Arriba Foods (2005), Provena Foods (2006) and Burke Foods (2007).[62]
In 2004, five new varieties of the Stagg Chili brand were made available nationwide.[63]
In 2008, the company achieved the $1 billion sales goal of the Billion Dollar Challenge a year early and introduced a new challenge introduced to generate $2 billion in sales from new products by 2012.[64]
In 2008, animal rights organization PETA sent members to work undercover at a pig factory farm in Iowa to investigate allegations of animal rights abuses, then released a video record[65] showing workers treating the pigs cruelly and without regard for animal rights. The factory farm was owned by Natural Pork Production II LLP of Iowa until August 18, 2008, at which point ownership had transferred to MowMar LLP. Prior to this the farm was not a supplier to Hormel Foods. Hormel spokeswoman Julie Henderson Craven, who responded to the PETA video, called the videotaped abuses "completely unacceptable."[66] In their 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report, Hormel Foods stated that all suppliers are expected to comply with several welfare programs to ensure that the hogs purchased are treated humanely. Because of the investigation, several employees of the farm were fired and six individuals faced charges due to the abuse.[67]
In November 2008, an article in the New York Times, "SPAM Turns Serious and Hormel Turns Out More," detailed an overwhelming spike in the demand for SPAM, perhaps due to the flagging economy.[68] In July 2009, Hormel and Herdez del Fuerte created the joint venture MegaMex Foods to market and distribute Mexican food in the United States.[69] Brands included in the venture include Herdez, La Victoria, Chi Chi's, El Torito, Embasa, Wholly Guacamole, Del Fuerte, Dona Maria, Bufalo, and Don Miguel.[70]

On January 3, 2013, Hormel Foods announced it had purchased Skippy—the best-selling brand of peanut butter in China and the second-best-selling brand in the world—from Unilever for $700 million; the sale included Skippy's USA and China factories.[78]
The company also began to produce a brand of wrapped tortilla-like snacks dubbed REV. These wraps are essentially miniature tacos, available in several flavors such as pepperoni pizza, ham & cheese, peppered turkey, meat lovers pizza, Italian-style ham, along with several others.[79]
Hormel bought the CytoSport company in June 2014 for about US$450 million, including the Muscle Milk protein supplement brand.[80] In October of that year, Hormel Foods announced a partnership with the Cancer Nutrition Consortium, to provide cancer patients with nutritional offerings for their specific, individual needs during cancer treatment.[81]
In May 2015, Hormel revealed it would acquire meat processing firm Applegate Farms for around $775 million, expanding its range of natural and organic meat products.[82] The company also announced James P. Snee was elected to the position of president and chief operating officer in October 2015.[83] The company was named to the Human Resource Campaign Foundation's Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality in November.[84] In 2015, after an undercover investigation at a Minnesota processing plant, Hormel Foods announced it was bringing humane handling officers to the QPP facility to ensure compliance with its own animal welfare standards. It has also told QPP to provide extra training, enhance compliance oversight and increase third-party auditing. QPP announced plans to strengthen its video monitoring system and improve animal handling equipment.[85]
In 2016, Peak Rock Capital purchased the Diamond Crystal Brands Inc. unit, purchased by Hormel in 2002 for $155 million from Imperial Sugar.[86][87]
Jeffrey Ettinger retired as CEO, effective October 30, 2016. Ettinger remained Chairman of the Board.[1] President & COO James Snee assumed the role of CEO effective October 31, 2016.[1]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Hormel Foods released its first Citizenship Overview, formally reporting the company’s corporate responsibility initiatives in 2007.[88] The company has been included on the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for the last seven consecutive years.[89]
In 2008, Hormel Foods donated funds to The Hormel Institute, which dedicated an expansion to their cancer research facility.[90] The project renovated a building adding research facilities, including space to house the Blue Gene/L supercomputer. The Institute, located in Austin, MN, was the result of a partnership in 1942 between the Hormel Foundation, the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic.
In 2011, Hormel Foods introduced SPAMMY, a fortified, shelf-stable turkey spread to help address childhood malnutrition throughout the world. The company made an initial three-year commitment to deliver 1 million cans to in-need families in Guatemala.[91] In 2014, Hormel Foods announced promising results of the nutrition research portion of Project SPAMMY.[92] In 2015, SPAMMY became available for purchase under Title I for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) feeding programs and Title II for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs under the name fortified poultry-based spread (FPBS).[93]
In 2012, Hormel Foods announced its second set of environmental goals. The company surpassed the water reduction, packaging and solid waste minimization goals of its first set of five-year goals, which ended in 2011.[94] That same year, Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer, was named Responsible CEO of the Year by CR Magazine.[95]
In 2013, Hormel Foods received two AMI environmental achievement awards for the company’s expansion project at the Corporate Office and a water conservation project at Burke Marketing Corp.[96]
In 2015, Hormel Foods announced that it met its solid waste reduction goal six years early. The company's Corporate Responsibility report is available online at www.hormelfoods.com/csr and includes information related to the company’s sustainability performance in 2014.[97]
Allegations of animal abuse[edit]
In January 2016, Mercy For Animals released undercover footage of pigs being abused at a Hormel pork supplier. The undercover video shows piglets having their testicles ripped out and tails cut off without any anesthetic, piglets left to suffer from untreated illness or injuries, piglets with no room to move trampling each other in crowded hallways, and mother pigs crammed into filthy gestation crates unable to move.[98] In response, Hormel suspended its buying from the supplier.[99]

History[edit]
19th century[edit]




The building in which George A. Hormel started his business. Preserved at the Mower County Fairgrounds in Austin.


George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer. His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there, borrow $500, and open a meat business. Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail side. The two dissolved their partnership in 1891 so that Hormel could start a complete meat packing operation on his own.[8] He opened George A. Hormel & Co. in the northeast part of Austin in an old creamery building on the Cedar River. To make ends meet in those early days, Hormel continued to trade in hides, eggs, wool, and poultry. Joining George in November 1891 was his youngest brother, Benjamin, age 14. By the end of 1891 Hormel employed six men and had slaughtered and sold 610 head of livestock. By 1893, the increased use of refrigerator cars and greater efficiency had forced smaller businesses to collapse. Two additional Hormel brothers, Herman and John, joined the business that same year, and together they processed 1,532 hogs. The remaining members of the Hormel family moved to Austin in 1895 and joined the growing business. George turned to full-time management in 1899, and focused on increasing production.[9]
1900s[edit]
In 1901, the plant was expanded and the business was incorporated. The first directors were A.L. Eberhart and the four Hormel brothers: George, Herman, John and Ben. In 1903 George decided to add a three-story hog-kill, a two-story beef-kill, an annex, an engine room, a machine shop and a casing production department.[10] The name Dairy Brand was registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1903. In the first decade of the 20th century distribution centers were opened in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Birmingham. George Hormel visited England in 1905 and started exporting products soon after.[11]
1910s[edit]
By 1910, Hormel products were routinely appearing in national magazines.[12] That same year the company developed a procedure to recycle its waste water by daily evaporating up to 9,000 gallons of water, leaving a syrupy liquid which was dried to produce a commercial fertilizer. In 1915 Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar Cervelat, Holsteiner and Noxall Salami.[13] That same year Hormel bought Alderson's Mill and began selling Hormel Peerless Minnesota flour nationwide.[14] Hormel joined the World War I effort, George's son Jay C. went into military service[15] and by the end of the war, exports accounted for 33% of the company's yearly volume.[16]
1920s[edit]




The Hormel plant circa 1920


In 1921, when Jay Hormel returned from service in WWI, he uncovered that assistant controller Cy Thomson had embezzled $1,187,000 from the company over the previous ten years. The embezzlement scandal provided George Hormel with additional incentive to fortify his company. He did so by arranging for more reliable capital management, by dismissing unproductive employees, and by continuing to develop new products.[17] In 1926, the company introduced Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham, America's first canned ham and it added chicken to its line in 1928.[18] Jay C. Hormel became company president in 1929 and that same year the plant was expanded again to include eight new structures and the main office was tripled in size.[19] In the late 1920s and early 1930s sales branches opened in Houston, Beaumont, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Newark, Los Angeles, Vicksburg, and Nuevo Laredo (Mexico).[20]
1930s[edit]
In 1931, Jay C. instituted the Annual Wage Plan: under this plan, employees were paid weekly and they were guaranteed 52 weeks' notice before termination of employment.[21] He also introduced incentive pay, profit sharing and pension plans to the company.[22] Later that year a slaughtering plant was constructed in Mitchell, South Dakota, and in 1933, a cattle slaughtering plant was finished in Austin. John G. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1933 following 40 years of service.[23] Dinty Moore beef stew was introduced in 1935 first created by Ryen "Gunns" Gunning and Hormel Chili and Spam soon followed in 1936 and 1937 respectively.[24] In 1938, Jay C. Hormel introduced the "Joint Savings Plan" which allowed employees to share in the proceeds of the company.[25] By the late-1930s, full-page, four color ads were routinely appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Hormel ads also were featured on the radio program The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.
In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation's first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO).[26][27][28]
The 1930s also saw the establishment of the Hormel & Co. refrigerator car line, with an initial roster of 125 units.
1940s[edit]




The Hormel obelisk in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery.


After reaching sales of $75 million in 1941, George and Jay established The Hormel Foundation to provide perpetual independence of the company, act as trustees of the family trusts and to start and fund The Hormel Institute, a research unit at the University of Minnesota.[29] Benjamin F. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1941 after completing 50 years of service.[30] Hormel's production increased to aid in World War II and 65% of its products were purchased by the U.S. government by 1945.[31] Founder George A. Hormel died in 1946 in California where he had lived in retirement. He is buried in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery. Jay C. then became chairman of the board, H.H. Corey became president, and R.F. Gray became vice-president.[32] Hormel acquired the Fremont Packing Company in 1947.[33]
1950s[edit]
In 1953, it acquired the Tobin Packing Company of Fort Dodge. Also in 1953, distribution centers were opened in San Francisco, Seattle and Beaumont and the company's first non-continental plant opened in Honolulu.[34] Jay C. Hormel died on August 30, 1954, and Corey was named chairman of the board and R.F. Gray was elected president the following year.[35] During Gray's tenure as president, the company greatly expanded its international business through arrangements with companies in Ireland, The UK, Canada and Venezuela. Stagg Chili is a brand of chili con carne sold in cans or boxes that was launched in 1956. In 1959, Hormel was the first meatpacker to receive the Seal of Approval of the American Humane Society for its practice of anesthetizing animals before slaughter.[36]
1960s[edit]

Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961[37] and Cure 81 hams were introduced in 1963.[38] In 1962, Hormel constructed a 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) sausage manufacturing building in Austin and discontinued the slaughter of calves and lambs.[39] Also in 1963, Hormel acquired the Queen City Packing Company plant in Springfield, Missouri, and the Ottawa Meat Packing Company plant in Miami, Oklahoma. New plants were also constructed in Chattanooga and Los Angeles and the plants in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Fresno and Houston were remodeled or expanded. In 1964, the Hormel Corporate Offices were opened just to the north of Interstate 90 in Austin. Gray replaced Corey as chairman of the board upon the latter's retirement in 1965, and M.B. Thompson became president.[40] During Thompson's tenure (1965–1969) a dry sausage plant was built in Algona and distribution centers were built in San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. In 1967, the company, in cooperation with the National Merit Scholarship Program, started a college scholarship program for the children of Hormel employees. Partial scholarships were awarded through this program on the basis of the student's test scores, academic records, financial need, and school and community involvement. A separate building to house the growing research and development department was built northwest of the corporate office in Austin in 1968. In 1969, Gray resigned from the company and Thompson replaced him as chairman (by this time the chairman was called the CEO) and I.J. Holton was named president.[41]
1970s[edit]
In 1970, a distribution plant was built in Albany, Georgia, and a dry sausage plant was built in Algona. In 1971, meat processing facilities and distribution centers were opened in both Dallas and Seattle.[41] That same year the company introduced its Matching Gifts program in which it offered to match the donation (up to $2,000) made by any employee to any accredited college or university. In 1972, Holton became CEO and distribution centers were opened in Orlando and Shreveport and a food service facility was built in Oklahoma City. A grocery products plant was opened in Beloit in 1973.[41] On this site the city now boasts the world's largest can of chili. Also in 1973, Hormel Foods became the first company in the meatpacking industry to introduce nutritional and ingredient labeling on meat products.[42] A frozen foods plant was opened in Fort Worth in 1974. A distribution plant was opened in Houston in 1975. In 1976, a slaughtering and processing plant was opened in Ottumwa, a dry sausage plant was opened in Knoxville, Iowa, and a grocery products canning facility was acquired in Stockton. A distribution plant was built in Fresno in 1978. A gelatin plant was opened in Davenport and groundbreaking for a new, one-story Austin plant in 1979.[43] That same year Richard Knowlton was elected as president, the first Austinian to hold that post since Jay Catherwood Hormel.[40]
1980s[edit]
Holton continued as CEO until 1981 and then this duty was also passed to Knowlton. The construction of the current Austin plant began in 1980, and the Knoxville and Ottumwa plants were expanded. The plants in Beloit, Los Angeles and Ottumwa were renovated and expanded.[44] The new Austin plant, a 1,300,000-square-foot (120,000 m2) facility, began production on May 24, 1982, and was dedicated on September 12, 1982.[45] Knowlton also became chairman of the board in 1984, while continuing to hold the titles of president and CEO. Not-So-Sloppy-Joe Sloppy Joe sauce made its debut in 1985.[46] In 1986, Hormel Foods acquired Jennie-O Foods[40] and also began an exclusive licensing arrangement to produce Chi-Chi's brand products.[47] The following year, Hormel Foods introduced the Top Shelf line of microwavable non-frozen products. The company added to their poultry offerings by purchasing Chicken by George, created by former Miss America Phyllis George, in 1988. That same year, Hormel Foods also introduced microwave bacon.[48] In mid-1984, Hormel introduced the Frank 'n Stuff brand of stuffed hot dogs.[46][49][50][51][52]
1985 strike[edit]
In August 1985, Hormel workers went on strike at the Hormel headquarters in Austin, Minnesota. In the early 1980s, recession impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which led smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained.[53] Workers had already labored under a wage freeze and dangerous working conditions, leading to many cases of repetitive strain injury. When management demanded a 23% wage cut from the workers they decided to begin the strike.[54] It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s. The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local P-9, led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized boycott of Hormel products.
After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, called in the National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. This brought protests against the governor, and the National Guard withdrew from Austin. The action had a greater effect on the UFCW international, which ousted the local P-9.
The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages.
The strike was chronicled in the film American Dream, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1990. A song about the strike, entitled "P-9" was written by Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum. The song can be found on their 1989 album Clam Dip & Other Delights.
The strike has also had a Harvard Business School Case written based on it (with assumed names), called "Adam Baxter Co./Local 190" which features multiple rounds of negotiations between unions and management.[55]
1990s[edit]
Hormel Foods celebrated 100 years of operation in 1991. In 1993, the name of the company was officially changed from Geo. A. Hormel & Company to Hormel Foods Corporation. That same year Knowlton retired and Joel W. Johnson became president and CEO. Production facilities were opened in Osceola, Iowa in 1996.
2000s[edit]




The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota


The SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, was opened in 2001. That same year, Hormel Foods acquired The Turkey Store, the business was combined with Jennie-O Foods to form Jennie-O Turkey Store.[56] In 2004, Jennie-O Turkey Store launched its Jennie-O Turkey Store Oven Ready turkey. In 2004, Jeffrey M. Ettinger succeeded Johnson as company president and introduced the Billion Dollar Challenge, setting a goal for the company to generate $1 billion in sales from new products by the end of fiscal year 2009.[40] The same year Hormel Foods introduced the first nationally distributed all-natural line of meat products with Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, which utilizes high pressure processing technology.[57] Recent acquisitions by Hormel Foods include: Diamond Crystal Brands (2002),[58] Century Foods International (2003)[59] Clougherty Packing (Farmer John) (2004),[60] Lloyd’s Barbeque Company (2005),[61] Mark-Lynn Foods (2005), Arriba Foods (2005), Provena Foods (2006) and Burke Foods (2007).[62]
In 2004, five new varieties of the Stagg Chili brand were made available nationwide.[63]
In 2008, the company achieved the $1 billion sales goal of the Billion Dollar Challenge a year early and introduced a new challenge introduced to generate $2 billion in sales from new products by 2012.[64]
In 2008, animal rights organization PETA sent members to work undercover at a pig factory farm in Iowa to investigate allegations of animal rights abuses, then released a video record[65] showing workers treating the pigs cruelly and without regard for animal rights. The factory farm was owned by Natural Pork Production II LLP of Iowa until August 18, 2008, at which point ownership had transferred to MowMar LLP. Prior to this the farm was not a supplier to Hormel Foods. Hormel spokeswoman Julie Henderson Craven, who responded to the PETA video, called the videotaped abuses "completely unacceptable."[66] In their 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report, Hormel Foods stated that all suppliers are expected to comply with several welfare programs to ensure that the hogs purchased are treated humanely. Because of the investigation, several employees of the farm were fired and six individuals faced charges due to the abuse.[67]
In November 2008, an article in the New York Times, "SPAM Turns Serious and Hormel Turns Out More," detailed an overwhelming spike in the demand for SPAM, perhaps due to the flagging economy.[68] In July 2009, Hormel and Herdez del Fuerte created the joint venture MegaMex Foods to market and distribute Mexican food in the United States.[69] Brands included in the venture include Herdez, La Victoria, Chi Chi's, El Torito, Embasa, Wholly Guacamole, Del Fuerte, Dona Maria, Bufalo, and Don Miguel.[70]
2010s[edit]




Skippy peanut butter, a brand acquired in 2013.


In 2010 Hormel Foods opened Progressive Processing, Inc, in Dubuque, Iowa. The facility was awarded the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold status, one of the first manufacturing facilities to be LEED certified.[71] MegaMex Foods, a joint venture of Hormel Foods and Herdez del Fuerte, acquired Don Miguel Foods, a leading provider of branded frozen and fresh authentic Mexican flavored appetizers, snacks and handheld items.[72]
In 2011, Hormel Foods announced a 2 for 1 stock split.[73] Hormel Foods also acquired Fresherized Foods, makers of Wholly Guacamole, as part of their MegaMex joint venture.[74]
In 2012, the Spam brand celebrated its 75th anniversary with the introduction of Sir Can A-Lot™, its first ever campaign spokescharacter.[75] Hormel Foods also announced that it met its ambitious “Go for $2B by 2012” goal by achieving $2 billion in total sales from new products created since 2000 by the end of fiscal year 2012.[76] The company's next challenge "The $3B by 2016 Challenge," to achieve $3 billion in total sales of products created since 2000 by the end of 2016 is currently underway.[77]
On January 3, 2013, Hormel Foods announced it had purchased Skippy—the best-selling brand of peanut butter in China and the second-best-selling brand in the world—from Unilever for $700 million; the sale included Skippy's USA and China factories.[78]
The company also began to produce a brand of wrapped tortilla-like snacks dubbed REV. These wraps are essentially miniature tacos, available in several flavors such as pepperoni pizza, ham & cheese, peppered turkey, meat lovers pizza, Italian-style ham, along with several others.[79]
Hormel bought the CytoSport company in June 2014 for about US$450 million, including the Muscle Milk protein supplement brand.[80] In October of that year, Hormel Foods announced a partnership with the Cancer Nutrition Consortium, to provide cancer patients with nutritional offerings for their specific, individual needs during cancer treatment.[81]
In May 2015, Hormel revealed it would acquire meat processing firm Applegate Farms for around $775 million, expanding its range of natural and organic meat products.[82] The company also announced James P. Snee was elected to the position of president and chief operating officer in October 2015.[83] The company was named to the Human Resource Campaign Foundation's Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality in November.[84] In 2015, after an undercover investigation at a Minnesota processing plant, Hormel Foods announced it was bringing humane handling officers to the QPP facility to ensure compliance with its own animal welfare standards. It has also told QPP to provide extra training, enhance compliance oversight and increase third-party auditing. QPP announced plans to strengthen its video monitoring system and improve animal handling equipment.[85]
In 2016, Peak Rock Capital purchased the Diamond Crystal Brands Inc. unit, purchased by Hormel in 2002 for $155 million from Imperial Sugar.[86][87]
Jeffrey Ettinger retired as CEO, effective October 30, 2016. Ettinger remained Chairman of the Board.[1] President & COO James Snee assumed the role of CEO effective October 31, 2016.[1]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Hormel Foods released its first Citizenship Overview, formally reporting the company’s corporate responsibility initiatives in 2007.[88] The company has been included on the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for the last seven consecutive years.[89]
In 2008, Hormel Foods donated funds to The Hormel Institute, which dedicated an expansion to their cancer research facility.[90] The project renovated a building adding research facilities, including space to house the Blue Gene/L supercomputer. The Institute, located in Austin, MN, was the result of a partnership in 1942 between the Hormel Foundation, the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic.
In 2011, Hormel Foods introduced SPAMMY, a fortified, shelf-stable turkey spread to help address childhood malnutrition throughout the world. The company made an initial three-year commitment to deliver 1 million cans to in-need families in Guatemala.[91] In 2014, Hormel Foods announced promising results of the nutrition research portion of Project SPAMMY.[92] In 2015, SPAMMY became available for purchase under Title I for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) feeding programs and Title II for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs under the name fortified poultry-based spread (FPBS).[93]
In 2012, Hormel Foods announced its second set of environmental goals. The company surpassed the water reduction, packaging and solid waste minimization goals of its first set of five-year goals, which ended in 2011.[94] That same year, Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer, was named Responsible CEO of the Year by CR Magazine.[95]
In 2013, Hormel Foods received two AMI environmental achievement awards for the company’s expansion project at the Corporate Office and a water conservation project at Burke Marketing Corp.[96]
In 2015, Hormel Foods announced that it met its solid waste reduction goal six years early. The company's Corporate Responsibility report is available online at www.hormelfoods.com/csr and includes information related to the company’s sustainability performance in 2014.[97]
Allegations of animal abuse[edit]
In January 2016, Mercy For Animals released undercover footage of pigs being abused at a Hormel pork supplier. The undercover video shows piglets having their testicles ripped out and tails cut off without any anesthetic, piglets left to suffer from untreated illness or injuries, piglets with no room to move trampling each other in crowded hallways, and mother pigs crammed into filthy gestation crates unable to move.[98] In response, Hormel suspended its buying from the supplier.[99]
