Desigual H1 sales decline 9.6 percent




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 28 2017 


Desigual performance in the first half of 2017, the company said, was
hampered by a drop in multi-brand distribution network and company-owned
store sales. Desigual reported revenue of 377.9 million euros (442 million
dollars), down 9.6 percent on H1 2016, including a decline of 8.5 percent
in Q2 2017.
The company said, H1 decline stems primarily from a decrease in
wholesale orders in the multi-brand distribution network for the
spring/summer collection, following poor sales of previous collections; and
a drop in company-owned store revenue, mainly due to the ongoing
rationalization plan.
Desigual expects winter/fall 2017 collection to track the spring/summer
collection. The company, however, reported healthy performance in the
digital segment, with double-digit sales growth. The digital segment
currently accounts for 11 percent of revenue. H1 2017 EBITDA amounted to
54.6 million euros (63.9 million dollars), down 23.6 percent on last year.
This decline, the company said, mainly reflects a slowdown in activity,
despite the positive impacts of the management strategic plan, which should
continue in coming periods.

Adidas says Q2 revenues improved 19 percent




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 28 2017 


For the second quarter, Adidas said that revenues from the
company’s continuing operations increased 19 percent on a currency-neutral
basis and 20 percent in euro terms to 5 billion euros (5.8 billion
dollars). The company said, operating profit increased 18 percent to 505
million euros (590 million dollars) driven by a higher gross margin as well
as operating expense leverage. Net income from continuing operations
increased 16 percent to 347 million euros (405 million dollars) during the
quarter.
Adidas said, as previously announced, due to the existence of signed
agreements to divest the TaylorMade, Adams Golf, Ashworth and CCM Hockey
brands, the results from these businesses are reported as discontinued
operations. In the second quarter, the TaylorMade and CCM Hockey
divestitures had a non-operational negative impact on discontinued
operations of around 200 million euros (234 million dollars). However, the
company’s continuing operations, which now mainly consist of the Adidas and
the Reebok brand, were not affected.
Adidas updates FY17 outlook
Due to the strong first half year performance, the company has increased
its 2017 financial outlook. Management now projects currency-neutral sales
to grow at a rate between 17 percent and 19 percent against previous
forecast of increase by between 12 percent and 14 percent compared to the
adjusted 2016 net sales of 18.483 billion euros (21.646 billion dollars)
for the company’s continuing operations).
Furthermore, the company forecasts a year-over-year gross margin
improvement during the second half and expects to continue to generate
operating leverage throughout the remainder of the year. As a result, net
income from continuing operations is now forecasted to increase at a rate
between 26 percent and 28 percent in 2017 to a level between 1.360 billion
euros (1.592 billion dollars) and 1.390 billion euros (1.627 billion
dollars). This compares to the original guidance as provided in March of an
increase of between 13 percent and 15 percent to a level between 1.200
billion euros (1.405 billion dollars) and 1.225 billion euros (1.434
billion dollars) for the company’s net income from continuing
operations.

Sports Direct increases stake in French Connection to 27 percent




Angela Gonzalez-Rodriguez |



Friday, July 28 2017 


Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct now owns a 27 percent stake in troubled
fashion retailer French Connection after buying shares from Gatemore
Capital and OTK, two of the fashion chain’s activist investors. 
As reported Thursday, Gatemore Capital and OTK, which held 8 percent and
7 percent stakes in French Connection respectively, have sold their entire
holdings in the business after trying to drive change in the fashion
retailer – even giving the CEO an ultimatum.
Activist investors gave up on trying to make French Connection’s CEO
change his mind
 “French Connection could have unlocked significantly more value during
the period had it made more progress in fixing its corporate governance.
French Connection remains a glaring example of the shortcomings of the UK
Corporate Governance Code: namely, that companies can get away with such
violations with zero repercussions to the people at the top,” Liad Meidar
managing partner at Gatemore told ‘The Telegraph’. 
After increasing its stake, Sports Direct has got closer than anyone
else to the 30 percent minimum stake required by law to trigger a takeover
bid. Actually, the sports apparel chain has enhanced its stake in the
fashion retailer’s equity from the 11 percent it first purchased last
February to this 27 percent. 
Back in June, Gatemore and OTK joined forces and demanded French
Connection’s CEO Stephen Marks to step down and consider other
opportunities to turnaround the business, even a sale. 
It’s worth recalling that Marks owns a 42 percent in the company and
that this the 
fifth consecutive year of losses for French Connection, which
widened its losses from 3.5 million to 5.3million pounds last year.

Deckers Brands posts Q1 sales growth of 20.3 percent




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 28 2017 


First quarter net sales at Deckers Brands increased 20.3 percent to
209.7 million dollars compared to 174.4 million dollars for the same period
last year. The year-over-year increase, the company said, was primarily due
to earlier than planned global wholesale shipments, an increase in
direct-to-consumer (DTC) comparable sales, and stronger than expected sales
in the Hoka One One brand. On a constant currency basis, net sales
increased 21.5 percent.
“Our first quarter results reflect solid consumer demand for our spring
product offering across our brands combined with earlier than planned
shipments of certain fall orders,” commented Dave Powers, President and CEO
in a statement, adding, “While it is still early in the year, we are
encouraged by our recent top-line performance.”
First quarter financial review
UGG brand net sales for the quarter increased 24.9 percent to 114.7
million dollars and on a constant currency basis, sales increased 26.6
percent.
Hoka One One brand net sales increased 74.2 percent to 30.7 million
dollars compared to 17.6 million dollars for the same period last year. On
a constant currency basis, sales increased 75.3 percent. Teva brand net
sales increased 8.6 percent to 37.7 million dollars, while on a constant
currency basis, sales increased 9.8 percent.
Sanuk brand net sales were 26.2 million dollars compared to 26.7 million
dollars for the same period last year, a decrease of 2 percent on both a
reported and constant currency basis driven by the transfer of a retail
store to a partner at the end of the last fiscal year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 43.2 percent compared to 43.7 percent
for the same period last year. The company added that gross margin was
slightly better than expected, and included an 80 basis point headwind from
changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Operating loss was 56.3 million dollars compared to 78.3 million dollars
for the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating loss was 54.3 million
dollars. Diluted loss per share was 1.32 dollars compared to 1.84 dollars
for the same period last year, while non-GAAP diluted loss per share was
1.28 dollars.
Sales performance by channel and geography
Wholesale net sales for the first quarter increased 24.5 percent to
144.6 million dollars and on a constant currency basis, sales increased
25.1 percent. DTC net sales increased 11.8 percent to 65.1 million dollars,
on a constant currency basis, sales increased 14.3 percent. DTC comparable
sales for the quarter increased 12.7 percent over the same period last
year.
Domestic net sales increased 10.2 percent to 120.7 million dollars
compared to 109.5 million dollars for the same period last year.
International net sales increased 37.2 percent to 89 million dollars
compared to 64.9 million dollars for the same period last year. On a
constant currency basis, sales increased 40.8 percent.
 Fiscal 2018 outlook reflect decline to flat sales growth
The company said, net sales are expected to be in the range of down 2
percent to flat and gross margin to be approximately 47.5 percent. Non-GAAP
diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 3.95 dollars
to 4.15 dollars, which excludes any charges that may occur from additional
store closures, restructuring and other charges.
The company expects second quarter fiscal 2018 net sales to be down
approximately 10 percent versus the same period last year, primarily as a
result of store closures, and the earlier than planned shipments in the
first quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be
approximately 1 dollar to 1.05 dollars compared to 1.23 dollars for the
same period last year.

Columbia Sportswear: Q2 net loss widens to 0.17 dollar per share




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 28 2017 


Columbia Sportswear Company announced second-quarter net sales of 398.9
million dollars, a 3 percent increase compared with the second quarter of
2016. Net loss totalled 11.5 million dollars or 0.17 dollar per share
compared to second quarter 2016 net loss of 8.2 million dollars or 0.12
dollar per share. For the first six months of 2017, the company’s net sales
grew 28.8 million dollars or 3 percent (4 percent constant-currency),
to 942.7 million dollars, while net income increased 4 percent, to 24.5
million dollars or 0.35 dollar per diluted share compared to 23.6 million
dollars or 0.33 dollar per diluted share.
Commenting on the results, President and CEO Tim Boyle said in a press
release: "We delivered solid first half financial results featuring growth
from three of our four brands and all four geographic regions. We have
embarked on ‘Project Connect’ from a position of strength, including a
current outlook that anticipates sales and earnings growth and a fortress
balance sheet with more than 600 million dollars in cash and no long-term
debt."
Financial highlights of the second quarter
Second quarter consolidated net sales increased 3 percent, driven by 4
percent net sales growth in the US to 238.2 million dollars, consisting of
mid-teen percentage growth in direct-to-consumer net sales, partially
offset by a high-single-digit percentage decline in wholesale net sales; 14
percent net sales growth in the EMEA region (16 percent constant-currency),
to 67.3 million dollars, including growth in net sales to EMEA distributors
and in the company's Europe-direct business; and 2 percent net sales growth
in Canada (5 percent constant-currency), to 13.9 million dollars. 
The sales growth, the company said, was partially offset by a 9 percent
net sales decline in the LAAP region (8 percent constant-currency), to 79.5
million dollars, primarily due to lower net sales in China and Korea.
Global Columbia brand net sales increased 2 percent (3 percent
constant-currency) to 340.5 million dollars, while Global Sorel brand net
sales increased 71 percent (74 percent constant-currency) to 6 million
dollars. Global prAna brand net sales increased 9 percent to 35 million
dollars and Global Mountain Hardwear brand net sales decreased 5 percent
to 16.1 million dollars.
Global apparel, accessories and equipment net sales increased 3 percent
to 329.7 million dollars, while global footwear net sales increased 3
percent (4 percent constant-currency) to 69.2 million dollars.
Second quarter loss from operations totalled 17.3 million dollars, or
(4.4) percent of net sales compared to 11.8 million dollars or 3 percent of
net sales, for the same period in 2016. Second quarter net loss
totalled 11.5 million dollars or 0.17 dollar per share compared with second
quarter 2016 net loss of 8.2 million dollars or 0.12 dollar per share.
The board of directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend
of 0.18 dollar per share, payable on August 31, 2017 to shareholders of
record on August 17, 2017.
Columbia Sportswear updates FY17 outlook
The company currently expects 2017 net sales growth of approximately 3
percent compared with 2016 net sales of 2.38 billion dollars, including
less than 1 percentage point negative effect from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. The company's US direct-to-consumer channel is
expected to account for a majority of the projected full year 2017 global
net sales increase.
The company expects gross margins to improve by approximately 30 basis
points and operating income to increase approximately 3 percent, to
between 256 million dollars and 265 million dollars, resulting in
anticipated 2017 operating margin of approximately 10.8 percent. Net income
after non-controlling interest is expected to increase up to 4 percent to
between approximately 193 million dollars and 200 million dollars, or
approximately 2.74 dollars to 2.84 dollars per diluted share.

Benneton Group doubles annual losses to 81 mn euros




Prachi Singh |



Wednesday, July 26 2017 


Benetton Group has not been able to recover from losses since last two
years and the trend continued in 2016 as well. The Italian group reported a
loss of 81 million euros (94 million dollars) against 46 million euros (53
million dollars), the company posted last year, says a Modaes report.
The company's sales declined 8 percent to 1.38 billion euros (1.60
billion dollars), which Benetton attributed to continued economic
stagnation in Europe and decline in sales of indirect sales channels as
well as poor performance of stores in Italy, France, Germany, Poland and
Turkey. However, the company believes that its ongoing transformation plan
will make a partial impact in 2017 but will manifest fully from the
spring-summer 2018, the report adds quoting a accounts filed by Edizione, which
controls 100 percent of Benetton Group.
As a part of its reorganization efforts, Benetton hired Marco
Airoldi as the new CEO in April 2014. It also closed over 300 stores and
currently operates around 5,000 stores. The company has also focussed its
energies on its two core brands - United Colors of Benetton and Sisley to
bring the company back into the black.

VF Corp invests 40 million USD to accelerate business growth




Vivian Hendriksz |



Tuesday, July 25 2017 



London - US retail group VF Corporation remans confident about its future -
so confident that it is set to invest an additional 40 million USD in its
business to fuel and accelerate its growth for 2018.


The announcement comes after VF Corp published strong results for its
second quarter, which surpassed analyst expectations. “We have really good
momentum as we move into the second half of 2017 and are confident in our
growth engines, as evidenced by an increase in our full year outlook and
our plan to increase our cash returns to shareholders,” said Steve Rendle,
President and Chief Executive Officer of VF Corp in a statement.


“Based on the strength of the first half of 2017 and our expectations for
the second half of the year, we are making
growth-focused investments in our largest brands and platforms to generate
additional value for our shareholders both in the near and long term.” VF
Corp aims to continue investigating what its largest growth opportunities
will be to create more momentum within its businesses. At the moment VF
Corp is currently focusing on streamlining its store portfolio by closing
stores which do not achieve full profitability, according to an interview
with WWD.


However, VF Corp is also set to open another 50 stores for the company’s
three biggest brands, Vans, Timberland and The North Face, as part of the
company’s five-year strategic plan, previously unveiled this March.
Improving VF Corp portfolio remains a key part of the company’s five-year
plan. “We think there are plenty of opportunities in the marketplace. We
are very active in that process,” said Rendle.
