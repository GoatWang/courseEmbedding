Vestar Capital Partners V LP’s affiliates (Mountain Acquisition Corp. and Mountain Merger Sub Corp.) and Health Grades Inc. agreed to extend the offer period for proposed $8.20 a share tender offer for all Health Grades’ shares. The offer’s new deadline is October 7 at 9 AM, New York City time.
PRESS RELEASE
Mountain Acquisition Corp. and Mountain Merger Sub Corp., both affiliates of Vestar Capital Partners V, L.P. (“Vestar”) formed for the purpose of acquiring Health Grades, Inc. (Nasdaq: HGRD) (“HealthGrades”), today announced the extension of the offer period for their previously announced tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of HealthGrades, at a purchase price of $8.20 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, until 9:00 AM, New York City time, on Thursday, October 7, 2010.
As previously announced, on August 10, 2010, Mountain Acquisition Corp. and Mountain Merger Sub Corp. commenced a tender offer for all outstanding shares of common stock of HealthGrades at a price of $8.20 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The tender offer was previously scheduled to expire at 9:00 AM, New York City time, on Thursday, September 16, 2010.
The depositary for the tender offer has advised that as of 5:00 PM, New York City time, on Wednesday, September 15, 2010, approximately 26,246,711 HealthGrades shares had been validly tendered and not withdrawn (excluding shares tendered by notices of guaranteed delivery). These shares, in addition to the restricted and option shares (net of withholding for taxes and costs of exercise) that are committed to be sold to Mountain Merger Sub Corp. pursuant to the previously disclosed support agreements with certain executives of HealthGrades, represent approximately 85.30% of the total outstanding shares of HealthGrades on a fully diluted basis, excluding certain shares to be issued pursuant to a non-competition agreement with one of the executives. Including the shares to be issued pursuant to such non-competition agreement, such tendered and committed shares represent approximately 90.19% of the total outstanding shares of HealthGrades on a fully-diluted basis, such that Mountain Merger Sub Corp. would be permitted to consummate a “short-form” merger under Delaware law. Excluding shares tendered pursuant to the support agreements, the tendered shares represent approximately 71.42% of the total outstanding shares on a fully-diluted basis, excluding certain shares to be issued pursuant to the non-competition agreement, and approximately 87.38% of all shares not subject to support agreements. 





On Wednesday, September 15, 2010, HealthGrades, Mountain Acquisition Corp. and Mountain Merger Sub Corp. entered into a memorandum of understanding which outlines the general terms of a settlement reached in the purported class action lawsuits filed in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware related to the proposed acquisition of HealthGrades. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, which remains subject to approval by the Delaware Court of Chancery, HealthGrades, Mountain Acquisition Corp. and Mountain Merger Sub Corp. agreed to the extension of the tender offer and certain other modifications to the merger agreement and tender and support agreements with certain HealthGrades executives. Notwithstanding Vestar’s belief that the allegations made by the plaintiffs in such lawsuits are without merit and that the process leading to the commencement of the tender offer was conducted in a fair and appropriate manner and in compliance with applicable law, Vestar concluded that ongoing litigation would have been a significant distraction in the operation of HealthGrades’ business during the important initial period of Vestar’s investment and that reaching a non-cash settlement is fair and reasonable to all concerned under the circumstances. Vestar has not been notified that HealthGrades received any inquiries from another party with respect to a competing acquisition proposal, and Vestar continues to be firmly committed to consummating the acquisition pursuant to the extended offer and will continue to work with HealthGrades to that end.

Vestar Capital Partners V LP’s affiliates (Mountain Acquisition Corp. and Mountain Merger Sub Corp.) and Health Grades Inc. agreed to extend the offer period for proposed $8.20 a share tender offer for all Health Grades’ shares. The offer’s new deadline is September 16 at 9 AM, New York City time.
PRESS RELEASE
Mountain Acquisition Corp. and Mountain Merger Sub Corp., affiliates of Vestar Capital Partners V, L.P. (“Vestar”) formed for the purpose of acquiring Health Grades, Inc. (Nasdaq: HGRD) (“HealthGrades”), and HealthGrades today announced the extension of the offer period for the previously announced tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of HealthGrades, at a purchase price of $8.20 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, until 9:00 AM, New York City time, on Thursday, September 16, 2010.
As announced previously, on August 10, 2010, Mountain Acquisition Corp. and Mountain Merger Sub Corp. commenced a tender offer for all outstanding shares of common stock of HealthGrades at a price of $8.20 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The tender offer was previously set to expire at 9:00 AM, New York City time, on Friday, September 10, 2010.
The depositary for the tender offer has advised that as of 5:00 PM, New York City time, on Thursday, September 9, 2010, approximately 26,298,372 HealthGrades shares had been validly tendered and not withdrawn (excluding shares tendered by notices of guaranteed delivery). These shares, in addition to the restricted and option shares (net of withholding for taxes and costs of exercise) that are committed to be sold to Mountain Merger Sub Corp. pursuant to the previously disclosed support agreements with certain executives, represent approximately 89.8% of the total outstanding shares of HealthGrades on a fully diluted basis, excluding certain shares to be issued pursuant to a non-competition agreement with one of the executives. Including the shares to be issued pursuant to such non-competition agreement, such tendered and committed shares represent approximately 90.3% of the total outstanding shares of HealthGrades on a fully diluted basis, such that Mountain Merger Sub Corp. would be permitted to consummate a “short-form” merger under Delaware law. Excluding shares tendered pursuant to the support agreements, the tendered shares represent approximately 71.5% of the total outstanding shares on a fully-diluted basis, excluding certain shares to be issued pursuant to a non-competition agreement with one of the executives, and approximately 87.6% of all shares not subject to support agreements. Except for the extension of the expiration date of the tender offer, all other terms and conditions of the tender offer remain unchanged. 





The parties have agreed to amend the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger, among Mountain Merger Sub Corp., Mountain Acquisition Corp., Mountain Acquisition Holdings, LLC, and HealthGrades, dated July 27, 2010, as amended on August 9, 2010, to extend the offer in order to provide the parties and HealthGrades’ stockholders with additional time to continue to evaluate their alternatives and potential actions in light of the ruling issued by the Delaware Court of Chancery on September 3, 2010 in the action styled In re Health Grades, Inc. Shareholders Litigation, which ruling was previously disclosed by Vestar and its affiliates and by HealthGrades in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, as amended, Vestar and HealthGrades remain committed to consummating the tender offer and the merger.
