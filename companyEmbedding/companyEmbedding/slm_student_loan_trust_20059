                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision.

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Float Rate Cl. A Notes, Confirmed at Aaa (sf); previously 
on Jun 22, 2015 Aaa (sf) Placed Under Review for Possible Downgrade






RATINGS RATIONALE 




Some of the notes in today's rating actions were placed on watch 
in June 2016 in connection with the application of Moody's updated 
FFELP methodology. Under the new methodology, Moody's 
derives the expected loss of each tranche by running its standard 28 cash 
flow scenarios and using the weights associated with each scenario.




The downgrades are primarily the result of Moody's analysis that indicates 
that the tranches will not pay off by their final maturity dates under 
some or all of 28 cash flow scenarios, thus causing the tranches 
to incur expected losses that are higher than the expected loss benchmarks 
set in Moody's Idealized Cumulative Expected Loss Rates table for the 
previous ratings. The low payment rates on the underlying securitized 
pools of FFELP student loans are driven primarily by persistently high 
levels of loans to borrowers in non-standard payment plans, 
including deferment, forbearance and Income-Based Repayment 
(IBR), as well as by the relatively low rates of voluntary prepayments.




The downgrades of Class B notes in SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-2, 
2003-5 and 2003-10 also reflect significant excess spread 
compression under some or all of 28 cash flow scenarios. Because 
these transactions have a significant portion of auction-rate securities 
or reset-rate notes, whose coupon rates increased as a result 
of failed auctions or failed remarketing, respectively, their 
excess spread has declined considerably. Under some or all of our 
scenarios these transactions would pay out more interest than the underlying 
collateral generates, which would then erode the collateral base 
and cause the transactions to become undercollateralized. As a 
result, the Class B notes may not be fully repaid by their final 
maturity dates.




For transactions with exposure to cross currency swaps, Moody's 
incorporated the risk of additional losses on the notes in the event that 
they become unhedged following a swap counterparty default. Moody's 
also took into account structural features of the transactions that may 
reduce the impact of such disruption.




The downgrades of some lowest payment priority Class A notes result in 
these notes being rated lower than the subordinated Class B notes in the 
affected securitizations. Although transaction structures stipulate 
that Class B interest is diverted to pay Class A principal upon default 
on the Class A notes, Moody's analysis indicates that the cash flow 
available to make payments on the Class B notes will be sufficient to 
make all required payments to Class B noteholders by the Class B final 
maturity dates, which occur much later than the final maturity dates 
of the downgraded Class A notes.




The upgrades and confirmations are primarily the result of Moody's analysis 
that indicates that these tranches are either likely to successfully pay 
off by their maturity dates, or that the expected loss for each 
such tranche is lower than or consistent with, respectively, 
the expected loss benchmark levels set in Moody's Idealized Cumulative 
Expected Loss Rates table for the previous ratings.




The confirmation of Class A-6 in SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-2 
and the upgrade of Class B notes in SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-7 
and 2004-10 also reflect the correction of an error in calculating 
the amount of investment earnings on cash residing in each transaction's 
collection account before each distribution date. In our May 27, 
2016 and June 14, 2016 actions, we mistakenly assumed that 
interest collections from each of the collateral loan pools for these 
transactions generate zero investment earnings, when in fact they 
generate investment earnings at the same rate as principal collections 
from the collateral loan pools. As a result of the correction, 
cash available for distribution on each distribution date has increased 
and the expected loss for these tranches has reduced to a level consistent 
with (for Class A-6 in SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-2) or 
lower than (for the Class B notes in SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-7 
and 2004-10) the expected loss benchmark levels set in Moody's 
Idealized Cumulative Expected Loss Rates table for the previous ratings.




In its rating actions Moody's also considered Navient's demonstrated willingness 
and ability to protect the securities from being in default as of their 
final maturity dates. Specifically, Navient has consistently 
exercised its option to purchase all remaining student loans from the 
trusts at or below the 10% pool factor and pay off the notes. 
Navient has also amended 34 transactions to add the ability to purchase 
an additional 10% of the initial pool balance. In the event 
that Navient does not exercise the option to purchase the loans at 10% 
pool factor, the Indenture trustee may initiate a sale of the underlying 
student loan pools, which will take place only if proceeds from 
the sale will be sufficient to pay off all outstanding notes. Navient 
has also amended some transactions to establish a revolving credit facility 
that enables the trust to borrow money from Navient Corporation on a subordinated 
basis in order to pay off the notes. Finally, Navient amended 
26 transactions to extend maturity dates for tranches that appeared to 
have significant risk of not paying off within the previous final maturities.




Today's actions reflect Moody's assumption that the events giving rise 
to non-recurring fees and expenses that the Indenture trustee might 
sustain, as a result of litigation or other unforeseen circumstances, 
are not likely to occur during the term of the transactions, as 
evidenced by historical experience in the transactions backed by FFELP 
student loans. Therefore, Moody's has not included such fees 
and expenses in its cash flow modeling analysis. To account for 
a small probability of such events, however, Moody's qualitatively 
assessed sufficiency of the cash flows to pay the trustees' non-recurring 
fees and expenses. This analysis focused in particular on estimating 
the amount of residual cash flows generated by the pools of student loans 
after their balance declines to 10% of the initial balance (10% 
pool factor), at which time the pools are expected to generate significantly 
diminished amounts of cash to cover those non-recurring fees and 
expenses.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Moody's Approach 
to Rating Securities Backed by FFELP Student Loans" published in August 
2016. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology. 




Up




Moody's could upgrade the ratings if tranches final maturities are extended, 
the paydown speed of the loan pool increases as a result of lower than 
expected borrower usage of deferment, forbearance and IBR, 
higher than expected voluntary prepayment rates, or prepayments 
with proceeds from sponsor repurchases of student loan collateral. 
Moody's could also upgrade the rating owing to a build-up in credit 
enhancement, or an improvement of the credit quality of the swap 
providers.




Down




Moody's could downgrade the ratings if the paydown speed of the loan pool 
declines as a result of lower than voluntary prepayments, and higher 
than expected deferment, forbearance and IBR rates, which 
would threaten full repayment of the classes by their final maturity dates. 
Moody's could also downgrade the rating if the protection from Navient 
is not materialized within a reasonable time frame, or the credit 
quality of the swap providers deteriorate.




In addition, because the US Department of Education guarantees at 
least 97% of principal and accrued interest on defaulted loans, 
Moody's could downgrade the ratings of the notes if it were to downgrade 
the rating on the United States government.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




In rating this transaction, Moody's used a cash flow model 
to model cash flow stress scenarios to determine the extent to which investors 
would receive timely payments of interest and principal in the stress 
scenarios, given the transaction structure and collateral composition.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms Senior Notes of SLM 2005-9; Downgrades Subs | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Senior Notes of SLM 2005-9; Downgrades Subs
    





December 01, 2016 03:13 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions on SLM Student Loan 
      Trust 2005-9 (SLM 2005-9):
    

      --Class A-6 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-7A affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-7B affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B downgraded to 'BBBsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch has increased its default base case to 16.25% from 15.25% due to 
      underperformance compared to original expectations in recent years, and 
      the expectation that this negative trend will continue in the near 
      future. As a result the class B notes fail Fitch's 'A' credit stress 
      scenario.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      U.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral comprises 100% Federal Family 
      Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, with guaranties provided by 
      eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of 
      Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. The 
      U.S. sovereign rating is currently 'AAA'/Outlook Stable.
    

      Collateral Performance: Fitch assumes a base case default rate of 16.25% 
      and a 49% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress scenario, which is 
      based on Fitch's default model and reflective of recent actual 
      performance. The claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base 
      case and 3% in the 'AAA' case. Fitch applies the standard default timing 
      curve in its credit stress cash flow analysis. The trailing 12-month 
      (TTM) average constant default rate, utilized in the maturity stresses, 
      is 2.2%. TTM levels of deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment 
      (prior to adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary and 
      involuntary) are 5.6%, 8.8%, 8.6%, and 7.1%, respectively, and are used 
      as the starting point in cash flow modelling. Subsequent declines or 
      increases are modelled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed 
      to be approximately 0.23%, based on information provided by the sponsor.
    

      Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and 
      interest rate stresses to this transaction as per criteria.
    

      Payment Structure: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by excess spread 
      and, for the class A notes, subordination. As of September 2016, total 
      and senior effective parity ratios (including the reserve) are 100% and 
      104.68% (4.47% CE). Both class A and B are receiving principal, since 
      the step-down date of January 2011 has passed. Liquidity support is 
      provided by a reserve equal to its floor of $4,531,704. The transaction 
      will continue to release cash as long as the target parity ratio of 100% 
      (including the reserve, until pool factor is below 40%) is maintained.
    

      Maturity Risk: Fitch's SLABS cash flow model indicates that the notes 
      are paid in full on or prior to the legal final maturity dates under the 
      commensurate rating scenario.
    

      Operational Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by Navient 
      Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Sallie Mae, Inc.). Fitch believes 
      Navient to be an acceptable servicer, due to its extensive track record 
      as the largest servicer of FFELP loans.
    

      CRITERIA VARIATIONS
    

      Under the 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds', dated July 18, 2016, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing 
      counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The 
      definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the 
      possibility of using investments not rated by Fitch, which represents a 
      criteria variation. Since the only available funds to invest in are 
      those held in the Collection Account, and the funds can only be invested 
      for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the 
      notes, Fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact 
      upon the ratings assigned.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      'AAAsf' rated tranches of most FFELP securitizations will likely move in 
      tandem with the U.S. sovereign rating, given the strong linkage to the 
      U.S. sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and SAP provided by ED. 
      Sovereign risks are not addressed in Fitch's sensitivity analysis.
    

      Fitch conducted a CE sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related 
      lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions. In addition, Fitch 
      conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different 
      assumptions for the IBR usage and prepayment rate. The results below 
      should only be considered as one potential model implied outcome as the 
      transaction is exposed to multiple risk factors that are all dynamic 
      variables.
    

      Credit Stress Rating Sensitivity
    

      --Default increase 25%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'BBBsf'
    

      --Default increase 50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'BBsf'
    

      --Basis Spread increase 0.25%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'BBBsf'
    

      --Basis Spread increase 0.50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'BBBsf'
    

      Maturity Stress Rating Sensitivity
    

      --CPR decrease 50%: class A 'AAAf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      --CPR increase 100%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      --IBR Usage increase 100%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      --IBR Usage decrease 50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia
