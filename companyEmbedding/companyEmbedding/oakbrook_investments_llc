Strategies
OakBrook's "Different Way of Thinking" is reflected in the investment strategies we offer. Our three principals believe that high quality, independent research leads to superior investment results. Sound economic theory forms the basis for OakBrook's original, and highly respected, investment research.
Our research leads to investment strategies that are as compelling as they are different from more conventional approaches. For example, our Select Equity strategy focuses on companies that possess a trait economists refer to as "Market Power". OakBrook's family of  Quantitative strategies makes use of "Auction Theory" for stock selection. This economics-based perspective has also led to exciting new insights into styles of investment management. By applying proprietary research, we have built an innovative family of Style Indices that offer a highly efficient means of gaining exposure to a variety of investment styles. Our  Small Cap strategy utilizes these style indices to identify stocks likely to underperform in the long run and eliminate them from client portfolios in a style neutral fashion.


Quantitative Management

 Our Quantitative strategies bring together the best aspects of both passive and active management. Any active management style will go through periods of substantial over and under performance relative to a benchmark, while passive management merely seeks to replicate benchmark performance.  These strategies combine the best of each to add value over and above index year after year.
OakBrook’s quantitative, stock based approach is distinctive, repeatable and can enhance the performance of virtually any index. Dispensing with the common tactics of factor analysis and optimization, it bases its success on two components: a two-factor stock selection model with a firm underpinning in economic theory and a unique set of risk controls. OakBrook's  Quantitative strategies can be targeted to expected annual excess returns ranging from 0.50% to 2% gross of fees with information ratios near 1. Several large and mid capitalization US benchmarks are offered including S&P 500, Russell 1000, Russell 1000 Growth and Value, and Russell Mid Cap 800.

Market Neutral

OakBrook offers a long/short Market Neutral Strategy that employs the same quantitative stock selection model as used in OakBrook’s family of enhanced index strategies. The model is applied to a universe of 250 domestic large cap stocks. A rigorous portfolio construction process is then implemented to create a portfolio that is dollar neutral, style neutral and volatility neutral.
The portfolio’s value added is a function of the return spread between the long and short positions. The goal of Market Neutral is to outperform 3-month T-Bills by 3%-6% over time, after fees, with return volatility comparable to bonds. The returns of the strategy are expected to have little or no correlation with those of other asset classes.

Benefits

Disclosures



 Small Cap

OakBrook's  Small Cap Strategy utilizes a proprietary style classification system to identify a group of overpriced small cap stocks and exclude them from client portfolios in a style neutral fashion. Benchmark relative gains from excluding the overpriced stocks are augmented by decisions to overweight or underweight stocks on the basis of return momentum.
The strategy is expected to outperform the S&P 600 Index by an average of 4% to 6% per year gross of fees with an information ratio greater than 0.5.
Portfolio Managers

 Peter Jankovskis, PhD, CFA
 Janna Sampson, CFA
 Giri Cherukuri, CFA
 Paula Mikrut, CFA

Benefits


Well-diversified portfolio typically holding 125 to 165 stocks
Lower fees than pure active management


Disclosures



Select Equity

OakBrook’s Select Equity Strategy is built upon an economic concept called “Market Power”. Companies with Market Power possess both dominant market share and barrier(s) to entry. Entry barriers can take several forms including patents, brand recognition, economies of scale and several others. Companies with Market Power effectively enjoy a shield from competition, which protects market share, longer-term profitability and promotes creation of long-term shareholder value. Shares of these leading companies are purchased when OakBrook considers them undervalued by the market. The strategy’s goal is to outperform the S&P 500 by 3%-4% over the investment cycle, while not exposing investors to additional risk. Due to the conservative, defensive nature of stocks held in the portfolio, Select Equity offers its best relative performance during stable, declining or highly volatile markets, while typically lagging somewhat during rising markets.
Portfolio Managers

  Janna Sampson, CFA
  Peter Jankovskis, PhD, CFA

Benefits

Long term history of delivering high alpha
  
Attractive down market performance
Excellent long term performance (gross of fees) 


Focused on long run profitability rather that short term earnings
  
Lowers portfolio turnover
Improves performance over the market cycle


Low correlation to aggressive growth, value and private equity
  
Combines best attributes of growth and value styles
Complements other equity strategies well
Provides smoothing effect to total plan performance

Style Indices

Everyone has experienced the cyclicality of growth and value managers. But why is it that not all value managers, for example, move in lockstep with one another? Through years of research we have identified another factor, a third dimension to style that is so powerful, it deserves to be a style classification in its own right.
This factor is the stability of a stock’s past returns relative to other stocks and is the basis for our Stable and Variable style groups. Both these groups offer a sharp distinction in performance. Categorizing stocks on the basis of the stability of returns represents a powerful extension of the conventional value and growth framework, enhancing the ability of our indices to distinguish growth from value stocks.
Failure to consider this factor can lead to underperformance. We have found that most equity managers are either Stable Value or Variable Growth, thereby leaving two significant style gaps – Stable Growth and Variable Value – that can be filled with our indices to improve the diversification of overall equity portfolios.
Four Improved Style Groups – Pure and Powerful

                                      	Most of today’s leading style indices are indeed watered down, holding too many stocks that don’t capture the true characteristics of the style they are meant to represent. And when indices become diluted, they fail to demonstrate the return pattern of their style as they move through the business cycle. OakBrook’s Style Indices instead only include those stocks in each group that demonstrate the strongest characteristics. The benefit is that each of our four style indices has pure style properties.
Whether used as complements or enhancements to other styles, these indices are powerful tools. Stable Growth and Variable Value styles are under represented in most institutional portfolios and the indices can be used to gain exposure to these styles. Or, Stable Growth and Stable Value can be combined to form a Stable Equity Index, one which offers very attractive defensive properties.

New Enhanced Index Products launched by OakBrook Investments, LLC



Share Article




















(PRWEB)
November 19, 2000
 Lisle, IL, November 9, 2000 - OakBrook Investments, LLC is expanding its lineup of enhanced index products.  Joining the successful OakBrook Enhanced Index are three new products: OakBrook Enhanced Large Cap Value, OakBrook Enhanced Large Cap Growth, and OakBrook Enhanced Top 1000.  ÂAll three products rely on the auction theory based stock selection methodology utilized in OakBrookÂs Enhanced Index product to augment S&P 500 Index returns.  This methodology is then combined with OakBrookÂs three level risk control system to limit tracking error to approximately 1%,Â said Dr. Neil Wright, President and Chief Investment Officer.  Dr. Wright and his partners at OakBrook have managed enhanced index portfolios benchmarked to the S&P 500 Index for more than 5 years.  
The OakBrook Enhanced Large Cap Value is benchmarked to the S&P/BARRA Value Index, OakBrook Enhanced Large Cap Growth is benchmarked to the S&P/BARRA Growth Index, and the OakBrook Enhanced Top 1000 is benchmarked to an index of the 1000 largest US companies constructed by OakBrook.  All seek to achieve a gross excess return of 1% to 2% with an annualized tracking error of approximately 1%.  OakBrook began managing a $6.3 million Enhanced Large Cap Value account on September 29.
ÂInitial results have been exceptional, with the account well on its way toward achieving OakBrookÂs goal of out performing the S&P/BARRA Value Index by 1% to 2% over a full year,Â said Janna Sampson, Director of Portfolio Management.  OakBrook plans to market these products to national and regional consultants as well as directly to plan sponsors.
Enhanced index strategies bring together the best aspects of active and passive management, offering the possibility of out performing a benchmark while at the same time providing tight tracking.  Enhanced index strategies often employ highly structured, risk controlled approaches designed to prevent the substantial under performance that can occur with more aggressive active approaches. A modest level of out performance gives them an edge over purely passive strategies that seek only to replicate benchmark performance and risk profiles.
OakBrook Investments, LLC is a registered investment advisor specializing in managing large-cap institutional equities and mutual funds. OakBrook sub-advises two mutual funds, the AmSouth Select Equity Fund (Ticker: ASECX) and the AmSouth Enhanced Market Fund (Ticker: AMEMX).  The Enhanced Market Fund utilizes OakBrookÂs Enhanced Index Strategy and is benchmarked to the S&P 500 Index.
The S&P 500 Index is a registered trademark of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.  The S&P/BARRA Indices are registered trademarks of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. and BARRA RogersCasey.  The S&P/BARRA Indices are unmanaged portfolios derived from the S&P 500 Index, which is itself an unmanaged portfolio of 500 widely held stocks.  OakBrook Investments is not affiliated in any way with either McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. or BARRA RogersCasey.
