History[edit]
Wahaha has its origins in the sales department of the Shangcheng District School in Hangzhou, which was founded in 1987. A factory, the "Hangzhou Wahaha Nutritional Foods Factory" (杭州娃哈哈營養食品廠), was created in 1989 to tap a niche in the market for a "children's liquid nutrient" 兒童營養口服液.[3] Although there were 38 producers of liquid nutrients on the market, none were specifically for children. The advertising campaign struck a note with single child Chinese parents, and was a runaway success.[3] In 1991, the factory was merged with the ailing "Hangzhou Canned Food Factory" (杭州罐头食品厂) in a social restructuring, but which increased the overheads of the business.[4]
In May 1992, Wahaha raised CNY236 million internally in order to start the Hangzhou Wahaha Food City Co. Ltd. (杭州娃哈哈美食城股份有限公司), and to finance the construction of Wahaha Food City, in Hangzhou.[4] Due to inexperience in project management, cashflow became a problem, as construction was delayed for 6 years.[4] This company holds the interests of the employees' union. It changed its name to ZHI at an EGM in August 2001.
During the period from 1992 to 1994, WHH shifted the company away from health drinks to other products. During this period it launched a sour plum drink, alcoholic beverages and pseudo-medicinal potions, but these would successively fail.[4]
In 1994, the company acquired three insolvent companies in Sichuan, and established its first factory in Chongqing. A local manufacturing base enabled the company to reduce distribution costs to western China.[2] Once talks had started with Danone, capital became available once again for the company. WHH launched Wahaha Pure Water and struck gold with it.[4] Over the next three years, WHH would acquire 40 more companies in 22 different provincial cities, transforming it into one of the largest beverage companies in China.
Joint ventures[edit]
Main article: Wahaha Joint Venture Company
In 1995, Peregrine Investments Holdings introduced Zong to Danone, and discussions about the creation of a joint venture began. The Wahaha trademark was assigned to the main joint venture vehicle on 29 February 1996, and a joint venture agreement was eventually signed on 28 March 1996.[4]
The "foreign partners" took 51%, while the "Chinese partners" held 49% (of which WHH holds 39% and employees own 10%).[4] Groupe Danone and Peregrine together invested US$70 million in return for the stake in five joint venture WHH companies[1] with the exclusive rights of production, distribution and sales of products under the Wahaha brand.[5] When Peregrine collapsed in 1998, Groupe DANONE acquired its stake in the JVs, and became majority owner.
The business had grown into 39 joint venture entities by 2007,[6] and the total injected capital amounts to USD131 million.[4]
Since April 2007, Wahaha has been engaged in a public dispute with Danone, its JV partner. Danone has accused Zong of selling identical products using the Wahaha brand outside of the joint ventures, and demands a 51% stake in these.[6] The matter was closed on 30 September 2009.
Going it alone[edit]
Since the dispute began, Wahaha has launched products under different brands. Earlier the company released new beverage products under the name of Nutri-Express Drink and Wahaha Smoothie. U-Yo Milk Coffee has now been launched with a "Qili" logo. The producer was a new company rather than the Wahaha Group. More products are likely to be rebranded with the new logo.[7]
Products and distribution[edit]




Maoyuan Coffee is a canned coffee beverage manufactured by the Hangzhou Wahaha Group


Wahaha branded products include milk drinks (19%), soft drinks, bottled water (43%), bottled tea (19%), fruit juice (13%), porridges and its flagship yoghurt beverages (7%).[8]
Its largest facility is located in Hangzhou's Xiasha Economic and Technological Development Zone, where one-third of the company's production occurs.[2]
Wahaha dealers help them with management and marketing and advertises nationally. The company has 35 provincial sales offices, 2,500 sales team employees, Its distribution is truly nationwide. Wahaha is one of 3 brands which has few distribution gaps in rural China, with more than 2 million sales outlets across the country.[2] Distributors are responsible for capital, storage, and delivery. The company maintains two grades of distributors: more than 1,500 first-level dealers that need to meet distribution targets and manage large networks and capital; and 12,000 second-level dealers that deal at smaller levels.[2] Distributors' franchise areas are strictly delimited to ensure no poaching between areas, and are guaranteed by forfeitable deposits lodged with Wahaha.
The distribution has given "Future Cola" a close third in national market share through its domination of rural China, its tertiary and secondary cities. According to PRC government statistics, Coca-Cola held a 24 percent market share in 2003,[2] whilst Future Cola's market share is 70% of that of Pepsi.
Its products are also available in major Chinatowns.
Ownership structure[edit]
Holding company[edit]
The Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. Ltd. is 29.4% owned Zong, 26.4% by the employees and management as represented by Zhejiang Wahaha Industries Joint-stock Co. ("ZHI") (浙江娃哈哈实业股份有限公司), and 46% by Shangcheng District Government.[4] Zong's shares are controlled by British Virgin Islands registered Ever Maple Trading Ltd. (恒枫) through Hangzhou Hongsheng Beverage Co Ltd (杭州娃哈哈广盛投资公司).[9] Ever Maple's legal representative is Zong's daughter Zong Fuli.[10]
Other "Wahaha companies"[edit]
Whilst the group has many subsidiaries, both local and foreign registered, there are also a number of entities which are essentially private companies owned or controlled by Zong. These companies are the subject of the dispute with the foreign partner. At the end of 2006, total non-joint venture companies reportedly had equity of ¥5.6 billion and profits of ¥1.04 billion. In December, Zong had agreed to sell these to Danone for ¥4 billion.[11]
The Hangzhou Wahaha Guangsheng Investment Co. (杭州娃哈哈广盛投资有限公司) ("GUANGSHENG") established in 2003 with registered capital of ¥50 million, is a key non-JV entity. Its shares were held by Zong and the union in a ratio of 60:40. Its capital was later increased to ¥80 million. The following companies, inter alia, were its subsidiaries or associates, with holdings ranging from 39 to 60 percent:[12]

Hangzhou Wahaha Children's Clothing Co. 杭州娃哈哈童装有限公司, est. 2002
Changsha Wahaha Beverages Co. 长沙娃哈哈饮料有限公司
Harbin Shuangcheng Wahaha Foods Co. 哈尔滨双城娃哈哈食品有限公司
Jian Wahaha Beverages Co. 吉安娃哈哈饮料公司

The shares of Hangzhou Wahaha Children's Clothing Co. (杭州娃哈哈童装有限公司) founded in 2002, were initially held by Guangsheng, but were transferred out in August 2003, in an "interesting series of share transfers". It is now 65% owned by Zong, 10% by his wife, and 25% by Platinum Net Ltd.[12]
The Hangzhou Wahaha Food and Beverage Sales Co. (杭州娃哈哈食品饮料营销有限公司) "WHHFBSC", registered on 19 December 2006, is an external company allegedly now the centre of a parallel distribution network.[10] 10% of its share capital is held by Zong's wife, Shi Youzhen, and 90% by Ever Maple Trading Ltd.[10]
Zong set up non-jv owned factories, such as the Hangzhou Xiushan Shunfa Packaging Co. (杭州萧山顺发食品包装公司),[10] to manufacture or pack products identical to WHH. Danone alleges that distributors were asked to set up new bank accounts for their deposit payments in the name of WHHFBSC to sell products from these factories.[13]
Offshore companies[edit]
These offshore companies have been reported as being subsidiaries of the Wahaha Group, and have been seized in their respective domiciles:[14]

History[edit]
Wahaha has its origins in the sales department of the Shangcheng District School in Hangzhou, which was founded in 1987. A factory, the "Hangzhou Wahaha Nutritional Foods Factory" (杭州娃哈哈營養食品廠), was created in 1989 to tap a niche in the market for a "children's liquid nutrient" 兒童營養口服液.[3] Although there were 38 producers of liquid nutrients on the market, none were specifically for children. The advertising campaign struck a note with single child Chinese parents, and was a runaway success.[3] In 1991, the factory was merged with the ailing "Hangzhou Canned Food Factory" (杭州罐头食品厂) in a social restructuring, but which increased the overheads of the business.[4]
In May 1992, Wahaha raised CNY236 million internally in order to start the Hangzhou Wahaha Food City Co. Ltd. (杭州娃哈哈美食城股份有限公司), and to finance the construction of Wahaha Food City, in Hangzhou.[4] Due to inexperience in project management, cashflow became a problem, as construction was delayed for 6 years.[4] This company holds the interests of the employees' union. It changed its name to ZHI at an EGM in August 2001.
During the period from 1992 to 1994, WHH shifted the company away from health drinks to other products. During this period it launched a sour plum drink, alcoholic beverages and pseudo-medicinal potions, but these would successively fail.[4]
In 1994, the company acquired three insolvent companies in Sichuan, and established its first factory in Chongqing. A local manufacturing base enabled the company to reduce distribution costs to western China.[2] Once talks had started with Danone, capital became available once again for the company. WHH launched Wahaha Pure Water and struck gold with it.[4] Over the next three years, WHH would acquire 40 more companies in 22 different provincial cities, transforming it into one of the largest beverage companies in China.
Joint ventures[edit]
Main article: Wahaha Joint Venture Company
In 1995, Peregrine Investments Holdings introduced Zong to Danone, and discussions about the creation of a joint venture began. The Wahaha trademark was assigned to the main joint venture vehicle on 29 February 1996, and a joint venture agreement was eventually signed on 28 March 1996.[4]
The "foreign partners" took 51%, while the "Chinese partners" held 49% (of which WHH holds 39% and employees own 10%).[4] Groupe Danone and Peregrine together invested US$70 million in return for the stake in five joint venture WHH companies[1] with the exclusive rights of production, distribution and sales of products under the Wahaha brand.[5] When Peregrine collapsed in 1998, Groupe DANONE acquired its stake in the JVs, and became majority owner.
The business had grown into 39 joint venture entities by 2007,[6] and the total injected capital amounts to USD131 million.[4]
Since April 2007, Wahaha has been engaged in a public dispute with Danone, its JV partner. Danone has accused Zong of selling identical products using the Wahaha brand outside of the joint ventures, and demands a 51% stake in these.[6] The matter was closed on 30 September 2009.
Going it alone[edit]
Since the dispute began, Wahaha has launched products under different brands. Earlier the company released new beverage products under the name of Nutri-Express Drink and Wahaha Smoothie. U-Yo Milk Coffee has now been launched with a "Qili" logo. The producer was a new company rather than the Wahaha Group. More products are likely to be rebranded with the new logo.[7]
Products and distribution[edit]




Maoyuan Coffee is a canned coffee beverage manufactured by the Hangzhou Wahaha Group


Wahaha branded products include milk drinks (19%), soft drinks, bottled water (43%), bottled tea (19%), fruit juice (13%), porridges and its flagship yoghurt beverages (7%).[8]
Its largest facility is located in Hangzhou's Xiasha Economic and Technological Development Zone, where one-third of the company's production occurs.[2]
Wahaha dealers help them with management and marketing and advertises nationally. The company has 35 provincial sales offices, 2,500 sales team employees, Its distribution is truly nationwide. Wahaha is one of 3 brands which has few distribution gaps in rural China, with more than 2 million sales outlets across the country.[2] Distributors are responsible for capital, storage, and delivery. The company maintains two grades of distributors: more than 1,500 first-level dealers that need to meet distribution targets and manage large networks and capital; and 12,000 second-level dealers that deal at smaller levels.[2] Distributors' franchise areas are strictly delimited to ensure no poaching between areas, and are guaranteed by forfeitable deposits lodged with Wahaha.
The distribution has given "Future Cola" a close third in national market share through its domination of rural China, its tertiary and secondary cities. According to PRC government statistics, Coca-Cola held a 24 percent market share in 2003,[2] whilst Future Cola's market share is 70% of that of Pepsi.
Its products are also available in major Chinatowns.
Ownership structure[edit]
Holding company[edit]
The Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. Ltd. is 29.4% owned Zong, 26.4% by the employees and management as represented by Zhejiang Wahaha Industries Joint-stock Co. ("ZHI") (浙江娃哈哈实业股份有限公司), and 46% by Shangcheng District Government.[4] Zong's shares are controlled by British Virgin Islands registered Ever Maple Trading Ltd. (恒枫) through Hangzhou Hongsheng Beverage Co Ltd (杭州娃哈哈广盛投资公司).[9] Ever Maple's legal representative is Zong's daughter Zong Fuli.[10]
Other "Wahaha companies"[edit]
Whilst the group has many subsidiaries, both local and foreign registered, there are also a number of entities which are essentially private companies owned or controlled by Zong. These companies are the subject of the dispute with the foreign partner. At the end of 2006, total non-joint venture companies reportedly had equity of ¥5.6 billion and profits of ¥1.04 billion. In December, Zong had agreed to sell these to Danone for ¥4 billion.[11]
The Hangzhou Wahaha Guangsheng Investment Co. (杭州娃哈哈广盛投资有限公司) ("GUANGSHENG") established in 2003 with registered capital of ¥50 million, is a key non-JV entity. Its shares were held by Zong and the union in a ratio of 60:40. Its capital was later increased to ¥80 million. The following companies, inter alia, were its subsidiaries or associates, with holdings ranging from 39 to 60 percent:[12]

Hangzhou Wahaha Children's Clothing Co. 杭州娃哈哈童装有限公司, est. 2002
Changsha Wahaha Beverages Co. 长沙娃哈哈饮料有限公司
Harbin Shuangcheng Wahaha Foods Co. 哈尔滨双城娃哈哈食品有限公司
Jian Wahaha Beverages Co. 吉安娃哈哈饮料公司

The shares of Hangzhou Wahaha Children's Clothing Co. (杭州娃哈哈童装有限公司) founded in 2002, were initially held by Guangsheng, but were transferred out in August 2003, in an "interesting series of share transfers". It is now 65% owned by Zong, 10% by his wife, and 25% by Platinum Net Ltd.[12]
The Hangzhou Wahaha Food and Beverage Sales Co. (杭州娃哈哈食品饮料营销有限公司) "WHHFBSC", registered on 19 December 2006, is an external company allegedly now the centre of a parallel distribution network.[10] 10% of its share capital is held by Zong's wife, Shi Youzhen, and 90% by Ever Maple Trading Ltd.[10]
Zong set up non-jv owned factories, such as the Hangzhou Xiushan Shunfa Packaging Co. (杭州萧山顺发食品包装公司),[10] to manufacture or pack products identical to WHH. Danone alleges that distributors were asked to set up new bank accounts for their deposit payments in the name of WHHFBSC to sell products from these factories.[13]

These offshore companies have been reported as being subsidiaries of the Wahaha Group, and have been seized in their respective domiciles:[14]

Homepage > About SIIC > Group Profile
                            








Shanghai Industrial Co., Ltd., registered in Hong Kong in July 1981, a window company of Shanghai Municipal Government in Hong Kong, is wholly owned by State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Shanghai Municipal Government at present. In June 1993, the company was renamed Shanghai Industrial Investment (Holdings) Co., Ltd. (“SIIC”). In May 1996, Shanghai Industrial Holdings Ltd. ( 0363.HK,short for “SIHL”) affiliated to SIIC was listed in Hong Kong.
For over 30 years, SIIC has, as an overseas large-scale state-owned corporation of Shanghai Municipality and a Chinese-funded enterprise in Hong Kong, attained great achievements in attracting offshore funds and facilitating urban construction, economic development and talents cultivation for Shanghai, making significant contributions to Shanghai’s opening up, especially to the implementation of the “Go Out” strategy. By the end of 2015, SIIC owned a total of about 300 billion Hong Kong dollars in assets, and achieved an annual operating income of 152.5 billion Hong Kong dollars and a net profit of 3.22 billion Hong Kong dollars attributable to the Group in 2015. With such indexes as of total assets, operating income and net profit attributable to the parent company all ranked top among the state-owned enterprises in Shanghai, SIIC has become a comprehensive conglomerate of Shanghai with the largest scale and most powerful strength in overseas and one of Chinese enterprises with the most local representativeness in Hong Kong.
Since 2013, SIIC has, as determined upon the development strategy of integrating finance and industry, leveraged a variety of investment and financing platforms, channels and instruments with financial investment as the flagship, to discover, foster, possess, and exit industries via capital operation, and then to facilitate the development of financial investment based on the growth of the industries, thus enabling mutual promotion and collaborative development between finance and industry. Industrial layout of “1+4+X” has taken shape, namely financial investment as the leading industry, with four pillar industries of medicine, infrastructure, real estate, and consumer products as main body, to expand and enrich emerging industries X with new concepts, new mechanisms and new models，including new energy, environmental protection, and pension industry. SIIC owns five listed companies at home and abroad, including SIHL as the flagship, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd. (601607.SH/2607.HK, short for “SPG”), Shanghai Industrial Development Co., Ltd. (600748.SH, short for “SID”), Shanghai Industrial Urban Development Group Limited (0563.HK, short for “SIUD”), and SIIC Environment Holdings Ltd. (5GB.SG, listed in Singapore’s main board, short for “SIIC Environmental”), as well as over 10 direct subsidiaries, including SIIC Investment (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (short for “SIIC Investment”), SIIC Dongtan Investment & Development (Holdings) Co., Ltd. (short for “SIIC Dongtan”), Shanghai Overseas United Investment Holding Co., Ltd. (short for “Overseas United Investment”), Shanghai Investment & Asset Management Co. Ltd. (“Shanghai Asset”), Shanghai Huadong Industrial Co. Limited (short for “Huadong Industrial”), SIIC Financial Services Holdings Ltd. (short for “SIIC Financial”), Shanghai Re-Guarantee Co., Ltd. (short for “Re-Guarantee Limited”), SIIC Shanghai Venture Capital Co., Ltd. (short for “SIICVC”), and SIIC Group Finance Co., Ltd. (short for “SIIC Finance”), etc., a total of over 850 member enterprises and around 50,000 employees.
Financial Investment is the leading industry of SIIC, which has achieved a certain scale through years of development. In 2010, SIIC Investment was authorized to setup a financial vestment platform, consisting of Shanghai Industrial Investment Co., Ltd., Shanghai Overseas Company, and Hong Kong South Pacific Hotel Co. Ltd etc. In June 2014, according to the unified deployment of the municipal Party committee and the municipal government, SIIC, through marketization, invested RMB 6.1 billion to acquire six financial and real estate enterprises under Shanghai International Group based on principles of marketing. In October 2014, SIIC Finance was established with the approval of national competent administrations. The financial investment business of SIIC has obtained financial services licenses of finance company, financial leasing, mortgage, petty loan, guarantee, factoring, private placement, auctioning, bid and tender, etc., preliminarily forming a financial services industry chain of “investment-lending-guarantee-finance”.
SPH is the operating platform of SIIC’s medicine business. Early 2010, SIIC’s medicine business completed holistic listing with SPH as the only platform after being restructured. In 2011, SPH finished H-share financing in Hong Kong, raising HKD 15.49 billion and becoming the first “A+H” dual listing pharmaceutical company in mainland China. SPH is currently continuing to optimize its industrial and distribution structures and enhance its independent R&D and production capability. In November 2015, it was ranked the third among “Top 10 Enterprises in China’s Pharmaceutical Industry in 2015” and the first among “Top 100 Most Powerful Comprehensive Industrial Enterprises in China’s Chemical Pharmaceutical Industry in 2015”. It is one of the pharmaceutical companies with comprehensive advantages in terms of both pharmaceutical products and distribution market in China.
The infrastructure business of SIIC is divided into three sectors, namely toll roads, water utilities and “new frontier business”. SIIC owns the right to charge and manage Jing-Hu Expressway (Shanghai Section), Hu-Kun Expressway (Shanghai Section) and Hu-Yu Expressway (Shanghai Section), and owns 23.06% of the equity shares of Hangzhou Bay Bridge. The water utilities business includes SIIC Environmental Holdings Co., Ltd. and General Water of China Co., Ltd., with a daily water treatment capacity of more than 13 million tons (about 7 million by SIIC Environmental and over 6 million by General Water of China). The New Frontier business currently includes photovoltaic power generation and solid waste power generation, with an installed capacity of up to 510 MW in photovoltaic power generation and a daily solid waste treatment capacity of over 3200 tons; meanwhile, SIIC is actively exploring other New Frontier business areas.
The aim of SIIC for its domestic real estate business is basically to build a comprehensive regional development operator with a nation-wide presence while based in Shanghai. It is run and managed mainly by SIDC and SIUD, with a land reserve of over 16 million square meters and a floor area of over 5 million square meters under construction. The business currently owns up to 1.1 million square meters of property, and manages 18 million square meters of property. The real estate enterprises have been playing an active role in Shanghai’s efforts to reconstruct old areas and improve city functions, and in industrial chain expansions such as maker spaces, cultural estates and intelligent buildings, etc.
The consumer products business of SIIC includes Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Co., Ltd. (“Nanyang Tobacco”) with a history of more than 100 years, The Wing Fat Printing Co., Ltd. (“Wing Fat Printing”) and The Tien Chu (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. (“Tien Chu”). Nanyang Tobacco is the earliest national tobacco manufacturer in China, whose main brand is “Double Happiness”. Wing Fat Printing is one of the large-scale printing enterprises with the longest history in both Hong Kong and mainland China, with its main focus shifted in recent years onto the development of new eco-friendly packaging of consumer electronics. Tien Chu is a pioneer in China’s seasoning and chemical industries, whose main product is “Tien Chu“ Ve-tsin.
SIIC is pushing for further progress in two important projects, namely Chongming Dongtan and “Pearl of the Baltic Sea”. The goal of Chongming Dongtan Project is to build a Dongtan Ecological Demonstration Zone, with Ecological Town, Wetland Park and Greenport Agriculture as the three main areas. It has become an important part in the construction of Chongming Ecological Island. Dongtan Project is actively expanding pension industry, which will become a new growth point for SIIC in the future. The “Pearl of the Baltic Sea” Project, a large-scale residential community developed by SIIC in St Petersburg (Russia), is so far the largest non-energy investment project of China in Russia, which has been a focus of attention for top Party and government leaders ever since its commencement, and a great influence both at home and abroad.
In the future, SIIC will fully leverage the competitive role as the main market player, and further accelerate opening up and innovation oriented at marketization, specialization and globalization, leading the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises, and advancing the development of Hong Kong, Shanghai and the nation as a whole; continue to uphold the principle of “integration between finance and industry”, to expand across China and to overseas while rooted in Hong Kong and Shanghai, to realize simultaneous development of capital operation, industrial management and value management via integration between finance and industry, and inter-connection between Hong Kong and Shanghai, to optimize its “1+4+X” industrial layout to make its financial investment business flexible, its medicine business strong, its infrastructure business large, its real estate business preeminent, and its consumer products business lean, and fully implement Dongtan and Pearl projects at a steady pace, and pursue new “X” businesses, in an effort to continuously improve the market competitiveness of its main businesses, thus building SIIC into a leading industrial investment and innovative development platform with world fame in China.
