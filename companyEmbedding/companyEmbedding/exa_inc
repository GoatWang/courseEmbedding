History[edit]
Exa was founded in November, 1991.[1] Exa raised about $2.4 million in a series of venture capital investments from April 1993 though 1994 from Fidelity Ventures and individuals.[2] More funding was obtained in 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2005, including Boston Capital Ventures as an investor. In 1999, Stephen A. Remondi became chief executive.[1]
The company filed for an initial public offering in June 2012.[1]
For fiscal year 2012, Exa recorded total revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $45.9 million, $14.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively.[1] Since generating its first commercial revenue in 1994, Exa's annual revenue had increased for 18 consecutive years.[1] The company was profitable in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 after recording net losses in the three preceding fiscal years.[1] Exa's total revenues and Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2012 increased 21% and 51%, respectively, compared with fiscal year 2011.[1] Exa reported $61.4 million in total revenue for the full year fiscal 2015.[3] The company's total revenue is expected to be in the range of $64.7 million to $67.0 million for the full year fiscal 2016.[3]
The Exa corporate headquarters are located in Burlington, Massachusetts. The company also has U.S. offices in Livonia, Michigan and Brisbane, California, along with offices in Europe and Asia. Exa's European headquarters are located in Paris, France, and it also has European offices in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Exa's Asia headquarters are located in Japan, and its Asia offices are based out of China, India and South Korea. Exa employs over 260 people worldwide.

Automotive









Hitting Design Targets Up-Front 



 



Global automotive manufacturers face increasing pressure from government regulations and consumers to improve the efficiency of their products and reduce particulate and greenhouse gas emissions. This is driving the need for diesel, electric, and hybrid power trains, continuous improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, and reductions in vehicle weight. Consumers demand improved quality and durability — without any compromise to innovative and emotionally expressive designs. Manufacturers must offer a broader array of vehicles for different niche customer segments and geographies with wider ranges of operating conditions, on a faster design refresh schedule than in the past.

Visualizing and sharing this information (along with drag & lift data) across departments helps engineers to develop efficient vehicles while maintaining attractive styling.

These goals often conflict, requiring automotive manufacturers to make careful trade-offs of competing values. Thus, the automotive designer’s task is not to create the most attractive, fastest, quietest, or fuel-efficient car, but rather a car that sufficiently satisfies the design preferences, and functional and quality expectations of its target customer; offers fuel efficiency within a desired target range; and can be brought to market on time at an acceptable profit. This need to optimize the balance of industrial design, performance factors, cost, and process efficiencies is a continual challenge for the automotive industry.
The old methods of product development are no longer sufficient. Building prototypes to test performance and assess quality is not only very expensive, but the engineering team needs to understand the design trade-offs very early in the product development process — months or years before any prototype could be built. Simulation-driven design not only provides feedback earlier and in a more useful form than traditional approaches, but in many areas simulation has reached a level of accuracy and robustness that is sufficient to enable a manufacturer to rely solely on simulation results for design decisions and tooling sign-off without prototype testing.
Many of these design challenges (including aerodynamics, thermal management, noise, and cabin comfort) are heavily influenced by the complex fluid flows over and through the vehicle. Exa has the solution. Exa PowerFLOW’s unique, inherently transient Lattice Boltzmann-based physics enables it to perform simulations that accurately predict real-world transient conditions on the most complex geometry. PowerFLOW imports fully detailed vehicle geometry, and accurately and efficiently performs transient aerodynamic, aeroacoustic, and thermal management simulations. Exa’s solutions enable you to rapidly create, evaluate, and propose alternative designs that meet all the requirements. Using the PowerFLOW suite, you can evaluate product performance early in the design process — when change has the smallest impact on both the design process and engineering budget. PowerFLOW applications have been fully validated and are in deep productive use at many of the world’s premier automotive manufacturers.
APPLICATIONS OVERVIEW
Exa offers solutions for the following automotive applications:
AERODYNAMICS — Aerodynamic efficiency (drag); handling; driving dynamics; soiling and water management; and panel deformation
AEROACOUSTICS — Greenhouse wind noise, including propagation to the interior; underbody wind noise; sunroof and window buffeting; gap and seal noise; community noise; and cooling fan noise
THERMAL MANAGEMENT — Cooling airflow; thermal protection; brake cooling; electronics and battery cooling; drive cycle simulation; rise over ambient (intake port); and key-off and soak
CLIMATE CONTROL— Cabin comfort; HVAC system and fan noise; HVAC unit and distribution system performance; and defrost and demist
