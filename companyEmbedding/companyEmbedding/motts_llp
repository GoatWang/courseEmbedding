Quick Sips






QUICK EXPANSION
By 1887, Mott's was importing apples from across the Northeast, and exporting ciders, juices, vinegars and apple champagnes to the entire United States.







APPLESAUCE
In 1930, applesauce was added to the Mott's line, a step that caused exponential growth for the company.







APPLES IN A BOTTLE
In 1938, Mott's Apple Juice first appeared in grocery stores, making use of new processing techniques that allow the natural flavors of apples to be captured in a bottle.







THE FULL SPREAD
In 1967, the company produced more than 58 different products, including applesauce, prune juice, canned vegetable and seafood, and a line of low-calorie products marketed as "figure control."






History
The national debut of Mott's was a springboard for S. R., who had been manufacturing and growing apples in New York since 1842, using techniques he learned from his grandfather, Zebulon Mott. S. R. pioneered advanced pasteurization and filtration techniques at his mill in Bouckland, New York, and the popularity of his products began to grow.

After the death of one of his sons, S. R. retired from the apple business, selling the company to his remaining sons, John and Frederick, for $1. After John's death, Frederick sold the company, renamed Genesee Fruit Company, to the W.B. Duffy Cider Company for substantially more. In 1914, the two companies consolidated into the Duffy-Mott Company, Inc., a name that remained until it was shortened to simply "Mott's Inc." in 1986. Cadbury Schweppes acquired Duffy-Mott in 1982.

The Cadbury Schweppes purchase ushered in a new age of innovation for the brand, and in 1985, Mott's was the first applesauce to come in single-serve plastic cups. Six years later, Mott's introduced fruit-flavored applesauces, which would eventually grow into the Fruitsations flavor line. 

In 2001, Mott's Healthy Harvest, an unsweetened applesauce blended with other fruits, entered the market.

In April 2005, Mott's introduced Mott's Plus for Kid's Health and Mott's Plus Light. And in 2007, Mott's debuted Mott's for Tots, a great-tasting, prediluted juice drink, made of 100 percent juice and purified water. Mott's for Tots has 40 percent less sugar than regular apple juice, no artificial sweetener and 100 percent vitamin C. Mott's Plus Sauce, fortified with nutrients such as calcium, antioxidants or fiber, became widely available in 2008. In 2010, Mott's added Mott's Medleys to its portfolio. Packed with two total fruit and veggie servings magically hidden in every 8-oz. glass, Medleys is a great way for mom to ensure her kids are getting the fruits and vegetables they need.

The Mott's brand continues as part of Plano, Texas-based Dr Pepper Snapple Group, an integrated refreshment beverage business marketing more than 50 beverage brands throughout North America.

Mott's is an American company involved primarily in producing apple-based products, particularly juices and sauces. The company was founded in 1842 by Samuel R. Mott in Bouckville, New York, who made apple cider and vinegar. Mott products were exhibited at Philadelphia's Centennial Exposition in 1876 and Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. In 1900, the company merged with the W. B. Duffy Cider Company to become Duffy-Mott. In 1933, the company introduced prune juice.
Eventually, the company was acquired by American Brands (formerly American Tobacco) and became a division of that conglomerate. In 1982, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Duffy-Mott Company. In early 2006, all of Mott's beverage brands (Hawaiian Punch, IBC Root Beer, Mr and Mrs T Bloody Mary mix, Orangina, and Yoo-hoo) were folded into Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages. Mott's continues to operate as a separate unit of Dr Pepper Snapple Group (recently demerged from Cadbury Schweppes plc). In 2008, Marcia Cross was a spokeswoman of Mott's.[1]

Labor Issues[edit]
Mott’s, Williamson, New York[edit]
On May 23, 2010, 305 workers at the Mott's plant in Williamson, New York, represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union Local 220 (RWDSU), voted to strike after Mott's parent company, Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS)-- despite healthy profits, an increase in market share and stock price--proposed serious cuts to employee benefits.
The proposal from the company included a $1.50 per hour wage cut for all employees, a pension elimination for future employees and a pension freeze for current employees, a 20 percent decrease in employer contributions to the 401(k) and increased employee contributions toward health care premiums and co-pays. DPS came under criticism for proposing cuts to worker pay at a time when not only was the local economy in turmoil, but the top three executives at DPS had doubled their pay between 2007 and 2009.[3]
State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo wrote to Mott's on June 25, 2010, urging the company to return to the bargaining table and come to a "fair and equitable solution". [4]
The labor dispute has been a source of anxiety among many in the region, particularly apple growers. In a letter to Fang Li, President and CEO of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, US Senator Chuck Schumer expressed concern that "with unemployment in the Rochester area nearly 10 percent, the ongoing labor shortage is not only harming the 305 workers of the RWDSU Local 200 who work in the facility, but can harm the entire Wayne County economy due to the facility's centrality to the regional and state apple market."[3]
This sentiment was echoed by the New York Apple Association, Inc., in a statement urging Mott's to continue negotiations:

"The current impasse between the valued work force at the Williamson plant and management not only threatens the growers' and workers' future, but places more than 150 years of building brand recognition and consumer loyalty for Mott's products at risk." [5]

On Monday, September 13, 2010, the strike ended after Mott's workers voted to approve the company's most recent proposal. The new agreement included a wage freeze, but not the pay cuts the company had demanded. The contract also preserved pensions for existing workers.[6]

Mott's is an American company involved primarily in producing apple-based products, particularly juices and sauces. The company was founded in 1842 by Samuel R. Mott in Bouckville, New York, who made apple cider and vinegar. Mott products were exhibited at Philadelphia's Centennial Exposition in 1876 and Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. In 1900, the company merged with the W. B. Duffy Cider Company to become Duffy-Mott. In 1933, the company introduced prune juice.
Eventually, the company was acquired by American Brands (formerly American Tobacco) and became a division of that conglomerate. In 1982, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Duffy-Mott Company. In early 2006, all of Mott's beverage brands (Hawaiian Punch, IBC Root Beer, Mr and Mrs T Bloody Mary mix, Orangina, and Yoo-hoo) were folded into Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages. Mott's continues to operate as a separate unit of Dr Pepper Snapple Group (recently demerged from Cadbury Schweppes plc). In 2008, Marcia Cross was a spokeswoman of Mott's.[1]

Labor Issues[edit]
Mott’s, Williamson, New York[edit]
On May 23, 2010, 305 workers at the Mott's plant in Williamson, New York, represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union Local 220 (RWDSU), voted to strike after Mott's parent company, Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS)-- despite healthy profits, an increase in market share and stock price--proposed serious cuts to employee benefits.
The proposal from the company included a $1.50 per hour wage cut for all employees, a pension elimination for future employees and a pension freeze for current employees, a 20 percent decrease in employer contributions to the 401(k) and increased employee contributions toward health care premiums and co-pays. DPS came under criticism for proposing cuts to worker pay at a time when not only was the local economy in turmoil, but the top three executives at DPS had doubled their pay between 2007 and 2009.[3]
State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo wrote to Mott's on June 25, 2010, urging the company to return to the bargaining table and come to a "fair and equitable solution". [4]
The labor dispute has been a source of anxiety among many in the region, particularly apple growers. In a letter to Fang Li, President and CEO of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, US Senator Chuck Schumer expressed concern that "with unemployment in the Rochester area nearly 10 percent, the ongoing labor shortage is not only harming the 305 workers of the RWDSU Local 200 who work in the facility, but can harm the entire Wayne County economy due to the facility's centrality to the regional and state apple market."[3]
This sentiment was echoed by the New York Apple Association, Inc., in a statement urging Mott's to continue negotiations:

"The current impasse between the valued work force at the Williamson plant and management not only threatens the growers' and workers' future, but places more than 150 years of building brand recognition and consumer loyalty for Mott's products at risk." [5]

On Monday, September 13, 2010, the strike ended after Mott's workers voted to approve the company's most recent proposal. The new agreement included a wage freeze, but not the pay cuts the company had demanded. The contract also preserved pensions for existing workers.[6]
