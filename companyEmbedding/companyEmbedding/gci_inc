 Pallets & Headers  Pallets and headers are dies that are
used to form the two ends of a concrete pipe, and provides a leak proof joint on assembly. The pallet is used to form the "bell" or female end of the pipe whereas the header is used to form the
"spigot" or the male end of the pipe.
These products are critical to have a
good joint in concrete pipes or boxes. The accuracy and tolerances of these dies determine the final quality of the joint in concrete pipes/boxes.
The products are generally customized and
meet individual customer's requirements. Some of the factors that influence its design are: Process employed in manufacture - dry cast or wet cast, Type of equipment employed , type of gasket
etc.
The products are generally made from Cast
Iron, Ductile or SG iron and steel. They are then machined to dimensions and tolerances that are required to form a good seal with a gasket when the concrete pipe is assembled  Constructional Castings  In 1999, GCI acquired two acres of land
in Bonner Springs, a part on Kansas City Metro. It built over 2000 square feet of office space and over 80,000 square feet of warehouse.
Over the last decade GCI has expanded its
markets and now serves customers in over 10 states in the Midwest . Today it is considered a major player in these markets and has gained customer loyalty with its service and business
ethic.
This activity was suspended after the
construction castings division took off. However, recently after the manufacturing division was established, this activity has again gained importance. We have very good resources available at our
facility in India in terms of engineering expertise and machining facilities. We ourselves consume over 2000 metric tonnes of castings every year. Products can be sourced, machined and delivered as a
sub assembly. 
  
All products supplied by GCI will be guaranteed against all manufacturing defects. Castings from Gray cast iron, ductile (SG) iron, steel , stainless steels, Magnesium and some super alloys like
titanium can be developed by our manufacturing wing.  Industrial Castings  The castings were imported into Kansas
City and warehoused. A dedicated and professional sales team was developed to systematically service the markets.
Initially marketing and sales was
restricted to the Kansas City Metro area. A 400 square foot space was leased from a Company to store the products. In the next several years, GCI expanded its market to a six state area around Kansas
City. By 1998, GCI's product line increased from 40 to 250 products. Warehouse spaced increased from 400 to 15,000 square feet. Went from a one man operation 7 men.

GCI Pipe Products Inc. - About Us


















 


































HomeAbout UsProductsPhoto GalleryTrade ShowsContact Us







































 Welcome to GCI GROUPS  


GCI GROUP OF COMPANIES:


HISTORY:


 






1983:


 


Dec 23rd, in Richmond, Virginia decision
was made by the ‘Giri Brothers” to start a business. Mr. Kiran P. Giri, a Mechanical Engineering graduate was assigned the task.






 






1984:


 


Giri
Consultants, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Virginia. Decision was made to pursue foundry products, both raw castings and fully machined castings from India. Company executed
several contracts for products made from alloy steel, stainless steels, ductile and grey iron materials.






 






1985:


 


Company moved their operations to Kansas
City. The Company was only a marketing Company relying on producers in India to support their operations in Kansas City. This became increasingly difficult as vendors were unable to deliver quality
products on time. This began having a negative impact on the Company‘s reputation in the USA market. Company changed direction with a decision to market only products where the Company had control on
all aspects of production, quality and delivery.


 


This decision paved the way
for "Construction Castings Division" of the Company to take shape. All products used by municipalities within Kansas City Metro were identified, drawings made and
approvals obtained from the respective Cities. The Company then began marketing products to Cities and private developers of real estate. Five hundred square feet of warehouse space was leased, an
exclusive tie up with a foundry in India was made and products were imported.






 






1987:


 


The construction castings were being
marketed under the name of Giri Consultants and the product was being marketed under the trade name of“GCI”. In 1987, In an effort to bring the name of the
Company synonymous with the products sold, a Company named "GCI Castings, Inc." was incorporated in the State of Kansas. In an effort to keep the overheads low, the business was run out of the residence. There were no employees.






 






1988 - 1998:


 


Business began to gain steam and in
1988, a regular office was established and the first employee was added. In the initial years, Mr. Giri oversaw both quality of products before shipment from India and also sales. Over the next 15
years the company grew and extended markets to include a six state area around Kansas City. The warehouse operations grew from 400 to 20,000 square feet. By 1998, the Company employed 7 employees
including sales personnel, a Sales Manager, warehousing personal, administrative personnel.






 






1992:


 


GCI successfully developed the first
Pallet for a customer in Kansas. GCI made its first appearance in the Concrete Pipe industry by participating in its first trade show organized by the American Concrete Pipe Association (ACPA) in
Dallas. The show was truly a success. After the show, GCI received its first major orders for Pallets and headers from The Hawkeye Group for a project in Republic of Korea. Even though no
infrastructure or employees were in place, GCI still delivered the products to the satisfaction of the customer.






 






1993:


 


On 29th
January, GCI EXPORTS PRIVATE LIMITED was registered in State of Karnataka, India. A 300 square feet office was rented and GCI (INDIA) added its first employee. Orders
were flowing in and all jobs were outsourced including packing and shipping. The Hawkeye Group still remained the single largest customer for GCI. The Cretex Companies, one of the largest producers
of concrete pipes in the Midwest, placed their first order with GCI.






 






1994:


 


On October 24, 1994, GCI Exports
purchased a 5000 Square feet manufacturing building, purchase 2 CNC machines and started machining its components. The employee strength grew to increased from to 10. The sales of construction
castings and pallets and headers were divided. In May, GCI PIPE PRODUCTS, INC., was incorporated in the State of Kansas, USA. This Company was
responsible for all sales of Pallets and Headers.






 






1995 – 1998:


 






GCI PIPE PRODUCTS, INC:


These 3 years was a phase of rapid
growth. Inquiries from domestic Companies within USA started growing. The Hawkeye Group did not want GCI to do business in USA and threatened to stop doing business with GCI. Mr. Giri made a decision
to break away from The Hawkeye Group and create his own customer base. Almost 100% of The Cretex Companies business was given to GCI. The customer base swelled from 1 to over 30 during this
phase.










GCI CASTINGS, INC.


 


Sales of Construction Castings also
grew. The Company grew out of Kansas City Metro and began selling products in Iowa, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Kansas in the Mid West. The Company rented a 2000 square feet office
with over 5000 square feet warehouse. The pressure was on GCI to keep pace with the growth and provide the sales and support services. A Sales Manager, 2 sales persons, one warehouse manager and one
Office Administrator was appointed. Sales went up by over 100%.










GCI EXPORTS PRIVATE LIMITED


 


The increase in customer base in USA
also created a back pressure on this Company. A pattern shop was established in order to maintain delivery times. Two more CNC machines were purchased. Employee strength grew to 22. These additional
machines and employees created a space constraint. Further expansion at this location was ruled out. GCI now acquired 2-1/2 acres of industrial land in Jigani Industrial Area, in South Bangalore, and
began construction of a new facility.










 






1999:


 






GCI CASTINGS, INC.


 


A need for a permanent office cum
warehouse became critical, since the warehouse at any point of time had several hundred thousand pounds of castings in the yard. So in 1999, two acres of land was purchased in Bonner Springs, a part
of Kansas City Metro, GCI finally had a permanent home where all its Companies were able to consolidate their operations. A 2500 square feel office, with 75000 square of storage space was built. The
office houses both Companies










GCI EXPORTS PRIVATE LIMITED:


 


2-1/2 Acres of land was purchased at
Jigani Industrial Area in South Bangalore as part of an expansion program.










 






2001 – 2004:


 


January 1st, GCI EXPORTS PRIVATE LIITED moved into
their brand new facility with was built on 2-1/2 acres of land with 15000 square feet manufacturing building and a 5000 square feet office building in Jigani Industrial Estate in South Bangalore.
Another 6 CNC machines, including 2 numbers of 3 axes horizontal machining enters, were purchased to keep up with the increasing demand.






 






2004:


 


In the last phase of the backward
integration, GCI Group of Companies made the decision to start its own captive foundry. It had already bought over 4-1/2 acres of property about a block behind GCI Exports. This decision gave birth
to GCI CASTINGS (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED. The initial setup for the foundry included a batch mixer, induction melting furnace. It employed the 3 part no bake system. The
first trial production was made on 09/09/04.






 






2006:


 


GCI CASTINGS (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED


 


The foundry settled down and over come
it initial teething problems and stabilized production. The foundry was modernized by importing a complete no-bake system from IMF, Italy. It included a 10
MT/hr sand reclamation plant, a 20 MT/Hr continuous mixer, and a 2M x 2M compaction table. Furon was the choice for the binder. Production increased from 75 Mt to 159 MT. The foundry was made an
independent profit center which enabled it to develop products for other industrial users.






 






2007:


 


GCI in India started experiencing a very
high call volume with requests for information on manufacture of concrete pipes using the dry cast method. GCI began referring all such queries to machinery manufacturers overseas. The pressure on
GCI to enter the Pipe Machinery market began increasing and the requests were numerous. So in mid 2007 GCI decided to enter the Pipe Machinery Market. It went into a loosely held relationship with
Schlosser-Pfeiffer in Germany and began quoting Pipe machinery for the domestic market. The relationship with Schlosser-Pfeiffer (A division of The Hess Corporation) was based entirely on mutual
trust and respect for one another. Based on this strength, GCI participated in the first domestic trade show catering for Construction machinery called EXCON 2007, in November at Bangalore. It was
a great success as GCI was flooded with inquiries.






 






2008:


 


While USA and other western countries
entered the recessionary face, the Indian economy also started slowing down. Several potential customers made a conscious decision to defer project with a ‘wait and see’ attitude. However, in late
August, GCI/Schlosser-Pfeiffer combination received its first order for a Dry Cast Pipe Plant in India. Delivery was set for December 2008. Work started feverously and GCI had a number of hurdles to
overcome. It had to combine the dual task of learning and manufacturing at the same time. Engineers at GCI stepped up to the plate and the product was dispatched as per schedule in December 2008. GCI
also participated in a trade show in Hyderabad called 'COMEX 2008'. This was a show catering exclusively for construction machinery. GCI was awarded
the ‘BEST DISPLAY AWARD’ at the show.






 






2009:


 


Installation was completed and
on Sunday, January 18th, the first concrete pipe was made successfully. No problems were encountered and the product stripped without any problems.
GCI/Schlosser-Pfeiffer had their first satisfied customer in India. Truly a milestone for GCI.

                        Welcome to GCI, inc.
GCI Inc. (formerly Groundcover Inc.) has been in the custom home building business in Colorado since 2000.

Andy and Melanie Human started the business after moving into the area from South Africa, where Andy also built custom homes.

The company has built custom mountain homes ranging from small cabins, to large hand hewn Log Homes earning a reputation for quality, personal attention to detail and integrity.




                        CUSTOM HOME G.C.

                       We offer general contracting for your custom home and only start one home at a time to ensure total focus and commitment to the build. GCI Inc. also offers customized "Focal Point" upgrades to existing and new homes. 

                       REMODEL AND ADDITION WORK

                        We take pride in our quality and craftsmanship - flexible, adaptable, innovative, imaginative, personal and precise. We are committed to designing and installing the very best home improvements for your kitchen, bath, or addition. We give accurate estimates and detailed, complete contracts with each project. 

                        FOCAL POINT featured products: 
Wide range of beautiful garage doors, up to full custom
Distinctive kitchens, cabinets, and baths
Speciality hardwood and tile.

                        CREW AND SUB CONTRACTORS

                        GCI is very particular about who we hire as employees and sub contractors and demand high skill levels along with well developed respect for clients and their property. Sub contractors are independently selected by Andy to ensure that their skill level meets his standard of excellence. Many of these sub contractors have worked for Andy for more than ten years, and all of them have extensive experience in their field. 

                       SUPERVISION

                        Andy prides himself in the hands-on project management process for GCI.

You will find him to be very much on top of your project with numerous innovative ideas and suggestions. Almost two decades of experience in general contracting have made Andy very resourceful.



                       DESIGN

                       For over 10 years Andy designed almost every home he built. Drafting is no longer practical for Andy to do himself, but having him be part of your design phase will lead to a smoother build and more often than not, some significant savings.

    Testimonials

Custom Home Building


Estes Park, CO
    My wife and I have contracted GCI over the last decade for several medium to larger projects. The last being a total redesign of our ground level living space, new architectural design plan, master bathroom, living room, corridors, bedroom and guest areas. GCI provided the leadership and project management that proved invaluable. We would 100% recommend GCI. Thanks.

	-Rob and Amy B.
    

Ft Collins, CO
    Our family used Andy Human from Groundcover to help us plan, design and build our dream log home.

I discovered Groundcover years ago when I was looking to purchase an existing log cabin. We tried to buy one and lost out on it, but really liked it so we found out who built it and it led us to Andy.

Andy was involved with us throughout the entire process. We had no idea the challenges inherent in building on a severely-sloped, solid granite lot. We were able to design a full log home with 16-20 inch logs that was creatively built into and around the granite resulting in a unique, natural looking structure. Groundcover was our project manager, and Andy and the craftsmen he hired from a variety of disciplines produced a home that was just what we were looking for.

Looking back on it, the time from first starting site work to project completion was incredibly fast for a project of this complexity. They did not disappear after occupancy; instead they made sure everything was going OK and handled any minor issues we wanted dealt with. We would definitely use Andy again.

	-Tim Itzin and Family
