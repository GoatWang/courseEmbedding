Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. is an American soft drink company, based in Plano, Texas. Formerly called Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages, on May 5, 2008, it was spun off from Britain's Cadbury Schweppes, with trading in its shares starting on May 7, 2008. Cadbury Schweppes plc went on to become Cadbury plc on May 5, 2008.[4][5]

History[edit]
Beverage America and Select Beverages bottlers were purchased from the Carlyle Group in February 1998.[6] Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc Companies, Inc. to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion.[7] In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc.[8]
In 2006 and 2007, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, along with several other regional bottlers. This allowed DPS to bottle many of its own beverages and combat the recent decision by many Pepsi and Coke bottlers who had dropped their Dr Pepper and Snapple products to promote new product additions from Pepsi and Coke. Some of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up brands are still licensed to Pepsi, Coke and independent bottlers in various regions of the United States and Canada.
In November 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced it would take the beverages unit public. In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes demerged its beverage holdings forming the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group holds naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark and the Dallas Stars' practice facility, the Dr Pepper Star Center, both of which are located in Frisco, Texas. It also retains non-alcoholic beverage rights to each facility's concessions as a result of the deals as well as sponsorships with the NHL franchise.
In 2008, Dr Pepper Snapple Group purchased minority interest in Big Red, Inc, makers of Big Red, NuGrape, Nesbitt's and other flavored drinks.[9]
In 2014, the company announced that it accomplished its goal of reducing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in its plastic bottles. Dr Pepper Snapple lowered the amount of PET in its bottles by over 60 million pounds between 2007 and 2014.[10]
On November 22, 2016 it was announced that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group had made a cash purchase of Bai Brands for the price of $1.7 billion. It had previously purchased a minority stake in the company for $15 million in 2015.[11]

Good morning and welcome to Dr Pepper Snapple Group's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and includes a slide presentation, which can be accessed at www.drpeppersnapple.com. The call and slides will also be available for replay and download after the call has ended.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Heather Catelotti, Vice President, Investor Relations. Heather, you may begin.
Heather Catelotti - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement, and remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning our future financial and operational performance. These forward-looking statements should also be considered in connection with cautionary statements and disclaimers contained in the Safe Harbor statement in this morning's earnings press release and our SEC filings. Our actual performance could differ materially from these statements and we undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements.
During the call, we may reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that reflect the way we evaluate the business, and which we believe provide useful information for investors. Reconciliations of those non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and on the Investors page at www.DrPepperSnapple.com. This morning's prepared remarks will be made by Larry Young, President and CEO; and Marty Ellen, our CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Larry.
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Thanks, Heather, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by saying that I'm proud of our teams for delivering strong top-line results this quarter, resulting from solid execution behind our focused consumer-centric strategy. In our CSD portfolio, once again, we outperformed the category, growing both dollar and volume share in IRI-measured markets.
We're investing behind our newest brand, Bai, at greater levels than previously planned and are executing against the strategy we communicated back in April. Our results are encouraging, and I'll speak more about that in a moment.
Our allied brand strategy continues to allow us to go where the consumer is going and drive both top-line and bottom-line growth for the business, all of this while RCI continues to improve the operating platform on which we run the business.
For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 3% on just over 1.5 points of positive mix. Our CSDs grew 3% in a continued challenging environment, and our non-carb brands increased by 5% in the quarter.
Dr Pepper increased 2%, driven by: regular Dr Pepper, which grew 2% in the quarter; and Diet Dr Pepper, which grew 1%, again outperforming the diet category. 7UP grew 5%, driven by growth in both the U.S. and the Caribbean. This marks the third consecutive quarter of growth for this brand in the U.S., following our RCI Lean track last year and our new marketing campaign for this year.

Canada Dry grew 6% and Schweppes increased 4% on continued growth in the ginger ale and sparkling water categories. A&W was flat in the quarter. Peñafiel increased 8% on strong performance in both mineral water and our ades line. (4:00) Squirt grew by 7% and all other CSDs decreased 1%.
In non-carbs, Snapple bottler case sales declined by 1% in the quarter, as strong shipments for a promotional event at a large retailer are expected to sell through in the third quarter. Mott's increased 2% on growth in sauce and Clamato grew 3%. Bai increased 118%, primarily on the acquired volume outside our system, as well as on continued growth in our own DSD system, which grew by 37% in the quarter. Our expectation for the full year is still for volume growth on the brand across all systems of about 40% to 50%, as we continue to gain new distribution and availability and drive trial activity in the marketplace.
Our growth allied brands increased 45%, driven by continued strong growth across BODYARMOR, Core and FIJI, once again demonstrating the continued success and importance of this strategy. All other NCBs declined 4% in the quarter.
Our calendar for the back half of the year is packed with programs that will continue to unlock growth and leverage the power of our priority brands. Dr Pepper will be front and center again this year during the college football season. This program is right on strategy for the brand and continues to be more successful every year. And we're going to keep that momentum going and make it even bigger this year. We're bringing back our college football celebrity, Larry Culpepper, and his tailgating RV as well as executing national media across TV, digital and social and driving strong activation at retail.
We will continue to communicate our new messaging on 7UP across all platforms, highlighting the versatility of the brand. As I mentioned earlier, the performance of this brand in the U.S. has improved in recent quarters, giving us early-on confidence that we're on the right track with consumers.
And we've got some exciting news on Snapple. For the first time, we'll give consumers a new, more convenient single-serve option as we roll out our 16-ounce plastic bottle that looks and feels just like our iconic 16-ounce glass bottle, complete with a metal cap that pops.
Now, let me talk about the recent performance of Bai, the opportunities for the brand, how we're executing against our communicated strategy and driving sustainable growth for the long-term. On a year-to-date basis, retail sales of Bai are up almost 37% across IRI-measured channels, significantly outperforming both the category and its key competitors. We're seeing strong growth across multiple channels and, importantly, in the grocery and convenience channel.
ACV levels across base Bai flavors and Cocofusion's have continued to improve across all channels; however, there is still a great deal of opportunity in the convenience channel with current ACVs in the 50% range. Our current plans for the balance of the year for base and Cocofusion's in this channel should accelerate growth. We've got new authorizations to add over 7,000 new stores across several large national and regional convenience store chains, and that's just C stores. We've also got authorizations for new SKUs in large-format accounts that will go in during the fall reset timeframe and thousands of new cooler placements going in as well.
We're placing several hundred additional bidrocap displays (7:42) across large-format in the balance of the year. And also just this month, launched our second biosphere (7:49) market in Southern California. We've seen growth of about 115% over the past year in specific retail chains in the Dallas biosphere. (7:59) So we're taking those learnings and expanding this innovative execution strategy into L.A. and Orange County. And while Bubbles is also showing positive ACV gains, this brand still has tremendous distribution potential across all channels.

As we've said, we're repositioning the brand from a price point, package and shelf-set perspective, so as to capture share in sparkling water. We expect to see improved performance on Bubbles over the balance of this year and 2018.
We said in April that a critical piece of our strategy was not just about gaining new points of distribution, but also about driving trial and getting the brand into consumers' hands. Because we know that once they try it, they're likely to buy it again, as demonstrated by the brand's strong repeat purchase rate.
We're currently running trial-driving activity in the marketplace at an even greater level than we originally planned, as trial rates continue to show improvement, and we want to maximize the opportunity through summer selling season.
We will also continue to run some level of activity through the balance of the year. We're also investing heavily in marketing to drive brand awareness as well as to drive trial, spending $20 million in the second quarter, as we had planned.
We recently received our first MROI analytics for Bai and have seen strong response to our TV and social campaigns, so we will continue those through the balance of this year. We're expecting our heaviest market investment in the third quarter of this year, capitalizing on these learnings.
Bai's ready-to-drink tea is performing well in certain accounts where it has been repositioned in the tea set, gaining several share points in a short period of time. And our re-launch of antioxidant water is slated for the latter part of this year, driving some upside this year, but more so beginning in 2018. The entire organization and I could not be more excited about the future of this brand.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Marty to walk you through the financials and our guidance.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Thanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Overall, second quarter results were in line with our expectations. Our base business results overachieved and we invested more heavily in Bai. Reported net sales grew 6% on strong volume growth of 4%.
Reported segment operating profit declined 1% in the quarter, primarily on heavy marketing investments behind Bai and higher marketing spend for our other priority brands. Marketing spend on Bai was $20 million, and we also increased marketing by $16 million on our other priority brands. Core operating income and core EPS were both flat in the quarter.
Now, let me walk you through the details. Reported net sales increased 6% in the quarter, including the Bai acquisition, which accounted for just over 1 percentage point of our net sales growth. Total Bai sales, including our DSD distribution, accounted for just over 2 percentage points of our net sales growth. And now, Bai represents about 4.5% of our total company revenues. This represents a meaningful and important positive shift in our portfolio.
Organic net sales grew, as organic volumes were up over 3%. Product mix contributed just over 1.5 percentage points of growth. Net sales growth was partially offset by the loss of our remaining distribution of Rockstar in the quarter.
Reported gross margins decreased 50 basis points from 60.5% last year to 60% this year. The unfavorable impact of unrealized mark-to-market commodity changes decreased gross margins by 120 basis points. Excluding this, core gross margins increased by 70 basis points. The added margin from now owning the Bai brand increased gross margins by 125 basis points, while higher commodity costs and increases in certain manufacturing costs reduced gross margin by 40 basis points each.
Further improving gross margins in the quarter were continued productivity benefits, including those from RCI and lower discounts. These positive factors were partially offset by negative effects of foreign currency and unfavorable mix, mostly from continued allied brand growth. For the quarter, SG&A increased $93 million. The acquisition of Bai added $40 million, including $20 million in marketing and $1 million of transaction expenses.

SG&A also increased due to an unfavorable $18 million comparison of unrealized commodity mark-to-market activity and further increased on a $16 million increase in planned marketing behind our other priority brands. The remainder of the SG&A increase was mostly due to certain operating expenses and additional planned investment behind our DSD front-line workforce. Depreciation and amortization increased $1 million in the quarter.
Other income increased $1 million, which includes a $4 million gain from the termination of our distribution of Rockstar. Reported income from operations declined by $39 million in the quarter; however, $37 million of this decline was due to an unfavorable comparison of unrealized mark-to-market activity. The impact of the Bai acquisition, including $3 million of acquisition and transaction expenses, contributed $10 million of this decline.
Below the operating line, net interest expense increased $11 million, mostly due to the higher debt balances associated with the Bai acquisition. We recognized a $49 million loss in the quarter on the early extinguishment of debt. Other income declined by $20 million, as last year included a $21 million gain on the settlement of a multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability. Our reported effective tax rate was 33.2% compared to 35.3% in the prior-year period. This quarter's tax rate included a $6 million favorable tax planning benefit.
Moving on to cash flow, cash from operating activities was $410 million, down $18 million compared to last year, primarily driven by timing of payables. Capital spending was $41 million compared to $68 million last year. Total distributions to our shareholders were $381 million, with $204 million in dividends paid and $177 million in shares repurchased.
Before I move on to guidance, I'd like to give a quick update on RCI. We've shared in the past about how we utilize the tools of Lean not only to drive productivity across the business, but also to help drive top-line growth, whether it be closing voids across several of our priority brands, improving display execution or, as Larry just mentioned, the impressive improvement we've seen in our U.S. 7UP business over the past couple of quarters.
Our 2017 Lean tracks are well underway, and I'll mention just a couple of wins that further demonstrate the application of Lean process improvements to drive sales.
As a result of our DSD display execution track, our Texoma region reached their highest display ACV in five years, representing a 61% improvement over the prior year by implementing single point selling training and developing account manager standard work.
And a Northern California region of a large retailer achieved a 50% display rate improvement across our Warehouse Direct business. There's a tremendous amount of RCI activity that happens across the business on a daily basis, so much so that we're going to increase our investment in RCI by actively seeking additional RCI resources to add to our strong bench of highly-trained Lean and Six Sigma professionals. I'm proud of where we're at as a company only six years into our endless RCI journey.
Now, moving to 2017 guidance, we're now expecting net sales growth of about 4.5%, as the recent weakening of the dollar is causing foreign currency translation to no longer have a material impact on net sales. We continue to expect that about 2% of this net sales will come from our acquisition of Bai. Organic volume growth is still expected to be over 1%. And the acquisition of Bai is still expected to contribute just under 1% of our total company volume growth.
There is just over 1.5% price/mix embedded within our growth and about 50 basis points of this price/mix is the impact of our beginning of the year concentrate price increase. Our expected revenue growth also reflects the recent loss of our distribution of the Rockstar brand on the West Coast.

Moving on to cost of goods, given our hedged positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions, we continue to expect packaging and ingredients, excluding the acquired Bai business, to be inflationary by about 50 basis points on a constant volume mix basis.
For your modeling purposes, remember that growth of our non-carb portfolio, including our allied brands, will increase the dollar value of cost of goods and also remember that cost of goods sold is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction.
Collectively, all the factors I mentioned above, coupled with the added gross margin we realize now being the brand owner of Bai, are expected to result in a full year gross margin increase of about 50 basis points.
Moving to SG&A, excluding our acquisition of Bai, we're still expecting an increase of approximately $30 million, collectively, in general cost increases and expense associated with investments made in our DSD front-line workforce.
We also continue to expect an increase of approximately $10 million to $15 million in health and welfare and risk insurance expenses. RCI productivity benefits will help offset a portion of these increases. We expect marketing investment, excluding Bai, to be about 7.5% of net sales, in line with historical trends.
Now, moving below segment operating profit, our net interest expense is still expected to include an incremental $15 million (19:35) associated with the debt to acquire Bai. In other income, we will be lapping a $5 million favorable non-cash gain on our acquisition of our Aguafiel joint venture in Mexico in the third quarter of last year.
Other income for this year includes the $28 million gain on our equity in Bai that was recorded in the first quarter and the $4 million gain on the termination of the Rockstar agreement that was recorded this quarter.
Our full-year core tax rate is still expected to be approximately 34%. We continue to expect strong free cash flow in 2017, with stock repurchases of approximately $450 million to $500 million, subject to market conditions. We also continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 3% of net sales. We continue to expect foreign currency to negatively impact our income from operations in 2017.
The combined effect of both foreign currency translation and transaction is now expected to reduce core EPS by approximately $0.04 for the year, primarily driven by our assumption on the Mexican peso, which we have forecasted at 19 to the dollar for the balance of the year. The impact of Bai on consolidated core EPS is now expected to be $0.07 dilutive, as we have further increased trial-driving activity in the marketplace. Taking all of the above into account, we are still expecting core EPS in the $4.56 to $4.66 range.
Now, let me provide some commentary to help you with your modeling for the third quarter, as certain year-over-year expense increases and lapping the gain I just mentioned should be considered. First, with respect to the acquired Bai business, the brand is still expected to ramp up over the balance of the year. And, importantly, we are expecting our heaviest level of marketing investment behind the brand in the third quarter. As a reminder, we spent $20 million in marketing this quarter. And second, we expect about $5 million of the health and welfare and risk insurance increase to occur in the third quarter.
With that said, let me turn the call back over to Larry.
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Thanks, Marty. Before we open the lines for questions, let me leave you with a few brief thoughts. We're focused on driving growth through our priority brand strategy and our business is strong. We're executing against our communicated strategy for Bai, gaining new points of distribution on availability, driving trial and investing significantly behind the brand to drive awareness. Our early results are encouraging, and we are excited about the future of this brand.

Our allied brand strategy is working and continues to drive meaningful growth for the company. RCI continues to drive both top-line growth and productivity across the business. And, most importantly, we remain committed to returning excess free cash to our shareholders over time.

Your first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC
Hi. Good morning.
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Morning, Vivien.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Good morning.
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC
So my one question has to do with Bai, please. You've clearly made a lot of headway in terms of locking in new distribution from a retail perspective. So can you just remind us, for the 40% to 50% growth outlook, how is kind of the underlying growth evolved in terms of the mix of velocity versus distribution gains? Thank you.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Vivien, it's Marty. So it's a combination of the two. I know we shared on the slide this morning where we are in terms of ACV and also where velocities have improved too through the year. So really, we're counting on both. The velocities is really, of course, a hugely encouraging number, because that will entitle us to more space over time and, of course, that is a huge factor.
The other consideration for the brand balance of year is both the improvement emphasis on Bubbles, which we're really just getting started because we repositioned it, and then some of the other innovation, both water and tea. And we'll get some of that in the back half and depending upon retailer calendars, some of that may push to 2018, but we've considered all that in our guidance.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.
Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Oh, good morning, gentlemen. Lot of discussion about Bai, of course, but I wonder if we could take a broader view, either a total carbonated view or a total portfolio view. And what I'm getting at is it seems like you guys are bobbing-and-weaving better than some of your competition, as Walmart price promotes and Amazon does what they're doing. And so I'm not asking for a retailer-specific set of trends, but can you give us a sense, again, whether it's for the total CSDs or for the total portfolio, how your channel performance is laying out for your portfolio, what the comparative strength is from channel-to-channel?
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Yeah, Mark, I think the biggest thing is as you keep looking at how we go to market with our consumer-centric strategy, I mean, our customers really like the data that we bring in, where we have the brands at the right place, the right price points, the right occasions. So it's working very well for us across all of our channels. And the teams go in. Our sales stories are all in – it's fact-based. It's all data. It's points they want to see that help them drive more people through their store.
So it goes across all of our LRB's. I mean, we've got the priority brands. We go in. That's the main thing we sell, priority brands and Bai. Bai is a priority brand now. And our results are showing that it works.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Mark, let me add something because I'll probably head-off another question from somebody else. It goes to execution. And we don't underestimate execution. And any of you that have been around us and talked about RCI, quality and delivery from the customer's perspective comes before productivity. We invested in our workforce. This industry has forever had too much turnover and too many open positions. And it leads to poor service. Every order in this company gets filled complete and on time. Shelves get merchandised properly, so there are no out of stocks. Not that there aren't any, but we measure this stuff. We go after this stuff. And this quarter was as much about investing in marketing and our brands as investing in the people that are out there executing. And while I can't point to it, we would hope, and expect and believe that some of that effort and work is resulting in our top-line performance.

Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
That's great. And if I could follow up on that topic, when you look at the absolute growth of, say, C stores versus say, club stores or large format, can you just give us some sense of the complexion of growth, what's performing best, what's slower?
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Yes, I think as you look at it, as far as growth, Mark, you said not mention any account specific, but Walmart's doing very well, run well with Walmart. Convenience is always a strong, strong focus of ours. We continue to go after the convenience channel aggressively. We noticed it was a little lighter in the second quarter, the entire channel, but we still did well there. So, I think that's kind of where we're driving most of it.
Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Fair enough, great. Thank you, gentlemen.

Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse.
Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Good morning, Larry and Marty.
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Good morning.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Morning.
Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah, I just want to have, I mean, if you can add some color to all the niche marketing initiatives you are doing on Bai in term of driving the trial and also I mean moving bottles into a different place in the store? So that's one.
And two, if you don't mind, in term of numbers, you said you would spend about $100 million this year in additional marketing, $20 million on core, $80 million on Bai. Right now, you've spent $16 million on core, $20 million on Bai additional. So are you still planning to maintain $80 million for Bai for the balance of the year or rebalance between core and Bai or just spend less?
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Laurent, it's Marty. Let me take the marketing question here. So, probably a little less on marketing but more in trade and that should be somewhat expected if you think about what we're trying to do short-term to drive trial. If you've been in your large format stores, you've probably seen the three for $5 promotion. If you've been in your C stores, you've probably see two for $4 or price point thereabout, which is what we decided, as Larry said, to just go after and particularly take advantage of the summer and spend our money, mostly our money, right, to do that so we could do it quickly and get the results we've gotten.
So it partly makes sense, too, to spend a little more and get the trial going, particularly as we continue to build it through ACV, because we want to have really strong ACV numbers as we do more national whole marketing.
On the marketing side, as Larry said, we've got our first set of learnings from the analytics that we do to understand return and contributions from marketing. Larry touched on a few things that we're going to emphasize. Their heavy media calendar is picking back up, as I said, so more than a $20 million number in the third quarter, as I said.
So we think right now, we have a really good balance of both what we're doing in marketing and the vehicles that we're spending that money on in terms of effectiveness and then spending the trade dollars, which, of course, the trade dollars come out of net sales. That's the way they're treated on our books, okay? So that puts a little pressure on that, but that's just trial-driving activity. That'll go away at some point here. We do have activity through the balance of the year and then we'll hope you'll see the brand at some different everyday price point.
Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thank you. And in term of marketing spend, I mean, you said you would spend more in Q3. Should we think about kind of a 70/30 (31:05) between Q3 and Q4?

Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
The way I would think about modeling us is take my comments. You're going to have to think about that full-year number from Bai, third quarter being more than $20 million and I said, for the company without Bai, I said we should average something around 7.5% (31:24), consistent with historical trends.
Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Okay. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore.
Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI
Great. Thank you very much. Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the allied brand pipeline, I think a year or so ago, you mentioned that you were doing a couple of trials of potential new allied brands, and I don't think we ever heard about that. So I'd love to get your thoughts on that.
And then second, what you're seeing in terms of the Hispanic consumer, and there are some reports – Target talked about some weakness in that demographic and wondered if you were seeing that also. Thank you.
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Yes, yes. I'll start off with the Hispanic. With our brands, that are so strong with the Hispanic community, you saw the growth we had in Peñafiel, the growth we had in Clamato, our flavored CSDs are all growing. So I think we're still doing very well there with the consumer there. The first part of the question?
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
I'll take it. Allied brand pipeline, so there's a lot happening there. We've probably, Robert, looked at, I don't know, listed 15, maybe 20 opportunities in all sorts of – some of the spaces, a lot happening in the ready-to-drink coffee space. We're there with High Brew. There are a lot of things happening. A lot of sub-categories or sub-segments within these larger segments are emerging on the basis of organic or natural. So you'll see. There's an interesting view of maybe around the energy category, in organic energy products or natural energy products.
And so the question continues to be picking the right horses for us to ride. And as I've told many of you before, it's about making sure that our checklist gets fulfilled in terms of: the management; the strategy; we're aligned on the opportunity because we're not going to own these companies, and we're not going to be able to control a lot of decisions; their access to capital, so we don't have to fund them, so that they can have the resources to act as the brand owner, which has a lot to do with not just in product, but selling and marketing.
And we continue to look at them. We believe we continue to have capacity through our system to handle them, so we're not constrained on our side. But if we're going to put the effort in, we have to pick something that we think is going to work and work over the long-term. Some products come and go, and we just can't waste our time with those.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, good morning.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on the non-marketing expense increase in the quarter. Perhaps you could walk us through how much of that was one-time in nature versus how much of it is trending upwards and expected to continue. And then finally, what, if anything, are you guys doing to bring those expenses back down?
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Okay, Bonnie. I think I can do this simply for you. If you look at you're A schedules and core SG&A, you'll see in the quarter it's up $74 million. The breakdown is really three numbers. We said $40 million we brought over from Bai. That didn't exist last year, so that's the SG&A, which includes their $20 million of marketing, that's $40 million. $16 million, I said, is our increase in marketing. And most of the balance, three-quarters of the balance, is increased investment in labor and our front-line workforce.

Other than that, there's a few million dollars left over, which is, I believe, less than a 1% increase. So actually, we're pretty happy with our SG&A performance. So you just have to consider those pieces. We're really not comparable year-over-year because we acquired Bai. That's the biggest piece, and then of course, our increase in marketing.
The front-line labor investment, we actually started making last year in the second half. So a lot of the increase in that should go away back half of the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.
Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Hey, good morning. So, just back to Bai, the results look good, but obviously there were a number of questions raised last quarter, and you're pushing through a lot of change. And the departure intra-quarter of Ben Weiss seemed a bit of a surprise, at least from the outside. So, can you just talk about how you're managing that transition to maintain momentum?
I know you put Lain Hancock in charge. And I think Lain's great. So, Lain, if you're listening, congrats. But I think Lain has spent most of his time in HR and supply chain roles. And this seems a very different assignment. So, maybe just some sort of your perspective there because it's been a question that I've received a couple times since the announcement. Thanks.
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
You're correct. It is a very different assignment, but that's how we create general managers that can run every bit of the business. And we spend a lot of time here on how we develop leaders for the future and we put them in a lot of different roles. And so I think I can tell you he's doing a great job. But I think the people there will tell you that he's doing a great job.
We've still got Ken and most of the team there in place. The momentum is just continuing to build. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we couldn't be more excited about what we're seeing for the future.
Ben was a wonderful entrepreneur who created a tremendous brand. And I think we all knew it would be tough for him being in a public company. I mean, we've all seen it in the past. So we thank him for his contributions and we're just thrilled to death with the way the team is under Lain and Ken.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So, Marty, I guess I wanted to just clarify the full-year guidance. I think a few items have kind of changed. You've got more favorable FX versus prior guidance. You've got a little bit more dilution on Bai. You've got higher sales growth forecast now. It kind of seems like your guidance, if I kind of take all the puts and takes, could actually be a $0.05 or $0.10 higher than prior guidance. So I'm just wondering if I'm missing anything in terms of some of adverse headwinds that you didn't specifically call out that's either the same or gotten worse versus prior guidance.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Well, I think, Judy, you have it right. We're spending a little more on Bai, as we discussed a minute ago, some lifts to improvement, lower effective FX. We're mid-way through the year. The guidance range is a $0.10 range and at this point, we didn't see any need to want to change our expectation. We'll see where we're at next quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO.
Drew N. Levine - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi, there, this is Drew Levine on for Amit. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to touch on the Latin America segment, certainly a better margin performance than we were expecting and also some strong sales performance. So just wondering if you could comment on what's driving that, and which countries specifically you're seeing some strength in. Thanks.

Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
LAB, for us, is predominantly Mexico. And as we said in our prepared remarks, Peñafiel at just up 8%, that is their lead brand. We look at that business down there, we look at the market down there, and, quite frankly, our team down there just continues to do two things really well, innovate and execute. And it's just that simple. They continue to outperform. And Peñafiel this quarter, as I said, up 8%. And they've done some flavor innovation. They've introduced a coconut flavor that I think has now become if not three, number four, Peñafiel flavor. And the consumer environment may have gotten a little better down there, but our growth, our performance, is clearly market share gaining in Mexico.
And I wish I could point to something specific or some something we discovered, some secret recipe. Well, if I did, I probably wouldn't tell you, but it's not. They are just doing the basics of the business every single day better than they did it the day before it. And we'd be remiss if we didn't congratulate our team at this point for their performance.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. So two questions on Bai, one is just back to the level of reinvestment, want to get a sense of how you're actually thinking about the ROI on it. Clearly, you're spending more on it than I think you probably had anticipated when you're modeling the acquisition. Dilution, it's gone to $0.07 from $0.02. How do you think about the ROI? I know it's a very short timeframe. You're saying, look, the velocity is good, etcetera. But on an ongoing basis, what do you think the level of spend should be and how do you measure it?
And then the second question I had on Bai was really when you first took it on, you were very, very adamant about it's going to be run separately. It's going to keep its entrepreneurial flavor, et cetera, et cetera. And clearly, that was to, I think, mitigate the problems you did see with Ben being in a public company, you said yourself. And, of course, he leaves as a wealthy man from this entrepreneurial venture. But how does that, I guess, change of plan or messiness, for lack of a better word, impact, do you think, your attractiveness to other potential entrepreneurs to join DPS, as the nicer, better to work with company, right? Has that halo disappeared a little bit, so ROI and then just the attractiveness going forward, given some of the changes? Thanks.
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Yeah, I'll let Marty handle the ROI. But as far as Bai, in the beginning, we said Bai would be Bai. And it is. It's being run separately. When you're publicly traded, there are certain things that have to be in place. And so we've got those in place. We're still running out of Trenton, New Jersey. We'll continue to do that. They know now that they can come to us whenever they need things, different resources. And I've got a tremendous relationship with a bunch of these entrepreneurs that love us to death.
But they also know that whenever it comes into something like if it doesn't work, because a lot of our entrepreneurs have already done it once before, with Fuze and with vitaminwater and different ones.
So it's just a learning curve, but they also know that the relationship with us is that we've got this tremendous distribution arm, that we can go out there and get them in places where they can't go anywhere else and have that kind of coverage. So it works both ways. It's a partnership. It's a team effort. And we're not looking at any others we're picking up right now, but we never quit looking. So I think we got good relationships with all of them.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.

Ali, your question on ROI is actually a very good one because Bai is a different brand than actually all of our other brands. Normally, when we would plan trade, and I'm going to address this from a trade ROI perspective as opposed to a marketing ROI perspective. When we normally think about planning trade with more mature brand, we're connecting the dots between an investment, our elasticity models, in terms of the lift from, say, a price reduction, and connecting the dots to the extent that we have to do some of that either to get the lift to create the velocity if needed for the retailer. But, in essence, it's a simple price sort of volume trade-off that's been modeled, we think, quite sophisticatedly.
Now, in the case of Bai, remember, of course, we expect lift from trade and promo pricing, but the real return needs to come from improvement in trial, which will also show up as improvement in household penetration. We know where the household penetration is. We would go to raise the household penetration. We've probably seen a couple points of improvement so far in trial as measured, but we can't get this data real-time. We need to use our services to go out and survey the consumers, do their panel work and come back to us with the data, which may or may not be available to all of you, I'm not sure.
So, but ultimately, that's what we're going to be looking for here very soon. And that will be our ultimate measure of success in driving trial, as opposed to the way we look at trade on our traditional brands.

Peter K. Grom - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you and good morning.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Morning.

I just wanted to ask a quick question on Snapple. You mentioned in the press release that strong shipments from a promotional event are expected to sell through in the third quarter. So one, have you already started to see this sell-through occur? And I just want to get your thoughts on how we should think about the growth for the brand in the back half of the year. Thanks.
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Yes, we're already seeing the results for July (45:27) and so we're pleased with it. There's still a lot more to go. I think we've got our plans with the plastic bottle. We've got a lot of different things out there that we're going to be using with Snapple. The juice side of our Snapple's still doing very well. Juice continues to grow. So as we get going into the selling season for resets, I mean, we're going in with a very strong tea strategy with Snapples, our flavored teas, our straight-up teas and our Bai Superteas. So, I think the trade's really embracing seeing that we can come in and cover all angles of the tea category.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Good morning.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.
The revenue this quarter, I mean, was incredibly strong, and, remarkably, we haven't talked about that yet. So I think on 7UP, we're all well aware of the more specific actions you've taken in the last couple of months, the renewed advertising, repositioning and so on. But anything else that you think you'd want to call out where something has changed, where you've done something a bit differently that's really kind of kicked in?
And then, as we look at the back half of the year, I know you have a legacy of being conservative, but it feels like the net sales change was more about FX than about the better than expected organic this quarter. So is there anything we should keep in mind sequencing-wise, any kind of timing shift in the second half that hasn't been mentioned yet? Thank you.

Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Lauren, it's Marty I'll take it and Larry can add, if he so chooses. There's a lot of things. We'd like to think that all the effort and money we put into developing our strategy a couple years ago, really going deep with the consumer and using that data to align our marketing campaign, 7UP being a great example, the focus that came from that by us making choices, choices about what brands to focus on as priority and what brands not to and where to direct our resources. And then, we overlay execution and our focus on execution, our focus on the customer, our portfolio. We like our portfolio. We've always said we think we have an advantaged portfolio and particularly in CSDs.
Larry talked about the opportunity we see in tea. And let's not leave out water when you look across our allied brands in Bai and what we've got happening there and the selling stories we're going to have from retailers there.
So we put all that together and say, yeah, I said we overachieved. We did not predict that level of top-line. But we're really satisfied and encouraged and we think that it's a collection of those activities. There is business to be had. There is share to be gained. In CSDs, I don't know if it's a zero sum game or not, but that doesn't mean we can't gain share and work hard at it. And we're going to continue to do that.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Morning, Kevin.
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Morning.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC
Two questions, I'll ask them both concurrently. So the first one, just to sort of clean up the Bai question, Marty. So is it too early to say that the cost of growth will be higher for that brand? This was sort of asked earlier, but so is the nickel more dilutive but the growth outlook doesn't change, maybe there was some conservatism in that, maybe not?
But how should we think about that dynamic, where it's more dilutive, you're spending more behind it, but seemingly the growth outlook hasn't changed? But maybe that's not the case. Maybe the expectation is this is long-term brand-building and as you guys are thinking about it, this is more of a 2018 acceleration than 2017. So just to sort of tie the loop on that and some quantification would be great.
And then, Marty, you just touched on CSDs, so you've done really nicely from a share perspective, as has Coke. And Pepsi continues to donate share. What are you seeing differently from them? I'm not sure how much you want to comment on your competition. I sort of understand that. Are you seeing anything differently from an execution perspective? Are you seeing a share of voice move down? And they've started talk a little bit more about spending behind North America Beverages. So if that's the case and indeed that does play out, do you have enough cushion in your guidance here to match from a spending perspective? Thank you for both of those.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
All right, Kevin, appreciate your question. Let me talk about Bai. Bai, in terms of donating share, last time I looked, nobody's a charity. Nobody's donating anything. We all go out every day and we work hard. And they work hard, too.
Look, Bai investment, it's a great question. So the cost of growth, end of the year, we talked about upwards of $80 million in marketing, traditional sort of pull marketing. And we've come down a little bit and replaced some of that with trade to drive short-term trial activity.
Clearly, from a marketing point of view, the marketing for that brand, probably for a while, will stay elevated. It's a relative question, relative to what? Well, relative to 7.5% of sales of cores because our brands are mature. Our brands have high household penetration. They have enormous brand awareness and brand equity. We would nowhere need to do the same tactics, of course, on our mature brands that we would on an evolving and more nascent brand.

And we're not going to let this opportunity get away from us. We are not going to be short-sighted here. We have an opportunity to do something. We haven't had the opportunity to do it before. This brand has lots of opportunity. And we're going to go after it, but we're going to go after it with discipline. We're going to put money into what our data says works and pull money away from things that don't work.
I'm not here saying, therefore, that we're going to open up the spigots and spend all sorts of money into 2018, but clearly at some level much higher than historically you would find us doing. The trade, which is not insignificant this year, that's short-term. That's going to drive trial. We'll get a lot of information from that. You will see the brand move back to some higher everyday price points. So therefore, we won't be funding that margin to the retailer any more.
And then the innovation and I think we're just getting started. I know we probably communicated earlier in the year that some of that would hit later this year. And we have gone back and worked on Bubbles. Larry touched on both the tea and the water probably really'd be more 2018 growth platforms than 2017.
We're really excited about the opportunity to present our portfolio to retailers, who are clearly looking to find more margin. And we've got higher price point value-added brands for them that we think are going to create a really compelling story. So near-term, Bai, yeah, the cost of growth may come somewhat higher, but, again, of course, we'd expect that.
Did we model it all initially? No. But we've had a lot of good learnings. And I don't think the amounts we're going to spend are going to be that material, more so than we thought either. I lost the CSD question somewhere.
Larry D. Young - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Well, with CSD, what we're seeing out there, I think Marty touched on our competitors are very, very competitive. They run a great operation. I think we're very fortunate that we've got some of the right brands, some of the flavors that the consumer's looking for. We mentioned that we invest in our brands. We invest in our people. And that's what's delivering our results.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I just had one related to Bai manufacturing. Marty, I think my understanding is that most of Bai is still co-packed or produced by a third party. So, I guess, if you can clarify if that's true? And if so, over time, is there an opportunity to capture more of the profits of the manufacturing profit by bringing more of that production in-house over time?
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
The answer, Bryan, is yes, it is co-packed. Yes, there's an opportunity. We do have a contractual relationship with a co-packer, whom we're working with very closely. That contract will have upwards of five years to go. There are opportunities not just to bring the production in-house, but also the logistics of moving production to other places geographically.
All the Bai product now really gets shipped from the East Coast. So just simple supply chain and logistics would say over time, we need to change the geographic footprint of the Bai supply chain. And we will be doing that. There will be profit upside, not actually insignificant.
Operator
Your final question this morning comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Good morning, everyone. Look, I have two questions. So first, thinking about your capacity to do further deals in terms of the allied brands and it seems to me that if any of the three allied brands came up for sale in the near term, based on my estimates of valuation, you will not be able to bid, given what your balance sheet is, if you could comment on that.

And the second one would be, going back to Bai, maybe it's a Marketing 101 question, but it seems to me like you're stretching the brand too much and that the core business could suffer as a result, so thinking of ways to turn (55:47) tea into water, into sparkling water. I can't imagine how Vita Coco or like Gold Peak or brands of that nature would be extendable as much, so if you can explain why Bai is extendable compared to other brands? Thanks.
Martin M. Ellen - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Okay, I'll take a stab at both of those. So Bai, the extendability of Bai, I think, as we look at the brand halo from consumers, it sort of positions it not so much as just an enhanced water, but as this clean-label, better-for-you, pure beverage. So we've done some research on this. It's got to be done in a certain way, though. If your question really goes to, for example, the reason you're seeing maybe tea not as penetrated as maybe we would have thought six months ago, it's because we want to make sure that if it's in the tea set, all of the things we're doing to increase brand awareness and equity through marketing will allow the brand to stand on its own there.
As opposed to the tea, for example, being simply viewed by the consumer as a flavor extension of the enhanced water, because the consumer data would say that the demand space and the needs being satisfied in the enhanced water category, if you will, are going to be different, both in tea and within plain tea and flavored tea, there are even differences there. So there is sort of a method to our approach to this to make sure that the strength of the base and the strength of the marketing around the base can be haloed.
Look, with respect to our capacity to make acquisitions and what may or may not happen to these other allied brands, we've said this, and I'll say it again. There's risk in our strategy of opening up our distribution to go where the consumer is going quickly because we don't ultimately control what happens with these brands and who may own these brands. We have, under the right circumstances, we would look to possibly acquire something, but that's not our strategy. We're prepared. Look, we're prepared to, if necessary, we may have to give one or more of these up over time.
The pipeline is full. You just go to any beverage industry tradeshow and you will see football field rooms full of innovative ideas and people looking for distribution. We can't predict what the future would hold. It is a risk. And, no, we would not step up and acquire all these brands. I can probably say that with certainty.

Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. is an American soft drink company, based in Plano, Texas. Formerly called Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages, on May 5, 2008, it was spun off from Britain's Cadbury Schweppes, with trading in its shares starting on May 7, 2008. Cadbury Schweppes plc went on to become Cadbury plc on May 5, 2008.[4][5]

History[edit]
Beverage America and Select Beverages bottlers were purchased from the Carlyle Group in February 1998.[6] Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc Companies, Inc. to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion.[7] In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc.[8]
In 2006 and 2007, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, along with several other regional bottlers. This allowed DPS to bottle many of its own beverages and combat the recent decision by many Pepsi and Coke bottlers who had dropped their Dr Pepper and Snapple products to promote new product additions from Pepsi and Coke. Some of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up brands are still licensed to Pepsi, Coke and independent bottlers in various regions of the United States and Canada.
In November 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced it would take the beverages unit public. In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes demerged its beverage holdings forming the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group holds naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark and the Dallas Stars' practice facility, the Dr Pepper Star Center, both of which are located in Frisco, Texas. It also retains non-alcoholic beverage rights to each facility's concessions as a result of the deals as well as sponsorships with the NHL franchise.
In 2008, Dr Pepper Snapple Group purchased minority interest in Big Red, Inc, makers of Big Red, NuGrape, Nesbitt's and other flavored drinks.[9]
In 2014, the company announced that it accomplished its goal of reducing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in its plastic bottles. Dr Pepper Snapple lowered the amount of PET in its bottles by over 60 million pounds between 2007 and 2014.[10]
On November 22, 2016 it was announced that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group had made a cash purchase of Bai Brands for the price of $1.7 billion. It had previously purchased a minority stake in the company for $15 million in 2015.[11]

Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. is an American soft drink company, based in Plano, Texas. Formerly called Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages, on May 5, 2008, it was spun off from Britain's Cadbury Schweppes, with trading in its shares starting on May 7, 2008. Cadbury Schweppes plc went on to become Cadbury plc on May 5, 2008.[4][5]

History[edit]
Beverage America and Select Beverages bottlers were purchased from the Carlyle Group in February 1998.[6] Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc Companies, Inc. to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion.[7] In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc.[8]
In 2006 and 2007, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, along with several other regional bottlers. This allowed DPS to bottle many of its own beverages and combat the recent decision by many Pepsi and Coke bottlers who had dropped their Dr Pepper and Snapple products to promote new product additions from Pepsi and Coke. Some of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up brands are still licensed to Pepsi, Coke and independent bottlers in various regions of the United States and Canada.
In November 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced it would take the beverages unit public. In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes demerged its beverage holdings forming the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group holds naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark and the Dallas Stars' practice facility, the Dr Pepper Star Center, both of which are located in Frisco, Texas. It also retains non-alcoholic beverage rights to each facility's concessions as a result of the deals as well as sponsorships with the NHL franchise.
In 2008, Dr Pepper Snapple Group purchased minority interest in Big Red, Inc, makers of Big Red, NuGrape, Nesbitt's and other flavored drinks.[9]
In 2014, the company announced that it accomplished its goal of reducing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in its plastic bottles. Dr Pepper Snapple lowered the amount of PET in its bottles by over 60 million pounds between 2007 and 2014.[10]
On November 22, 2016 it was announced that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group had made a cash purchase of Bai Brands for the price of $1.7 billion. It had previously purchased a minority stake in the company for $15 million in 2015.[11]

                            Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc                        

Dr Pepper Snapple group, Inc. is a major integrated brand owner, bottler, and distributer of nonalcoholic beverages in the United States. In 2007 they had net sales of $5.748 billion, 21 manufacturing facilities and approximately 200 distribution centers in the United States. They are the number one Company in carbonated soft drink products in the United States. Their business strategy is to invest most heavily in their key brands to drive profitable and sustainable growth by strengthening consumer awareness, developing innovative products, and brand extensions to take advantage of evolving consumer trends, improving distribution and increasing promotional effectiveness. Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. also wants to focus on driving growth in their business with emerging categories, through brand extensions, new product launches, and selective acquisitions of brands and distribution rights. The company has a future goal of significantly increasing the number of branded coolers and other cold drink equipment over the next few years, which is expected to provide an attractive return on investment. The company also intends to leverage its integrated business model to reduce costs by strategically creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage and to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of large retail customers by coordinating sales, service, distribution, promotions, and product launches.
A question came into play of whether or not a profitable market opportunity existed for a new energy beverage brand to be produced, marketed, and distributed by the company in 2008. With the company’s current strengths, business strategy, and positive reputation, it would seem to be a good move. But one must first consider the competition, customer, and if the company itself can successfully introduce a new product to a specific market. The company has several succinct strengths. They have a strong portfolio of leading consumer- preferred brands. This means that they have a diverse portfolio of bottlers, distributors, and retailers with a wide variety of products and provide a foundation for growth and profitability. Their Snapple brand is also a leading ready to drink tea. Overall, in 2007 more than 75 percent of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. volume was generated by brands that hold either the first or second position in their category. The strength of these key supporting brands has served as a platform for lunching innovations and brand extensions in the past such as Accelerade RTD, a ready to drink sports drink that launched in late May 2007.
The company therefore had experience in what it truly meant to create a new branded energy drink which would serve to be useful, as the strategy would be similar. Entering a new product market. A second strength the company possesses is their Integrated Business Model. This provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interest of its brand ownership and its bottling and distribution business. Thirdly, they have strong and long standing customer relationships. This is so important for the success of a company. They have a wide range of strong relationships from bottlers and distributors, to national retailers, large food service, and convenience store customers. They also have strong relationships with some of the most important U.S. retailers including Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, and Target. Another strength is their attractive positioning within a large, growing, and profitable market. They hold the number three position in the United States, Canada, and Mexico beverage market. The company has a great competitive edge, as they cater to the need for convince and the demand for product with health and wellness benefits more so than any of their competitors.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. also has a broad geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage. They have 21 manufacturing facilities and approximately 200 distribution centers in the United States. The company has strategically laced their warehouse at or near bottling pants and geographically dispersed them across sales regions to ensure company products are available to meet consumer demand. This enables them to better align their operations with customers, reduce transportation costs, and have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches. Another strength is their strong operating margins and significant stable cash flows. The breadth and strength of the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. product portfolio has enabled the company to generate strong operating margins, which combined with relatively modest capital expenditures, have delivered significant and stable cash flows. This in turn creates stockholder value by enabling the company to consider a variety of alternatives, such as investing in its business, reducing debt and returning capital to its stockholders. Lastly, they have an experienced executive management team. They all have an average of more than 20 years of experience in the food and beverage industry.
The team has a broad experience in brand ownership, bottling, distribution, and enjoys strong relations both within the industry and with major customers. They also have diverse skills that support operating strategies, including driving organic growth through target and efficient marketing, reducing operating costs, enhancing distribution efficiencies, aligning manufacturing, bottling, distribution interests, and executing strategic acquisitions. Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. realized they had a weakness, as they were the only major nonalcoholic beverage company with no energy drink brand of their own. They also recognized an opportunity, no company had yet positioned themselves as an adult energy drink. Going into the Energy beverage market also seemed to correlate with what their future and current goals were. Industry analysts were projecting an average annual growth rate of 10.5 percent from 2007 to 2011. Also, since their current demographic was more health conscious then the competition, which gives them a competitive competency, they also had another untapped opportunity to market their energy drink by differentiation.
Currently, there are five major competitors that dominate the U.S. energy beverage market: Red Bull North America, Hansen Natural Corporation, Pepsi-Cola, Rockstar Inc., and Coca-Cola. Pepsi and Coca-Cola also compete with what Dr Pepper already offers from an industry and market point of view. Sadly, when it comes to advertising funds available, Dr Pepper has some funds available, but not nearly close to what Red Bull has. With that being the case, we feel that an avoidance of the competition, by going the route of a product innovation technique by means of differentiation, would be the best route for Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. to be successful.
There are some warning signs in the industry. The energy beverage market has experienced product proliferation and price erosion in recent years. Proliferation resulted from line extensions new packaging and size, and market segmentation. Existing brands also typically offer regular and sugar free verities which have a sizeable share already in the market. Brand position typically emphasizes an energy boost, metal alertness, refreshment, and taste. This is why our product differentiation positioning is so important for the brand to be truly successful.
Several opportunities for product differentiation exist. One of which are the ingredients. Specifically, a new brand could augment the energy and mental alertness benefits by increasing the amount of herbs, vitamins, and natural ingredients. Secondly, no brand has positioned itself as an adult energy drink. Adults between the ages of 35 to 54 consumed energy beverages at a rate that was only slightly less than consumers under 24. Thirdly, the packaging. All the energy brands on the market lacked meaningful differentiation. They all looked the same. With the product, they felt it would be smart to introduce a new drink with a re-sealable lid, something that would stand out in the crowd. The current energy beverage consumer typically consists of males between the ages of 18-24. Energy beverages are most often consumed in the afternoon, the second most popular time of day is morning consumption. Convenience stores and supermarkets are the dominant off-premise retail channels for energy beverages.
In general, energy beverage manufactures with a broad product line and an extensive distribution network have had the greatest success in gaining shelf space in supermarkets and mass merchandisers for their brand. This would correlate with Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. strength of having great relationships with their vendors. We would recommend that they follow suit with partnerships with the dominate off-premise retail channels, but as a more health conscious beverage. The solution that we came up with for the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group was to incorporate all of these opportunities into a new product called RAM, which stands for Real Alive Micro-Nutrients. The product’s target market will be adults ages 25- 44 both males and females, who are interested in their health. In specific we are targeting the working middle class.
Our average consumer would be someone working long hours that need constant energy throughout the day, even after work when they need to go home and take care of their families. They are constantly on the go and busy. When developing a new product you must implement the marketing mix. The first being the product, RAM energy drink. Our product is focused on providing the same alert and energized feeling as traditional energy drinks, without including ingredients that have harmful side effects. Other drinks such as Red Bull can lead to dangers such as cardiac arrest, headaches, insomnia, type two diabetes, and many other health issues (Top 10 Energy Drink Dangers). Our new product RAM, will be replacing ingredients that lead to these dangers with more vitamins. For example our product will not include ingredients such as Carnitine, Guarnana, Ginseng, and Ginko Biloba. All of which are commonly used in energy beverages but there presence is not clearly reflected on their labels. Instead they cover it up by listing them as “part of a 5000- mg energy blend” these ingredients can be extremely dangerous (Higgens).
Instead, we will have ingredients such as Iron, Biotin, Zinc, Omega -3 fatty acids, antioxidants, Vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12, C, D. All of these attributes to healthy energy levels but are a more natural way of doing so. Another detail of RAM will be lower calories, right now out of the five leading companies in the energy beverage market, not including sugar free products, Monster has the lowest calories being 200 per 16oz can. We want our product RAM to be around 150 calories per bottle, with only about 25 grams of sugar. Compared to Monster, which has 54 grams of sugar. RAM will also only be made up of natural flavors with no added artificial flavors or colors added, whereas the other lead competitors all ad coloring and most admit to adding artificial flavoring when some do not list the specification, which usually means they are trying to hide something. We want our customers to know every little ingredient that makes up RAM and hopefully this will build trust and relationships in return.
Many people are just now starting to notice all of the potential dangers that energy drinks contain, which is why our product will stand out as a healthier choice that offers the same benefits. The look of our product will be completely unlike any other energy drink, which are usually un-sealable cans. RAM will be sold in a 17 ounce recyclable cardboard bottle with a re-sealable screw on cap, similar to those that Vita Coco coconut water uses. This type of bottling will fit better with the target market’s lifestyle because the container will be easier to bring on the go with no spills or messes. They are also able to drink some now and easily save the rest for later. When designing the prototype of the bottle we choose the colors dark blue and black so that they would be gender neutral and attract the more mature market. The label is also clear and easy to read. We suggest that RAM only starts off introducing two flavors and see how they perform and introducing a new flavor within the next 8 months of the campaign.
The two flavors to start with might be RAM berry and citrus, because they are common and consumers might be more willing to try. From there they can extend the product line even further by offering a sugar-free option and even being sold in packs of four or large cases. The next aspect of the marketing mix to look at with RAM is pricing. We think that it is best to price themselves competitively at about $2.15 a bottle. Which is only a few cents cheaper than drinks such as Monster and Amp depending on the location. The third part of the marketing mix is place. Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. has a wide range of strong relationships from bottlers and distributors, to national retailers, large food service, and convenience stores, such as 7-11, and their customers. They also have strong relationships with some of the most important U.S. retailers including Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, and Target. Building on their current strength of market channels, we felt that off premise retailers would represent the best choice for the product to be carried. Lastly, we have to figure out the promotion that will be used for RAM.
Since our funds are low compared to competitors, and we are going to avoid any conflict, we will be focusing on giving out samples while the product is being first introduced. We recommend the company hires sales reps to go to local grocery stores, with whom they already are doing business with, to give out samples to customers for them to try the new drink. It would also be a good idea to promote the new brand at events such races, athletic games, and concerts that our target market would be attending. This can be as simple as setting up a tent offering free samples and coupons. We also recommend using social media as a platform because it is extremely cost efficient and we can easily select our target. By means of analyzing the company’s strengths, tactics, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats, we were able to come up with a product that would be successful.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. vision statement says, “It is our vision to be the best beverage business in the Americas. Our brands have been synonymous with refreshment, fun, and flavor for generations, and our sales are poised to keep growing into the future.” We feel that by building on their current strengths and marketing a product by means of differentiation through its ingredients, demographic, unisex packaging, and partnerships with loyal vendors, we will have a success with RAM. Real, Alive, Micro-nutrients.

28 Jul 2017 --- Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. has reported second quarter 2017 EPS of US$1.02, which included a US$0.18 per diluted share loss on early extinguishment of debt, compared to US$1.39 in the prior year period. For the quarter, sales volumes increased 4 percent, including the Bai acquisition. Reported net sales increased 6 percent, including the Bai acquisition, which accounted for just over 1 percentage point of net sales growth.  

Total Bai brand sales growth contributed just over 2 percentage points of net sales growth. Organic net sales growth was driven by an increase in organic sales volumes and favorable product and package mix, which were partially offset by the termination of the Rockstar distribution agreement.  DPS President and CEO Larry Young said: “I'm proud of our teams for delivering strong top-line results for the quarter. We remain committed to our priority brand strategy, as demonstrated by our increased marketing investment. We also invested further in activities to deliver increased trial of Bai and are encouraged by the results so far. Our CSD portfolio once again outperformed the category, growing both dollar and volume share in measured markets. Our allied brands continue to contribute strong growth to our business, and we're driving growth and productivity with Rapid Continuous Improvement.” In CSDs, Dr Pepper increased 2 percent, driven by growth in both regular and diet. Canada Dry grew by 6 percent, and Schweppes grew by 4 percent, both on continued growth in the ginger ale and sparkling water categories. Peñafiel increased 8 percent and Squirt grew 7 percent. 7UP increased 5 percent, growing in both the US and the Caribbean. A&W was flat, and other CSDs declined 1 percent. Fountain foodservice volume was flat in the quarter, as 2 percent growth in Dr Pepper was offset by an account specific limited-time offering a year ago. Beverage Concentrates Net sales for Beverage Concentrates increased 4 percent in the quarter on a 2 percent increase in concentrate shipments and concentrate price increases taken earlier in the year. Lower discounts further increased net sales as the result of favorable trade accrual adjustments in the quarter that were partially offset by unfavorable product mix. SOP increased 3 percent driven by net sales growth, which was partially offset by increases in marketing investments due to marketing accrual adjustments. Packaged Beverages Net sales for Packaged Beverages increased 6 percent in the quarter on favorable product and package mix, mostly due to growth in NCBs, including continued growth in the company's allied brands, a 4 percent increase in organic sales volume and growth from the Bai acquisition, net of the loss of Rockstar. SOP decreased 6 percent as results of the acquired Bai business, excluding the distribution profits within the company’s distribution system, were a loss of US$10 million, including US$20 million of marketing investments, US$2 million of amortization of intangibles and US$1 million of transaction expenses.  Latin America Beverages Net sales of Latin American Beverages increased 11 percent in the quarter on a 6 percent increase in sales volumes and higher pricing, which was partially offset by unfavorable product and package mix. SOP was flat in the quarter, as sales growth was entirely offset by higher commodity costs, unfavorable foreign currency transaction effects, inflationary increases in certain operating expenses and increased planned marketing investments. In the quarter, the segment incurred US$4 million of higher US dollar denominated input costs, which caused a 17 percent decline in SOP.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
