The King Oscar export brand was founded in 1902, when King Oscar II, ruler of Norway and Sweden, gave Chr. Bjelland & Co (no), one of Norway's leading canning companies at the time, special royal permission to use his name and likeness on a line of sardine products.[1]
Over the years, the King Oscar brand expanded into new markets, introduced new product lines, and was eventually acquired by several different parent companies as the sardine canning industry evolved in Norway. Today, King Oscar AS is owned by Thai Union Group, one of the largest seafood producers in the world.

History[edit]
In 1880, Norwegian fish canneries began exporting sardines.[2] At the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893, the Norwegian exhibition included smoked sardines.[3]
In 1903, a year after the royal permit had been granted, Chr. Bjelland & Co. first began exporting the King Oscar brand of sardines to the United States, and by 1920, the brand was established in the US and British markets.[4] In 1965, the company started exporting their sardines to Japan.[5]
Chr. Bjelland & Co. produced a ten-minute film called "Sardine fishing" in 1909 to market the brand; this was the first Norwegian commercial. The company also used the slogan "Out to conquer the world".[6]
In 1950, various King Oscar brisling sardine products were accorded kosher certification.[7][8]
In 1981, eleven Norwegian canneries merged to form a single company, Norway Foods, which acquired the King Oscar brand. Norway Foods was in turn acquired by Rieber & Søn ASA in 1996. Over the following years, the brand was introduced to various European countries.[9]
In 2008, King Oscar's central production facilities were moved to a facility in Gniewino, Poland. The company continues to maintain a production facility in Svolvær, Norway.[10]
King Oscar AS became the new owner of the brand in 2009. The company was purchased by Procuritas Capital Investments in 2010, and by Thai Union Group in 2014.[9][10]
Products[edit]
While sardines have always been the company's flagship product, it also produces a variety of seafood products including brisling and Baltic sardines, herring, mackerel, salmon, tuna, cod, and specialty items, as well as fish salads and fish pâtés.

Soles and Heels

This gives lightness in weight & appearance that the welted construction cannot.Moccasin ConstructionThis provides a very light flexible & comfortable shoe. A bag of Leather is formed by Hand stitching an apron & the sole is then stitched or glued to the upper.

Sizing

This size guide is only useful for converting formal shoe sizes from one measurement system to another. If you convert a casual or trainer shoe size, you are unlikely to get a good fit in a formal shoe.Shoes that are made to fit the same size foot will vary in physical size due to differences in last (shoe) shapes. For this reason we cannot measure shoes to fit your feet. US customers need to be aware that UK sizes are different to US sizes. For example, a US size 6 customer should order a UK size 5 or 5.5 as this seems to be the approximate difference we see.   UK USA EU   5 5.5 39   5.5 6 39.5   6 6.5 40   6.5 7 40.5   7 7.5 41   7.5 8 41.5   8 8.5 42   8.5 9 42.5   9 9.5 43   9.5 10 43.5   10 10.5 44   10.5 11 44.5   11 11.5 45   12 12.5 46   13 13.5 47

The sole is stitched to a welt which means the shoe gives great comfort & excellent shape retention.Welted Rubber solesThis is similar to the “Goodyear welted Leather sole” construction except the sole material is Rubber giving harder wear & better water resistant properties.Leather Sole Rubber Fore Part This gives all the benefits of a leather sole but the added flexibility & durability of a rubber fore part.Cemented Leather SoleA construction using specialised adhesives in place of stitched welts to bond the upper to the sole. This gives lightness in weight & appearance that the welted construction cannot.Moccasin ConstructionThis provides a very light flexible & comfortable shoe. A bag of Leather is formed by Hand stitching an apron & the sole is then stitched or glued to the upper.
