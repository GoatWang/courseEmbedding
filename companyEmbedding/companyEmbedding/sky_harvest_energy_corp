Sky Harvest Energy Corp.

December 20, 2013
             Oil & Gas, Renewables


By Ania Swiatoniowski
There are exciting new things on the horizon for Sky Harvest Energy Corp (OTCBB: SKYH). As a power generation company, the company’s main focus is on utility-scale renewable energy. Sky Harvest has been making a mark in the energy industry by announcing a string of positive developments in the past several months.
 Sky Harvest, based in Vancouver, develops wind power sites and designs and manufactures vertical axis wind turbines.
 Sky Harvest announced their latest of several developments on December 5, 2013: it will begin a new relationship with the Northern Centre for Advanced Technology for testing and manufacturing Sky Harvest’s vertical axis wind turbines. The company is also involved in establishing projects in Turkey in underground natural gas storage and the European energy industry.
Developing Wind Sites in Saskatchewan
Sky Harvest is a development stage company founded in 2005.  It has been developing three utility grade wind power sites in south-west Saskatchewan: Birsay, Beechy, and Matador Pasture — Matador Pasture is within the Beechy area. The company currently holds long term lease agreements and contractual interest in these areas –comprising over 35,000 acres– and are permitted to build wind power generation facilities on these lands. Birsay and Matador Pasture will each be approximately 175 MW facilities.
 Sky Harvests interests in the Saskatchewan wind sites are the product of over eight years of investment in engineering and environmental studies conducted by firms prominent in the wind power industry. These studies began with the inception of the company in 2005. Sky Harvest owns two subsidiary companies in Saskatchewan related to the wind sites: Keewatin Windpower Inc. and Sky Harvest Saskatchewan Corp.
 William Iny knows the complexities of developing a wind harvesting site. Iny started at Sky Harvest in 2005 as a director and became President and CEO in 2010. “Saskatchewan is a dynamic place for wind,” says Iny, as he explains why south-west Saskatchewan is a particularly good place for wind harvesting. “You have the cold air from the Arctic descending and you also have warm air from the Gulf of Mexico ascending up towards the North Pole. Where that air exchange happens is right over Saskatchewan.”
 These winds are highest in south-west Saskatchewan, which is why Sky Harvest located there in 2005 and began research into the viability of establishing wind sites in the region. Iny indicates his confidence in the sites saying: “I think we hit the sweet spot there and we made a long term commitment to develop those projects.”
 But Saskatchewan has other attractive qualities to a wind energy production company. The Saskatchewan government has identified wind power as part of their energy solution for their growing energy needs and are developing their long term wind strategy. There are already five wind farms in Saskatchewan, but wind only accounts for 8% of energy production, while fossil fuels account for 75%. Iny believes that wind energy will increase as dependence on fossil fuels decreases.
 Sky Harvest is currently developing the Matador Site, a lease for which they hold from the Government of Saskatchewan. Two meteorological towers have been erected in the region. Sky Harvest holds a government lease for another five years.
 “Everything we do is very long term and we want to make sure that it fits in with the developmental objectives of the provincial government and with SaskPower,” says Iny as he talks about the position Sky Harvest takes in the province. Sky Harvest recently sold one of their former Saskatchewan-based wind projects, the Birsay site, to a major Canadian company for CDN$8million.
Design and Manufacture of Vertical Axis Wind Turbines
Sky Harvest is currently developing a 5 kW-size vertical axis wind turbine designed for smaller wind that would be implemented onto transmission towers and communications towers, but also to power remote communities.
 “The inquiries we are getting right now are from all over the world, especially Europe — that is very strong on wind — from India, the Middle East, and from Northern Canada where many communities are still powered by diesel,” says Iny, explaining the market for the 5 kW turbines. The small turbines would provide cleaner energy in remote communities and lessen cost associated with transporting fuel to these regions by helicopter.
 Sky Harvest plans to expand their 5 kW vertical axis wind turbine manufacturing arm of the company into Europe and Asia. “We’re having discussions with several countries who are interested in a licence to manufacturer there,” indicates Iny. The small turbines are under research and development and have already been awarded multi-patents.
 Sky Harvest’s latest announcement, released December 5th, 2013, is an agreement with the Northern Centre for Advanced Technology, NORCAT, located in Ontario. The 70,000 square foot research and development centre provides advanced facilities such as those for product testing in harsh and extreme environments and underground mine testing areas, both of which represent environments where the turbines would be placed. Sky Harvest’s subsidiary company, Sky Vertical Technologies Inc., designs and manufactures the vertical wind turbines.
Natural Gas in Europe and Turkey
Besides Sky Harvest’s developments in Canada, the company has its eyes on new opportunities in the natural gas industry in Europe and Turkey. Levant Energy, Sky Harvest’s company in Turkey, has made concrete movements in this direction.
 Petroleum products en route to Europe transit through Turkey which makes puts these operations in a strategic location and allows Levant to look toward developments related to natural gas deposits off the coast of Israel.
 “We recognised that we were limiting ourselves somewhat with just wind power. We started out as an alternative energy company, which we still are, but everything becomes interrelated at one point. Natural gas has an impact on wind. Oil prices have an impact on prices of natural gas. Everything is essentially interrelated…. Many times you can’t provide energy with just one solution, such as wind or solar or hydro. We wanted to expand our horizons to harness the different energy sources that are available.”
 Nine years of commitment, hard work, and considerable investment are paying off for Sky Harvest and 2013 has been a big year for the company in all three of the company’s areas of work: developing wind sites in Saskatchewan, vertical axis wind turbine development, and pursuing possibilities in the natural gas industries in Europe and Turkey.
 Sky Harvest Energy Corp is a United States and British Columbia reporting public company.
