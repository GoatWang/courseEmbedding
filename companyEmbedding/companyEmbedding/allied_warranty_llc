In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 11/13/2013
            

                BBB has determined that Allied Warranty, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Inspired by companies like Beck’s Prime, Southwest Airlines and some other honest institutions, Allied Home Warranty (AHW) claims that their company was started to serve homeowners as a resource that can be used for the smooth running of their homes.? 


AHW is a company that has a lot more to offer than just warranty products. Some of the other services they offer are pest and termite control, home rekeying, home alarm installation, landscaping, mortgage refinancing, AC / heater tuning and a lot more. The company has a full time customer service facility, however after-hour requests have an additional fee.?The company hosts a well maintained website that offers all the basic online services required by customers. Plan details, sample contracts, facilities to sign up and become members and purchase plans, place requests etc can be done through their website.?


For homeowners, the plans are as follows:Basic PlanPremium Plan (Higher coverageBoth plans charge a service call fee of $50?For realtors too, AHW has two different plans to offer:
Buyer’s PlanSeller’s PlanThese plans have features similar to the homeowner’s plans. However they have a few additional benefits. AHW claims that homes with their plans sell 50% faster and avoid unnecessary delays.?The New Construction plan is a unique product by AHW that is designed to cover newly constructed homes. The price starts at $595 for a term of 4 years. Such plans are meant for houses whose Builder’s warranty has already expired.

 This is the worse company in the world. I had my HVAC system go out within a few weeks of me buying my house. The unit was 11 years old and passed the inspection. Allied Home Warranty only paid 20% of the total cost to have the unit replaced. The excuse they used was they only pay for a broken part not the unit. I have a complaint into the Texas Real Estate Commission since they govern all home warranty companies. Run don't walk away from this company. view lessThis is the worse company in the world.

 To add to my earlier review; the proper place to file a complaint against Allied Home Warranty is the Texas Real Estate Commission. Search for "trec residential service company" and file your complaints there.

 Here is how the Allied Home Warranty scam works. They have a "The One-page contract." Three lawyers I showed it to laughed. They said it is one page because it is so vague that it doesn't require Allied to do anything. When you have a problem you will call Allied How Warranty because you think you have a warranty with them and will get some sort of benefit over calling someone else. Wrong. Allied will send our their own contractor. The name on the truck isn't Allied, but they are owned by the same person, Andrew White. The contractor will come out for a $60 fee. You would pay about that if you picked someone at random. You aren't getting a special price. For that $60 Allied's contractor won't actually do any work, but they will over-quote the cost of repairs by as much as three times the actual cost. Then they will tell you that you get a small token credit toward the repair, but only if you use their contractor to do the work. So, if your water heater breaks they may tell you it will be $1,500 to replace it, but they will give you a $300 credit because of your warranty. You could have hired your own repairman to do the whole job for $600, but Allied will not allow this of you want the $300 credit. So, $1,200 for Allied to do the work or $600 to just have it done yourself. The BBB wouldn't even accept my complaint against Allied. The BBB gives them an A+ rating in part because of the low number of complaints they get. The BBB doesn't like to rate its members low because it hurts their business model. Search for "BBB pay for ratings." ABCNews and CNN have both done stories on the BBB scam.

Andrew White established and/or bought Sweat Equity Partners, Allied Warranty, Lone Star Repair, Geovox Security, HomeTool.com, Sweat Energy Services and NRG Energy. They are all the same. view lessHere is how the Allied Home Warranty scam works. They have a "The One-page contract." Three lawyers I showed it to laughed.

 Very disappointed with their service. Paying $60 deductible is like to get a repair quote for $60. Most of the time on the market, you can get "Free" quote from other repair companies. I paid $60 for the call fee, $175 for access fee (cut a hole of 12x12 inch dry wall to see what's wrong with plumbing), and then $160 for diagnosis fee. I was told that Allied only covers the "repair" cost. So when it comes to figure out what's wrong, you have to pay the vendor. So in a word, I spend about $400 just to get an answer from the NRG company (Allied hired NRG), that this could be the refrigerator problem. So they left with a big hole in the ceiling and they can't do anything. So I had to pay another $60 to get the appliance vendor to come and check it out. And then I was told that the pan attached to the refrigerator is leaking. Then Allied told me that the pan of the refrigerator is NOT covered. Thus, I spent total of $455 just to learn that there is nothing they can do! How do you like this experience? Additionally, they wanted to charge me additional $200 if I want to get the service ASAP 

The people who answered the phone is polite and professionally.  view lessVery disappointed with their service. Paying $60 deductible is like to get a repair quote for $60.

 After being a loyal customer for several years and paying for a warranty on 5 properties I've decided to change warranty companies. After my last experience where my ice maker can not be repaired or replaced - they will only cover the cost of a replacement ice maker which does me no good. It took weeks for them to finally tell me this after the repair person stated that it clearly shows from his notes that they should cover the entire replacement. The person that notified me was rude and did not care that I was frustrated. It's obvious why they are NO longer on the top 10 list for home warranty companies.  view lessAfter being a loyal customer for several years and paying for a warranty on 5 properties I've decided to change warranty companies.

 Moved into my home for three weeks when the AC went out. Allied service company came out and to replace the unit was over $8000. Allied paid only $1600 leaving me to pay $6500. Every brochure they have shows this to be covered. Nothing but lies but I do intend to fight this.

 I have used Allied for two years. In the past the service has been OK for minor stuff. This time we had a problem with toilets, called them and they assigned a plumber who has able to shop up 5 days later. 
I sent Allied and email, never heard back.
The plumber shows up, then called me asking for an extra $75 for a sewer stoppage issues.

Two days later I got another call from the plumber saying it needs hydro jetting and they will call me back. I called the insurance and they said hydro jetting is not covered because it is maintenance or due to a pre-existing condition, even if it is the recommended solution to solve the sewer stoppage, which is explicitly called out in their one page contract.

It's been two weeks and the problem is not solved and the insurance is not willing to pay anything. It would have been more efficient to take care of it myself.

I am canceling my contract today

 I wish I had read this feedback prior to continuing my "service" with Allied. I'm the chump. We've had Allied for 3 years with no major needs, just regular maintainance until this summer when our AC went out. Since we weren't habitual claim submitters I felt like we should of been taken care of, nope. Same issues as everyone else so I won't repeat, but liars and scammers are all that work there. No one ever knows anyone else in the company, it's always another department's fault for delays and "buck passing". Dispicible humans who have ZERO compassion for living conditions that are supposed to be insured. They offered to pay $500 of a$6000 repair. It looks like I'm starting to see a pattern. They pay $500 of whatever, no matter the actual cost. The problem is I've paid more than that in monthly deductibles. I'll take the $500 loss, cancel my policy and move on. view lessI wish I had read this feedback prior to continuing my "service" with Allied. I'm the chump.

 Website works reasonably well but quality of contractors is horrible. After repeated issues with only partial payments on water heater, oven-range, and HVAC the most offensive violation was sending an HVAC contractor who performed work that ultimately would not pass inspection. Only eight months after last repair on our HVAC system we sold the property and the heater would not pass inspection. We contacted Allied who informed us the previous contractor would "no longer work on condos" (after 5 separate repair trips on our equipment) and Allied was unable to source a new contractor to attend to our issue. We quickly and easily sourced a contractor not authorized from Allied who informed us the previous repairs were incorrect, inferior and in fact would not pass inspection. It cost us $4,000 in cash repairs to meet a basic inspection in order to sell the home. Allied would not respond to our inquiries or return our calls. Incompetent company management. view lessWebsite works reasonably well but quality of contractors is horrible.

 Just an update almost 4 weeks after my AC went out... they called TODAY to schedule a repairman. The repair was done weeks ago.... paid by yours truly. Allied is no better - if not worse - than any of the others. Save your money - put it in the bank and if you don't have a repair, you will still have it.

Save your money - put it in the bank and if you don't have a repair, you will still have it. If you do, at least you haven't paid for the warranty AND the repair, because they  ... view more

 Waited on phone for over 30 minutes to set up appointment. Waited more than the 4 hours they said a vendor should contact me within. Vendor ( Rayford Refrigeration & Air) finally called me. He checked my a/c and told me my a/c was frozen. I told him no it wasn't because my son had come by and checked the unit and it was not frozen, and while my son was there I had him change out my filter. The vendor told me it was frozen but since I had changed the filter it had unthawed, and cracked the pan, and he would have to come back Monday and fix it. I checked for the cost of that and it is between $300 & $500 dollars to change out the pan. I told him that I did not think that was the problem, that I thought the drain pipe was stopped up. He said he did no even think of that, and he would check that. Heard him (I guess) taking out screws to something, and he said no it was not stopped up, that pan was cracked. This was on Friday evening. By Monday had not heard from Rayford Refrigation, so I called them. He told me they had to first call Allied Home warranty, wait to see if they had the go ahead to fix the a/c. By Wednesday still had not heard from them so I called Ellis Air & Heat. By Wednesday at 4 p.m. (same day I called Ellis,) technician came out in uniform and company van with tools, and honestly within 15 to 20 minutes had diagnosed and repaired my a/c. Guess what was wrong. STOPPED UP DRAIN. I had to pay Rayford a $60 service fee & no repair. I paid Ellis $70 with repair and checked out my unit. Rayford needs to refund me my $60, and Allied needs to return my premiums for a year. Canceling my contract with Allied and calling Reliant Energy to tell them what kind of people they are telling and selling that we should RELY on. What if my a/c had been frozen? I would have been week without a/c in Dallas in 100 to 103 degree temperatures. It is too dangerous to open doors and windows. view lessWaited on phone for over 30 minutes to set up appointment.

 This company is a complete cheater. We all have got cheated hence a word of advice.
If you buy a home warranty from this company it is absolutely waste. When you will have a repair they will say most of the repairs are excluded from the coverage hence you will have to pay 80% of the cost. When 90% customers write bad reviews it is not a way to go forward, however if you do, you will have to pay for your ignorance. In short, all this company does is

 Terrible customer service and wait time. I have two TVs that are waiting repairs due to the last major storm in Dallas, Tx almost three months later l am still waiting on the reimbursement. Can't tell you how many times l called to complain about the lack of urgency or what seems like the lack of consideration of the company.

 We have been with this company for about 5 years, have had several service requests, mostly plumbing. Service response has always been prompt and service provider has been excellent. 
I see a lot of bad reviews that are just not at all consistent with our experience. Have to wonder if some of those are trolls sent to denigrate the company. Just wondering, I don't know, all I know is our service has been very good and I would recomment this company to a relative or friend. view lessWe have been with this company for about 5 years, have had several service requests, mostly plumbing.

 My contract changed without the company notifying me of these changes. When I spoke with a supervisor he said I could take my business to another company and if I wanted to file a complaint to write to the legal department. The changes to my policy was significant. My rates increased and service coverage decreased. HATE THIS COMPANY!!!

 I cannot believe I stayed with this company so long! The coverage is non-existent and the customer service is horrible. They tried to charge me $2500 to have a water heater replaced (just MY portion, not what they covered!) and then they wanted me to pay $3500 for a new furnace (again just MY portion) when it was really only $1500 through an actual HVAC company. Run don't walk away from them!

 Service itself was fine - timely and professional. BUT, the captive water heater they provided at $1,150 with a 6-year warranty is available retail for about $500 - same model and warranty We had what was described as the highest warranty they sold - $1,000 - which means that the over-priced heater already put us $150 out of pocket before considering the other installation costs. Entire out-of-pocket cost was $707, could have been less than $100. We are contacting the company for an explanation and will pursue a remedy if needed. Why should we pay double the cost of the unit? This is a total rip-off. BTW, when we called in the A/C warranty two years after a lightening strike burned out a motherboard, well, guess what, that isn't covered. What a surprise. Estimate cost: $1,200. We got it repaired for $100. view lessService itself was fine - timely and professional.

 WARRANTY BUYER BEWARE: I have recently purchased a new home and received one year of home warranty from Allied. So far we have made three service requests (for $60 a piece). Long story short for the first two was that the items needing repair were to far gone but they would be happy to sell us new systems (furnace and hot water heater). The third is the worst yet. The refrigerator that came with the house failed. A claim was filed and a technician sent (for $60 of course). The technician looked it over and couldn't do the repairs then but had to go back to get approval to do the repairs because he thought it was on the boarder of repair vs getting a payout for the fridge.He said we would get a call back that afternoon. After not hearing anything for a couple days I called allied to inquire on the process and was told that the repair request was approved and they were trying to get a hold of the service technician to schedule the repairs. Allied would call back me that evening to follow up. No call back. A couple of days pass by and I call to inquire again about the progress of the claim. Im told that the claim is delayed because they can not contact the service technician but the operator Im speaking with will get ahold of the technician and personally get back to me that evening. No call. I call yet again, with the same expected response...we can t get a hold of the technician. Two weeks after my initial call I am contacted but not about the repairs but a request for a copy of my home inspection. I sent it in and there is no indication of any deficiencies with the refrigerator. I hear nothing. A few days later I call to inquire about the claim and I'm told that the claim has been declined. They claimed that it was a pre existing condition and not covered. How an item in a home that I have just purchased has a pre existing condition is beyond me especially since it was not discovered on the home inspection. But what really gets me is that it took them three weeks to inform me that they won't fix it even though I was told earlier that it would be. Now after being without a fridge for three weeks with a newborn at home (forgot to mention that. That made it even more fun) we get to go get a new fridge out of pocket. Thanks for nothing allied. It really appears that allied is really just a front for their affiliate NRG to sell installation and service of new overpriced systems and appliances. I will be advising my realtor to steer anyone away from allied. Their services (or lack there of) are not worth it. Anyway do yourself a favor and avoid Allied home Warranty. After all they avoid doing anything for you. view lessWARRANTY BUYER BEWARE: I have recently purchased a new home and received one year of home warranty from Allied.

 I would NOT recommend this company to anyone. Not only as a homeowner but as a Realtor. Getting repairs done in my home has been a 3 week process, which mostly involves me making calls almost daily between the vendor (who is horrible too) & Allied to make sure the ball keeps moving. Most of my frustration comes from the vendor that they chose, Extreme Home Appliance Repair. They NEVER answer their phone, I can honestly say I have called about 30-40 times and left messages 75% of the time; I have NEVER gotten a call back & they have only picked up about 4 times. When I told Allied about their horrible customer service they told me that they were having a hard time getting a hold of them as well.. Ummm.. why use them as a vendor if this is an issue?? I read numerous reviews online and everyone said the same thing.. They don't answer their phones and don't come back out to finish repairs.. Why would my home warranty company even have this vendor as an option?? Anyways, when I call Allied all they tell me is they are letting the appropriate departments know about what's going on.. I've asked for followups and calls back and have Never gotten one from Stephanie whom seems to answer the phone every time I call, I also asked to speak with a manager and have yet to receive a call back from her (Tara). If I didn't call everyone every other day then I would never get my items repaired. 

-Horrible customer service, no returned calls/followups
-Poor choice of vendors 
-Inability to get a claim taken care of in a timely manner. 
-I was told they don't cover anything that is wrong with my ovens, yet haven't been given a repair price even though I have called several times asking for it. 

Do NOT use this warranty company, they have inconvenienced me not only by their lack of customer service but also because I haven't been able to use my ovens for the last few weeks. 

We will not be renewing our policy or recommending this company to anyone. view lessI would NOT recommend this company to anyone. Not only as a homeowner but as a Realtor.

 I am a Realtor and I had an issue with my air-conditioning units at my home. When I found resistance with the Allied technician and call center to replace them for a reasonable price, or give a decent credit, I gave the Allied sales team a call to help me with the issue. 

I was ready to quit recommending Allied to my clients based on my experience with the technician and call center. When I told the Allied Team about my concerns, they jumped right in and helped me come up with a solution. 

I was extremely impressed with how quickly they jumped onto my issue and got me in touch with Jim Woods, head of the HVAC dept., who was also amazing, and even brought me portable AC units to use for the weekend so that my kids could sleep in their rooms.

The solution that we all came up with was a great one, and I am very pleased with the results of their hard work and willingness to work with their customers. 

The next call to the Allied Team was dealing with one of my client's issues. They had a major plumbing repair came up and they also had concerns with the pricing and technician's proposed solution to their problem. You took my client's issue with the same sense of urgency, and it was greatly appreciated. view lessI am a Realtor and I had an issue with my air-conditioning units at my home.

 As a realtor, you want to have a prompt and positive outcome when your clients have a problem after just moving in in a home.

 The air conditioner went out on Sunday, 7/26,2015. I called Allied Allied Home Warranty on Monday and was scheduled for Wednesday. NRG came on Wednesday and repaired the system. The system died on Thursday. Today, Friday,7/31/2015 I called Allied Home Warranty for service and was informed that I am scheduled for Wednesday 8/5/2015 between 12-2. If I need service earlier, I will have to pay for emergency service which is $120. I paid Allied Home Warranty $60 on Wednesday 7/29/2015. Today, it is expected to be 101 degrees in Seabrook. Prior to NRG's repair, the fan was blowing so their was some cool air, now the system is dead. I will not pay $120 to Allied Home Warranty as I they were paid $60 less than 2 days ago and air conditioning is a priority in Texas. Waiting until Wednesday for service is abuse. view lessThe air conditioner went out on Sunday, 7/26,2015. I called Allied Allied Home Warranty on Monday and was scheduled for Wednesday.

										I have been a long time client of AHS and I am eternally grateful for the service.  The representatives are willing work with you to schedule appointments and provide outstanding customer service.  This has been my experience and I would recommend AHS to family and friends.  I have not had to rely on them often but when I do, it is a relief to know they are there.

										We have used American Home Shield on several different appliances and also our heat pump.  They have always sent professionals out within 24-48 hours and repairs have been made timely and always met our approval.  We really appreciate the idea when something goes wrong we don\'t have to worry about finding a repairman because they take care of it for us.  Our stove top could not be repaired so it was replaced.  Great savings too us.

										Great service for me. I\'ve called First American before and have not had any problems. This time had A/C problems. The technician diagnosed the problem very quickly, after I explained what it was doing. My A/C unit was repaired in 20 minutes -bad capacitor. I did have one small beef to say that it did take a week to get out to the job. But maybe that\'s probably due to few tech\'s for their area. Maybe they could refer to another service co. as a backup. Thankfully we had a window unit to help keep the humidity down while we waited.

										They are well worth the money for at least the first years until you rebuild your savings. My oven and dishwasher literally stopped working 3 months after I bought my house. They were quick! Fixed my oven and replaced my dishwasher.

										hearing a salesperson tell you something and then actually experiencing it really confirms to me this companies commitment to its customers. When I purchased this home warranty the salesperson I spoke to told me that they get service to you in 24 hours on average however some cases it can take 48 hours but that is the norm. So last Monday when I placed a claim on my AC at around 8am and a serviceman shows up at my house at 3pm i really felt the level of service. Finally a salesperson tells you something and a company really backs it up!

										They have been there for me and my tenants in every way. We have 3 homes we own other than our own home and we depend on this warranty whenever something breaks down in any of our homes those of us who have tenants know its not easy owning a house in another state and having tenants so the warranty is a important factor in owning a house for me and the service from this warranty is absolutely  the best i have ever had. They respond fast get things working fast my tenants are very happy and I\'am very happy.

										My fridge stopped working so i called HSC to make a claim. It was great the lady in customer service was very professional and made sure to get a service repair guy out to my house the next morning I explained her that we really need to get our fridge back up its a priority in our house as it is in every home. Sure enough at 10am the next morning there was a serviceman in my home working on my fridge. Two hours later my fridge was working like new.

										Last night when I got home from work my garage door would not open, I made a service request online and this morning I got a call from a garage door repair person. He set up a appointment with me and my wife was home only until 11:30 am he said not to worry he will be done by then and he was. He replaced the garage door opener thankfully my wife was not late for work.

										I recently filed a sprinkler claim with SHW. They processed my claim quickly and had a technician at my home to make repairs. The technician was professional and explained the issue. He told me what he did to repair it so that the issue doesnt happen again. I was very happy with the technician who was hired by SHW.

										Had my first service call on my A/C unit on hottest week we had in Las Vegas and they got someone out the same day. Was fixed and up and running that evening. Fortunately my repair was done with only the service fee. 
									



Chris - PA  - 2017-07-19

										I received HSA from the seller for free when I purchased a house.  So far I had to call them for a hot water tank issue and furnace issue.  The hot water tank after a couple visits and part replacements eventually got replaced with a bran new one.  The plumber gave great service and was prompt and I had no issues with his service or HSA\'s service.  The furnace was the same way.  It ended up being an easy fix but still the service was great on by both HSA and the repair tech.  Even if I would have paid for the HSA warranty it would have paid for itself in a few months.  I definitely recommend it for anyone buying a new house.  As for someone who is really handy or has been in their house for a while it really depends on the shape of your appliances.  The warranty is a little pricey to have everything properly covered but  it definitely helps when something unexpected happens,
									



Joseph Reyes - OH  - 2017-07-19

										I have had nothing but the best experience with our HSA home warranty.  Buying a home is stressful enough, but having the peace of mind knowing that problems can be fixed is priceless!!

Yes, customer service can be tough to get on the phone.  It is very frustrating, but once on the phone they are professional, and very easy to deal with.  They are also very responsive in giving updates on repairs once in progress.

The website portal to start a repair is effortless, and is the easiest way to go.

We have never had an issue getting our repairs completed, or having competent individuals complete the work.  In today\'s world everyone wants their issues fixed instantaneously, but the reality is sometimes it takes time.  As long as you are cognizant that things break at the most inopportune time, and you have to take a deep breath and go through the process; you will be fine.  All of our service provider have been professional and exception in their repair process.

I will continue to renew our policy for as long as HSA will allow!!
									



Vicki - MO  - 2017-07-17

										Our air conditioner quit on a Saturday morning and I called HSA. By Sunday morning I had a call from the vendor and they made an appointment for Tuesday. They  sent the picture of the technician, for safety sake, and called to tell me he was on the way. He came, repaired the Air Conditioner, told me I needed freon, as well, added Freon and left. It was great. 
									



Rich M - MO  - 2017-07-13



2017-07-13
										
										When the company was HSA I found I had more trouble contacting the company and getting a service provider called to my house, but since the company was recently overhauled the service has been great!! My contract went up in price, but for the service it is worth it for me. Having a home warranty has definitely saved me thousands, this is the truth. Some repairs I have needed include ac system, garage door, dishwasher, water softener and plumbing, and my house isn\'t that old, just regular stuff that breaks down. HSA is worth it!

Chelsea Pollard - TX  - 2017-07-18



2017-07-18
										
										Don\'t have many people who cover my area so that\'s been a issue for me personally.  The service from landmark employees has almost always been super pleasant they are very friendly and easy to discuss issues with. 
									



Angus MacMillan - UT  - 2017-07-11



2017-07-11
										
										After having, but never using this warranty for alomst a year, I had a regrigerator and swamp cooler go out in the same week...No problem I thought, I have this home warranty the seller included in the price of the home. Unable to reach anyone by phone or email after many attempts, I finally opened an online service request. The next day I was contacted  by a refrigerator repair company telling me the soonest they could get out was a week from today. That was not acceptable so I tried calling landmark at least 5 times, waiting on hold for ever... opened up a chat window from their website..... which remained inactive for a full 45 minutes, and  sent them emails from both their website and directly with zero response. 

I did not hear from anyone except to receive an email that they had charged my credit card $60 for the fridge repair order. It was not until I threatened to give them a poor review that I got a somehwat personally directed email. To cut a long story short,  I ended up cancelling both service tickets and booked service myself with people coming out in two days vs a week. In both cases the service fees for the onsite calls were less than the $60 deductible from Landmark and both fees would credit against any repair cost.

In closing.... I am not sure that anyone actually works at Landmark other than in their WEB team. I think the company is a shell and like the Wizard of OZ with has a few  short wizards pulling knobs and dials behind a large LANDMARK HOME WARRANTY web curtain.

My advice...put $100 / month in the bank for repairs and forget about buying Landmark home warranty.

									



Erica Schaefer - TX  - 2017-07-10

										Once I placed the service request I received a call regarding my request within 20 minutes, it was July 4th. The next morning the service technician was out and everything was fixed. Easy questions to answer, great customer service. 
									



Jocelyn Durant - TX  - 2017-06-01



2017-06-01
										
										I have had Landmark since April. I have since had to use them twice, the first to have the house rekeyed and had the most amazing service from Landmark and the service provider. The second service request for was the dishwasher which stopped working which we discovered after closing. Landmark provided excellent customer service throughout this process with prompt follow up, efforts to find and locate parts and contacting the service provider when needed. They were able to solve my challenge with a pay out. I have been extremely satisfied with Landmark Warranty and would highly recommend them to others!
									



Heather - TX  - 2017-05-31



2017-05-31
										
										This is the second home we have warrantied thru Landmark. Our experiences have always been positive. Most of our claims have been appliance repairs (fridge and washing machine). 
Some of the contractors have been better than others but all seemed adequate and several were outstanding. If there have been delays in repairs it is typically because a part had to be ordered or because the issue occurred on the weekend when contractor was not working. You cannot fault the warranty company or even contractor for that! My thought is that if I\'m able to get what would otherwise be an expensive out of pocket repair completed for a minimal charge and a few days wait then I\'m getting what I paid for. I have been pleased with the polite and helpful staff at Landmark when I\'ve placed calls about a service request. If everything continues as it has thus far, I expect to continue doing business with Landmark for years to come.

Frank D - TX  - 2017-07-21



2017-07-21
										
										They have been excellent for me. They are very courteous and professional. I have dealt with Marc in sales and this nice lady Jasmine in the claims service section. They are always really friendly - even when I have called in all aggravated and flustered that my Air Conditioning stopped working. I got a call from the AC repair man about 90 minutes after I hung up with claims. I thought about giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because the repair man couldn\'t fix the issue on the spot when he came out because he had to order a part - then I thought to myself, that to hold that against them would be pretty unreasonable. So, based on my experience I rate them 5 out 5 stars and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a home warranty company. 
									



Joan H. - TX  - 2016-09-27

										This company lives up to its name (365). They are always available. I used them twice. Both times I called around midnight and happy I get to speak to a live person. The repairman came out quick and was good too. Very professional. SO far so good. I\'m a happy customer. 
									



Christina Rodriguez - ID  - 2016-05-30

										Defintely a very convenient service. I bet you would never find another contractor that responded so quickly when something broke. Getting a warranty plan from 365 Home Warranty is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.
									



Virginia G. Couch - CT  - 2016-05-26



2016-05-26
										
										There was a plumbing emergency at my house and I made a call to 365 Home Warranty’s hotline number as instructed when I need assistance. Someone picked up right away and started the claim for me. A technician came by the next day and fixed everything pretty quickly. Definitely happy with 365.
									



Thomas T. May - AZ  - 2016-05-24



2016-05-24
										
										I was originally looking for a repair man who could fix my oven for a low cost. I came across 365 Home Warranty during my search and I am so happy I found them. First I was able to get on a plan and have a technician come fix my oven within a few days. It ended up being cheaper than what several contracters had quoted me.

										My emergency well pump issue was fixed very quickly and dealing with HWA was very easy. They didn\'t try to low ball me and paid exactly what the contract called for!

										The service repair man assigned to my case was extremely professional and very quick to respond. He is the only repair person I have ever had show up early for the repair! I was impressed with his knowledge and the efficiency with which he assessed the issue. I would call him again in the future for sure!

										The owner/technician who attended to my dishwasher and microwave problems was very prompt, courteous and professional.  Definitely knew what he was doing.  Always called if he was going to be a few minutes late and kept in touch regarding when he could get approval, parts, and attend to the problem.  Very satisfied.

										I am completely satisfied with the service I received from Home Warranty of America.  My hot water heater was leaking, the technician stated that it needed replacement, an estimate was submitted to Home Warranty of America, and the install was complete!  I could not be more satisfied.  I did have to pay a small amount OOP for drip pan and reserve tank to bring it up to code, but it was minimal.  Very happy customer.

Looking for more? Request for a new company to be added OR check out  companies that have gone out of business.Want to know more about our ranking process? Check How do we rank Home Warranty Companies.Please be advised that customers who are dissatisfied with their home warranty program are more likely to voice their opinion than those who had no complaints. So, you will see more negative reviews here than positive ones.
Another reason for dissatisfaction is that some consumers realize that the warranty would not cover pre-existing and lack-of-maintenance problems only after they file a claim. Home warranty companies are listed below. Choose the offer that fits your needs and get a price quote before buy the insurance policy.
Notes and Disclaimers

The weighted average sorting uses an advanced Bayesian weighting formula, listings with just a few positive ratings won't outrank those with many high ratings and a few negatives.
This is not an extensive list of providers. Please check your local listings to find out about the coverage in your area.
 Premium and deductible pricing info was taken from internet resources and maybe outdated. Please call insurance provides for latest pricing info
Neither do we endorse any of the providers, nor do we get paid by them. We try our best to keep the information unbiased.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
