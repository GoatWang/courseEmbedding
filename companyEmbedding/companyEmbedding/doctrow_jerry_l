Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Ventas Second quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Silvana and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We would be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a remainder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I will now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today Mr. T. Richard Riney, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. You may proceed sir.
T. Richard Riney - Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel and Secretary
Thank you, good morning everyone. Welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's announcement yesterday regarding its results for quarter ended June 30th, 2008.
As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions, and certain other statements to be made during this conference call, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These projections, predictions and statements are based on management's current beliefs, as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events.
The forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, uncertainties and contingencies and stockholders and others should recognize that actual results may differ materially from the company's expectations, whether expressed or implied. We refer you to the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and the company's other reports filed periodically with the SEC for a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and other factors that could affect these forward-looking statements. Many of these factors are beyond the control of the company and its management.
The information being provided today is that of this date only and Ventas expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly, any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations. Please note the quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measures contained in this presentation and its most directly comparable GAAP measure as well as the company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.
I will now turn the call over to Ms. Debra Cafaro, Chairman, President and CEO of the company.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Rick, good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants and welcome to our second quarter 2008 earnings call. I am pleased to be joined in Chicago by my Ventas colleagues.
Ventas's balance sheet and operations are continuing to perform well, despite the sobering conditions in the financial, economic and housing market. We are finding selected healthcare investment opportunities of manageable size from the credit list dislocation that should provide our shareholders with excellent risk adjusted returns. And we are maintaining our full year normalized FFO guidance of $2.75 to $2.82 per diluted share.

For the quarter our earnings were excellent and our liquidity position and balance sheet remain exceptionally strong. Today we'll discuss our earning portfolio performance and expectations for the balance of the year. After Rick Schweinhart reports on our financial results, we'll be happy to take your questions.
This quarter normalized FFO per share was $0.71, a 4% increase over the first quarter. During the quarter, we sold assets that generated a gain of over $26 million we also reached an agreement to sell five senior housing assets in a transaction that will likewise result in a gain on sale. The pending sale price of $62.5 million represents an attractive cap rate of 6.5% on operator EBITDAR at the assets and our rents. Those transactions provide liquidity for us to recycle into attractive investment opportunities.
On the investment front, we have recently made about $173 million of new investments, these include a newly opened medical office building that was in lease up during the second quarter and should generate un-levered yields to Ventas of over 9%. And as we foreshadowed in prior conversations with you we also purchased two pieces of healthcare debt at a discount this quarter.
We are currently in an interesting investment market because debt returns, which are safer than equity returns can exceed equity cap rate in certain selected situations. This is principally due to the desire by lenders to sell debt securities even when the debt is excellent quality, well secured and high performing. So this inversion of normal investment metrics makes us interested in buying or originating limited amounts of health care debt because we believe it can provide our shareholders with the superior risk adjusted return. Our goal is to make manageable, multiple investments in quality health care operating companies, where we believe we are in safe capital structure collateral and repayment position.
With that as background, this quarter we purchased $112.5 million principal amount of debt in skilled nursing provider Manor Care, for a substantial discount. The loan piece we acquired is secured by a first mortgage on 339 assets and represent 38% loan to value on those assets. So it is very secure with great cash flow coverage of over three and a half times. The unlevered yield to maturity is 533 basis points over LIBOR. Likewise, we purchased $50 million principal amount of corporate debt in HCA, a premier national hospital company for less than $45 million. This HCA investment should produce un-levered yields to maturity of over 9%.
Please note that we are not trying to time a bottom or trade debt securities, rather we are averaging into a dislocated debt market in a measured way, in companies and assets we understand and know, working with motivated sellers of the debt and taking advantage of opportunities we seek to produce superior risk adjusted returns for our shareholders.
Turning to a portfolio review, our triple-net lease assets continued to perform well. The Ventas triple-net lease portfolio is stable and secure, with solid occupancies and cash flow to rent coverages across the spectrum at independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. Our triple-net lease portfolio of 416 assets accounts for 54% of our revenues and 76% of our NOI.
A particular note: Kindred just reported an excellent second quarter to follow its great first one. Kindred's management deserves a lot of credit for operating the company so well and focusing on quality care for patients. It is also very gratifying to see that Kindred and Ventas can succeed at the same time, which is a goal both management teams have worked long and hard to accomplish.
Specifically reporting on our 203 Kindred healthcare assets, the cash flow coverages at our four Kindred master leases are excellent at 2.2 times. Kindred's full balance sheet stands behind its rent obligations to us. And the combination of long-term acute care hospitals with skilled nursing assets in our master leases, provides additional reliability to our forward cash flows.

In May, our Kindred annual rent increased by $7 million or 3%. As an additional benefit to our Kindred portfolio, CMS recently announced that the skilled nursing care providers will receive a 3.4% rate increase for fiscal year 2009, which begins October 1, 2008. Obviously this is a positive development for both Kindred and Ventas. All in all then, we are quite pleased with our diversified triple-net lease portfolio, which is delivering steady reliable growing cash flow from a variety of tenant operators and asset types.
Next I would like to discuss our operating portfolio. Our 79 Sunrise assets and our medical office buildings provides a granular highly diversified revenue streams in our portfolio. Because we received the benefit of NOI in these assets, overtime they should also give us a lift in earnings and a classic real estate inflation hedge. We first want to review our Sunrise portfolio, which is principally composed of need-based mansion style assisted living communities developed by Sunrise.
These communities account for 42% of our revenue and 19% of our total NOI. The headline is that these 79 high quality private paid senior living communities are producing solid results in a difficult market. During the first half of the year, total community NOI exceeded $71 million. Our pool of stable Sunrise asset now consist of 74 communities. For those 74 stable Sunrise communities, second quarter 2008 average daily rate was up 5.5% year-over-year and essentially flat, sequentially. Occupancy debt in Q2 2008 from 92% to 91% in the stable portfolio.
We are currently seeing a modest up-tick in occupancies in our stable communities during July. We are encouraged by this upward trend, but it is too soon to determine whether the trend will continue for the second half of the year. We also have five new Sunrise communities leased up, including the large independent living asset in Toronto, known as Steeles.
Importantly, these five leased up communities we owned for the full first and second quarter of 2008 showed excellent second quarter results. NOI increased in these five assets by 131% in the second quarter to $1.2 million, versus $0.5 million dollars in the first quarter. Breaking out the four U.S. mansion assisted living communities in leased up pool. These four communities showed a sequential occupancy increase of 5 percentage points, going to 75% in the second quarter, versus 70% in the first.
Our new Steeles independent living community in Toronto, which is in early stage leased up is progressing nicely. The community is 50% occupied within one year of opening, consistent with our earlier projections, we expect this asset to be cash flow positive by late 2008 and to stabilize in mid to late 2010.
So to sum up, Sunrise the first half NOI performance of our 79 communities is generally tracking our expectations. Occupancies were lower in the second quarter due to general economic conditions, but shows signs of improvement. And we are looking toward a generally consistent NOI performance from the portfolio in the second half of the year assuming stable economic conditions. If our communities produce that results, 2008 Sunrise NOI will fall within the $140 million to $145 million of guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.
Touching briefly on the medical office building portion of our portfolio, it contributed about $3.5 million of NOI to Ventas during the second quarter of 2008, and average occupancies have increased sequentially. Our medical office building portfolio accounts for 3% of our revenue and about 2.5% of our NOI. It includes 20 assets mostly on campus containing approximately 1.1 million square feet.
On the investment front, we continue to see plenty of opportunities, large and small across the spectrum of healthcare and senior housing real estate. We are being selective in determining what to invest in, when to invest, and what to pay. We are being patient while asset level pricing, debt costs and operating fundamentals come into focus. Among other things, the medical office building joint venture we discussed last quarter is producing identified development opportunities that we are currently underwriting.

We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility in 2008. We expect to make selected additional investments during the second half of the year to continue to move the company forward and create value for our shareholders. Our goal remains to provide our shareholders with consistent superior return in the context of a sustainable, profitable and low risk enterprise.
With that I'll be happy to turn the call over to Rick for the review of our financial results. And then we'll open the call for questions. Thank you.
Richard A. Schweinhart - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Debbie.
Second quarter 2008 normalized FFO per diluted share was $0.71, compared to $0.70 in last year's second quarter and $0.68 in the first quarter of 2008. Second quarter results were better than the first quarter, mainly due to improved triple-net lease revenue due to escalations, improved Sunrise NOI well developed by decreases in property level of expenses. Our $1.6 million lease termination payment fee increases in loans receivable and investment income. Less interest expense slightly offset by higher G&A and increased share count due to our February equity rates.
Second quarter FAD per diluted share were $0.68, compared to $0.65 in last year second quarter and $0.64 in the first quarter. Normalized FFO this quarter totaled $98.7 million, compared to $82.1 million in the second quarter of last year and $92.4 million in the first quarter of this year. Normalized FFO and earnings are reported after deducting minority interest. Normalized FFO for the second and first quarters of 2008 and the second quarter of 2007 exclude the net benefit of $4 million, $10 million, and $6 million respectively of income tax benefits and merger related items.
Normalized FFO increased $17 million from last year's second quarter, recently due to acquisitions. Revenue increased $42 million; of that $6 million was due to rent increases and $36 million due to Sunrise properties, resident rental and services fees.
Normalized FFO increased $6 million from the first quarter of 2008. Revenues increased $2 million with resident rental and services fees, basically flat. And rent escalations in MOB revenues accounting for the increase. Sunrise property level expenses totaled $69.3 million for the second quarter and $143.6 million for the first half of the year. Second quarter expenses benefited from property level expense credits and expense reconciliations such as property taxes, insurance, and corporate allocations.
Interest expense was essentially flat with the second quarter of 2007. Interest expense decreased $400,000 from the first quarter of 2008, due to repayment of debt. Our second quarter effective interest rate of 6.6% improved slightly from 6.7% in the second quarter of 2007 and was flat with first quarter of 2008.
General, administrative and professional fees including stock-based compensation for the second quarter of 2008 totaled $9.6 million, consistent with our expectation of $36 million to $40 million annually. On February 1, 2008 we issued $4.5 million common shares producing net proceeds to the company of $192 million. As a result weighted average diluted shares grew to $138.7 million in the second quarter, up from $136.7 million shares in the first quarter of 2008. We currently have $93 million outstanding on our $850 million revolving credit agreement and unused capacity of over $750 million. Our debt to total capitalization is excellent at 36% at quarter end and our net debt to pro forma EBITDA is 5.2 times.
Our guidance for 2008 remains between $2.75 and $2.82 per share. Our key assumptions remain the same. The total Sunrise NOI from our 79 assets range from a $140 million to $145 million and SG&A extends approximately $36 million to $40 million. Our guidance does not include other unannounced acquisition or divesture activity. Our second quarter showed stable growing results and we look forward to continued stability and modest growth during the balance of 2008.

Operator, we will now take questions.
Question And Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. You may proceed, sir.
David Toti - Citigroup
Hi, this is David Toti here.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Welcome.
David Toti - Citigroup
Thank you. Couple of questions around the balance sheet, what you believe is your sort of maximum capacity or appetite for structured finance portfolio at the top end?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Are you asking us what our capacity is or our appetite for making investments in debt?
David Toti - Citigroup
Yes. Basically, if you are buying debt pieces and pieces of the capital structure; how do you see that portfolios popping out or maturing?
Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer
Hi, David, this is Ray Lewis. I think as Debbie mentioned in her opening remarks, we think there is a good opportunity in the market right now to generate good risk adjusted returns for our shareholders by investing in debt. That having been said I mean it will always be a relatively small portion of our portfolio, and I don't foresee us really having any more than say 5% of our total value in a debt portfolio at any one point in time.
David Toti - Citigroup
Okay. Are there loan loss reserves established for these?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We are really at the leading edge of this program; and so as required, we would establish reserves. But at this present time, there are none.
David Toti - Citigroup
Okay. And then I'm just sort of moving over to sort of a transaction environment; are you seeing an increase in sort of distressed opportunities across respect from of investment areas?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I mean the areas, the healthcare areas that we participate in, skilled nursing, hospitals, independent and assisted living and medical office by and large are showing good defensive characteristics and are generally performing quite well. So there are very limited, if any, distressed opportunities in our sector unlike some of the more classic commercial real estate basis.
David Toti - Citigroup
Okay, yes that was my expectation as well. And just a sought of a detail question relative to some of the debt that you purchased; I think it was the $100 million piece. That appears to have a higher yield than some of the debt that was structured in the same transaction that's lower in the capital structure, can you provide some color on that?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We can, I mean again I think we are trying to be patient about our acquisition opportunities although again not timing the market just waiting to see when we can buy manageable slices of what we believe are really secure debt pieces at returns that we think are attractive. The market changes everyday in these securities and so we are trying to make intelligent manageable investment.
David Toti - Citigroup
Great, thanks for the color I will get back in the queue. Thank you.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay, David; thanks.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Hi, good morning. First just a question on Sunrise, you mentioned that you have some expense declines there and the margin improved quite a bit sequentially. Is that a trend or is that just a one-time event that happened in the quarter?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, the way we are looking at it, Karin, is that we are sort of expecting a full year of NOI to be in this sort of 140 to 145 range, and so we would expect that margins would go back to a more normalized level in the second half.

Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Okay, fair enough. Second question is on the guidance. You had a good quarter, you had the lease termination fee and you made some pretty attractive investments. Just curious to why you left guidance the same, and what if anything offset some of the positive things that may have moved guidance somewhere upward?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, the reason, that we kept guidance the same is that we are trying to give the market our best expectation of where the year is going to out as it always is and that's really the range where we expect our earnings in FFO to come in. And in terms of... if we expect a sort comparable second half from Sunrise to the first half and we had already included in our guidance originally the investment of about 150 million cash that we had on hand. So, it would really take additional investments to kind of move the needle. And if we find those, and then that will be great and we will advice the market at that time.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Okay fair enough, final question the credit statistics that you gave on the mortgaged debt investment was really helpful. Do you have similar or any type of credit type indications you can give us on the HCA debt?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We can, I mean those are corporate bonds, so it's different... a little bit little animal, [ph] but in terms of the company HCA itself they have interest coverage of over two times and they're about six times levered. So they're doing quite well and obviously the premier hospital company in the nation. So we feel good about that as well.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Okay, thanks very much.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Karin.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Rob Mains from Morgan Keegan. You may proceed
Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.
Yes. Excuse me thanks. Good morning. I just a follow up on the question on Sunrise NOI. Could you either, I don't know if you can quantify or just give a little bit more depth into what went into the expense reductions or I guess those were reductions, but kind of reverse those in the quarter?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, I think Rick touched on those; they are basically things like property taxes, insurance and so on.
Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.
What happened was that they were closed or were reversed, what exactly caused the expense to go down?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, again basically as we told, when we acquired the portfolio, we expect the quarters to be lumpy, and we are really looking at this portfolio and the NOI performance over the course of the year. And so basically we are expecting sort of we had $71 million NOI, sort of first half and then we are expecting sort of a comparable second half on the NOI line.
Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.
Right. I understand. I just wonder if this seasonal pattern we should be looking or is this kind of like...
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No, I mean, again I think it's expected lumpiness and I think you'll see sort of revenues and expenses, both trend a little higher in the second half.
Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.
Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
Yes, thanks, and good morning everybody.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Rich.
Unidentified Company Representative

Hi Rich.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
In terms of REIT, do you now take the assets out of your TRS and free up space there? And if so is there any financial impact as a result of that?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good question for those of you who are not REIT geek like I am; the idea is...
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
You are not calling me a geek, are you?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I called myself one.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
Okay.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Theidea is to build that would just pass to benefit the REIT industry that had a number of positives in it among them, the tax free subsidiary cap is raised from 20% to 25% of you total value. And in addition, there was healthcare prong up the statute that gives healthcare REITs structuring benefit as we go forward. And some more tax efficiency and planning.
And when we acquired Sunrise, we were able to do under existing law and in compliance with existing law. But as Rich alertly points out, I think the idea will give us a benefit of moving some of the assets around internally to create a more tax efficient structure over the long term. So we won't see any immediate financial impact but over a longer period of time it will result in more tax efficiency.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
Okay. And just on the topic of Sunrise, you guys are really into the mansion product, but can you comment about how the Sunrise business is done across its different price points and where mansion might stack or some of the lower quality types of products?
Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer
Sure Rich, this is Ray, I think that if you've listened to Sunrise's comments recently, you will know that they are really refocusing their efforts on the mansion product going forward. And I think that it speaks to the fact that is sort of the best product in their portfolio primarily because it's a purpose built product around the Sunrise operating model. It tends to be the case of our portfolio. It is located in high period entry infill locations and major metropolitan markets. As the consequence, you tend to see the mansion portfolio and if you look at ours as an example generating higher average daily rates, performing a little bit better in absolute occupancy. And so I think that speaks well to the quality of that product type relative to their other products.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
Okay. A small one here. But I think I saw this right that merger related costs, even though it's on your nominal measure, normalized measure of FFO. But it went up second quarter versus the first. Why did that happen? And is there anyone to take from that?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I can answer that quite simply. In that line is our litigation costs, rising out of the merger and so now that we are in full swing of discovery. Those costs are going up that's why.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
You mentioned that your plans to sell five assets to a current tenant, seems like you are not... does that tenant... does it start with the letter K?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No... no, it doesn't. But if you would like to buy a vallow [ph]... no it doesn't. It doesn't.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
Okay and then last is on medical office, with 3% of the portfolio it really seems like this has been an area, where you probably wanted to be bigger by this time in medical, correct me if I am wrong on that. But it just seems like that has been a part of the investment conversation for the past year or so. And still pretty small percentage of the total. Are you sort of happy with this or are you frustrated that you are not, just like, say 10% of your business at medical office. I mean can you comment on that... on the environment and what sort of slowed it down?

Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer
Well, I think Rich, you are right. I think if you to ask me a year ago, I would have said we probably would be a little bigger than we are right now. But we are being patient and we are focusing on opportunities that build important relationships that will help us to grow this portfolio in the future. And more importantly, focusing on doing deals that are going to make money for our shareholders. So I am actually happy with where we are. We have a number of good relationships that have led to multiple transactions we announced. Development deal in the first quarter. We are making progress. We are doing the things that we want to do and we are well positioned when we find those good opportunities to count on them. So it's a patient strategy. I'm pleased with what we are doing. And hopefully as we continue to execute, the portfolio size will grow and profitability will follow.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-on. What would you... how would you quantify your existing dry powder today as we progress?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we saw it basically less than $100 million of spending on the revolver and the capacity there is 850. And in addition, our credit stats are about five times debt to EBITDA. So that looks pretty good and has leverage capacity as well. So, I think we are in pretty good shape there.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
So.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I feel really good about the balance sheet and I continue to think that, it's going to be an important differentiator as we go through the rest of 2008.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
So, maybe over 1 billion of dry powder?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
1 billion probably is a good estimate.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
Okay, thank you.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.

And the next question comes from line of Jerry Doctrow from Stifel Nicolaus, you may proceed.
Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
Good morning. I just had a couple of things. A lot has been covered. I think, on the Sunrise relationship, I was curious how are you are feeling about development, whether we would expect you to buy any new deals in the second half?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good question, Jerry. As you know we have an exclusive right of first offer to acquire everything Sunrise developed in Canada, and also in selected defined geographies around our U.S. assets. And we are thrilled about that. And we continue to believe that Sunrise is a great developer, particularly of the mansion product.
It was interesting, Mark Ordan said on Sunrise's call that capital is really in this environment asking for robust yields on development. And we are looking at things with them, and we'd be happy to do developments that meet our return expectations and that we think will be good development. So it is possible we will do some with Sunrise, going forward. And I think highly likely, although not necessarily within a specific narrow time period. But I think it's highly likely over time that we will partner with them on transaction.
Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
Okay. And you're right. It's not, a certain fixed deal. It just depends somewhat on market condition are.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Right. We think that they'll develop some good asset over time and that we'll be able to participate in that for the benefit of our shareholders.
Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company

Okay. And then just TRS, sort of coming back to that, I mean you talked about restructuring the existing deal. Just any thoughts about how it my used, go forward, kind of things you would think about think about doing.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I mean yes. The most important thing say though is that right here makes the healthcare REIT just like lodging REIT and neither healthcare REIT nor lodging REITs will be able to operate asset, healthcare assets, except through an independent eligible contract or as we do now with our Sunrise relationship. So we see this is as structuring advantage in deals were we might want to have the REIT through the TRS center into a management contract under the right circumstances, but we believe in the model that we have as a healthcare REIT and has offered investors and great risk reward proposition over the past ten years. And so I don't expect RIET exchanges really to result in material changes and how we operate our business. But it does give us a little bit of structuring, flexibility, cap sufficiency which we would hope to use to good advantage over time.
Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
And the results didn't change I think in the international figments too. And we definitely make something like Chartwell, potentially an easier acquisition both because of TRS and some of the other things.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We will let you study that one.
Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
But it makes REIT operator deals potentially more likely, is that fair to say?
Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer
What you mean by that Jerry? I just want to make sure.
Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
Well, you could acquire somebody's spin-off may be the manager in a private subsidy and capture upside.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I mean we could sort of do that now. I mean it's a sort of a classic prob so up, so cost structure is sort of for Ventas.
Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
Right.
Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer
Which is where the assets are held.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
It's where the assets are held and how the relationship between the two is structured, is it a lease, is it a... how is it structured and...
Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
But using a line interest better, because you can both share an income now, which you couldn't really do before, your share in bottom line.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
In appropriate circumstances.
Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
Okay, that's fine. Thanks.

And you next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein from Lehman Brothers. You may proceed.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers
Okay, thank you good morning.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Adam.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers
Just a few questions here; I guess just in terms of future assets sales, just in terms of your thoughts there. I know you guys haven't put an official number out for the year in terms of the asset sales. But just, what are your thoughts, you just talked a little about your though process on buying assets, but just curious in terms of selling off additional assets and then I've got a couple of follow-up questions.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we have been opportunistic in our asset sales program overtime. And many of the sales, not all, but many of them have been to operators in sort of win-win arrangements with them. And, we're not planning any kind of mass disposition over the balance of 2008. But we'll continue to prove and improve the portfolio and hopefully do some opportunistic things. But I don't think you should pencil in a huge amount or anything like that.

Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers
Okay, all right. And then just, I just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of senior housing. Obviously a lot of noise out there with respect to occupancy rates and just the impact that the economy is having on the senior housing sector. It sounds like your operators are still doing pretty well, but just curious to get your thoughts there in terms of how you think about that and would you have an interest in taking down your exposure to senior housing in the future, meaning to the extent you are going to put capital work would you be inclined to invest being away from senior housing, could you do a big concentration there?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we believe in senior housing and we have... most of our senior housing is in the triple-net leases. And we've seen good solid continued performance in that portfolio with some impact from the economy in the housing market really at the margin. But again in the triple-net lease structure is set up to expect operating changes. And then on the Sunrise front, we have seen, again good solid occupancies, the higher acuity product is really need based and we do believe in the business and in the growth of the business over a long period of time.
I am going to turn it over to Ray; I think you'll see us continue to grow in other areas as well as senior housing.
Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer
Yes, I mean, I think just to add to what Debbie is saying. I think the senior housing space has by enlarge exhibited pretty good resiliency in this economy. And as Debbie particularly in the need driven assisted living area. Medical office continues to be attractive from an operating fundamental standpoint. We are continuing to make investments there and allocate capital there when we find deals that are priced appropriately. I think if we look at some of the other areas certainly skilled nursing has looked attractive recently and given the fact that re-imbursements have been stable and improving over the near term and the fact that we still have a relatively modest exposure to that space. That's attractive area for us.
And then you know on the hospital front, we still think that over the long run, there is going to be a need for a tremendous amount of capital there to upgrade the real estate and technology infrastructure and re-financing can be a source of capital to help the hospital space to do that. So I wouldn't say there is any decrease in the appetite to senior's housing. And we continue to be interactive in the other areas as well.
Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers
Okay. Thank you for the details, great quarter.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And the next question comes from the line of Rosemary Pugh from Green Street Advisors. You may proceed.
Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors
Thank you. Yes, Rosemary Pugh speaking. My first question is related to the triple-net senior housing portfolio. I am particularly interested in how the independent living properties are performing in recent months and what your outlook is and I know you have talked about the portfolio in general, but how much would you... in your sensitivity analysis, how much would occupancy need to drop before your cash flow coverage covenants are crossed?

Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, the IO is a small portion of our triple-net portfolio. And we've seen, again like relatively steady occupancies across AO and IO and the triple-net, maybe going down a percentage point over the last year or so. And remember that in most of these cases and actually all of the cases, all of the assets are combined in master leases with guarantees and so on. And so we feel really good about the reliability of our cash flow, rents in the triple-net portfolio going forward.
Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors
Okay. And then related to the Sunrise portfolio, how are incentives such as free rents or waving of move in and community fees that counted for in the monthly rent numbers. So when you calculate average daily rate on a same store basis, is that including these sorts of concessions net of these?
Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer
Hi Rosemary, this Ray. There is a number of factors that go into average daily rate, one of which is equity of the residence mix. Obviously if you have people receiving more and higher levels of services on your average daily rate will vary upwards on that. But with regards to targeted move in incentives, we do have some of that in our portfolio to in selected communities to fill some vacant units. It's really geared around optimizing NOI, and making sure that we are leveraging the fixed overhead in the communities. So there is some of that going on I wouldn't say it's widespread.
Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors
Great, thank you very much.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Chris Pike from Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.
Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch
Good morning everybody.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Chris.
Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch
Hi, good morning. I guess you said you saw an uptick in the operating portfolio in July. Was that broad based or did you see any geographic focus? I guess I am just trying to get a further read across occupancy and the relationship to housing and the economy?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good, I mean I think... I will comment on that broadly and it does seem to be a relatively widespread phenomenon. Again it's something that we are waiting to see whether it's going to be a trend that's going to hold through the balance of the year. But across operators really and across product types, I think what we are seeing is the second quarter was softer than expected on occupancies, and still trending down. But then you did see in July some steady pickup. And I think HCP said on its call yesterday that they had talked to a wide variety of operators and that that all of them had seen the same trend. And so it doesn't appear to be in pockets. It appears to be a broader base trend.
Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch
Okay, but...
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
And the question is, will it continue as we look through the balance of '08.
Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch
Okay. But then once again with respect to your portfolio, the sequential changes in 2Q are really with respect to just the operating assets and like or similar to some of your peers, any other, say out trends or in off trends are really based upon 1Q data, because... yes.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
The triple-net is always... yes, the triple-net always lags a quarter.
Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch
Okay.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
But some other senior housing operators to our public had started to report. And I think they are... to the extent they are reporting... they've been saying similar things.

Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch
Okay. I guess following to Rich's question with respect to increase in merger costs relating to certain litigation efforts I guess... and just from a reporting prospective because of you definition of normalized and the white paper version of FFO, so if you were to be fruitful at any proceeds from your litigations efforts, would that be stripped out of your defined normalized FFO being you are not including them at this point?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well,I would consider that as a high class problem, and so I don't have any answer for you yet. That will be yet to be determined.
Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch
Okay.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
But it's a good question; we will give it some thought.
Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch
Okay. And I guess just lastly with respect to Steeles, and I don't know if you can really use this as a witness across lease up in general. But I guess the way that I calculated maybe its like nine units or nine residents per month, per quarter of lease up and that's pretty consistent Q1 and Q2. Are there any attributes of those residents, who are coming in that are either surprising or that are worth noting whether it be the age, the equity, maybe the time in terms of shopping and then finally signing? Is there anything there to draw conclusions from?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
A couple of comments I want to remind everyone Steeles is independent living, a very large asset. It's in Toronto. So we are happy to answer your questions, but it may have limited applicability to other situations either in our portfolio or across the industry. We had projected sort of nine or ten move ins as you point each month during the first year and then have that start leveling to a lower level over the next couple of years as we look towards stabilization in late 2010.
We did see with the... with the regional head of Canada. Recently the residents who are moving in are consistent with I think the Sunrise, a profile which is a higher income residence in the case of Steeles healthier and interested in some of the programs that Sunrise has there for healthy ageing and so on.
So again, it's kind of a unique situation that may not be... we may not be able to have broad lessons to derive.
Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch
Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Chris.
Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer

And the next question comes from the line of Hank Farris [ph] from Liberty Mutual. You may proceed.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, thanks for taking my question. You indicated as you talked about the investments unlevered returns, so you are using leverage beyond the balance sheet on those investments.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
There is no balance sheet leverage.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, and how are sourcing those ideas?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We have lots of relationship built up in healthcare and in finance over a very long periods of time. And so many of them are just coming to us and we are fairly now a few.
Unidentified Analyst
Is there any intention or desire to use some of these investments strategically beyond sort of the debt of the companies you are investing in?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
This is not a loan to own strategy; I want to be clear about that. This is a desire to make safe investments with what we believe to be superior risk adjusted returns arising out of a dislocated debt market. So hopefully that answers your question.

Unidentified Analyst
Okay and the piece of Manor Care that you bought, that's the CMBS piece?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
It's the first mortgage piece at about 38% loan to value.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
It matures in January 2012, I think.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, because there is operating company piece as well that's sort of much more distant from the assets.
Raymond J. Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer
That's right.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Right, this is defiantly the mortgage... first mortgage piece.

[Operator Instructions]. Our question is a follow-up question from Michael Bilerman from Citi. You may proceed.
David Toti - Citigroup
Hi, it's David again. Debbie, this question is for you, and I am not sure how far you want to sort of jump into this. But could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on the potential 2009 impact of shift towards Democratic control?
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, Dave. That's a good question. We have found after doing fairly exhausted research that a change in administration has had little impact on the performance of the operators over time. So, Republican or Democratic, it really hasn't had a major impact there are positives and negatives of both. And so, it's hard to draw any macro conclusions if indeed there is a Democratic administration.
David Toti - Citigroup
Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Debra A. Cafaro - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
All right. We are glad to have you on board, David. And I want to thank everyone who joined today's call.

 Terms of Use 
These Terms of Use were last modified in September 2016.
 Terms of Use and your acceptance of them. Read before continuing. 
FMR LLC is pleased to provide you with the information, content, tools, products and services on all Fidelity Sites (the term "Fidelity Sites" refers to all Fidelity web sites, as well as to the content on them). Because these Terms of Use cover multiple web sites, some terms may refer to items that are available only on certain Fidelity sites. These Terms of Use also include some important disclosures and information related to certain products and services. Your use of Fidelity Sites is subject to these Terms of Use ("Terms"). There are many different Fidelity companies ("Fidelity Entities"), and their affiliates, that provide information, content, tools, products and services on and through the Fidelity Sites. These Fidelity Entities are identified below and in each part of the Fidelity Sites where they provide such information, content and services.
These Terms are a binding agreement between you and the Fidelity Entities listed below, as well as their U.S. affiliates ("Fidelity"). By using or accessing the Fidelity Sites, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms.

 Use of Fidelity sites 
The Fidelity Sites are intended only for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you and Fidelity have agreed otherwise in writing.
 
 Fidelity sites and companies 
FMR LLC is the parent company of various Fidelity Entities. Some of these Fidelity Entities are financial services companies, that may be registered under federal or state laws, and others are not regulated as such and may, for example, provide information and content publishing services. A listing of all Fidelity Entities, that provide content on the Fidelity Sites, is listed below.
Portions of certain Fidelity Sites are published or selected by Fidelity Interactive Content Services LLC ("FICS"). FICS is a company with main offices in New York, NY. FICS seeks to present objective news, information, data and guidance on personal finance and investment topics drawn from a diverse collection of sources including affiliated and non-affiliated financial services publications. Content drawn from FICS affiliated entities is marked and labeled as such. FICS selected and published content is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by any Fidelity Entity or any third party. Certain tools published by FICS may provide general information and guidance based upon your personalized input. Securities quotes are delayed unless otherwise noted. FICS is owned by FMR LLC and is an affiliate of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, among others.
The following investments and brokerage products and services are offered through Fidelity Sites by the Fidelity Entity indicated. These four Fidelity Entities are also broker-dealers:
Retail brokerage accounts and trading products and services, the FundsNetwork® Program, and investment and workplace savings plan products and services offered directly to investors and plan sponsors are offered by:

 Professionally managed accounts 
Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service®, Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service at Work, BlackRock® Diversified Income Portfolio and Fidelity® Strategic Disciplines are services offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments Company. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios may be offered through the following Fidelity Investments companies: Strategic Advisers, Inc., Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB ("FPTC"), a federal savings bank, or Fidelity Management Trust Company ("FMTC"). Non-deposit investment products and trust services offered through FPTC and FMTC and their affiliates are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, are not obligations of any bank, and are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. These services provide discretionary money management for a fee.
 
 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, Member NYSE, SIPC and/or Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., distribute fixed and variable insurance products issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, New York, NY, and certain third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments.
 
 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.
 
 529 College Savings Plans 
The UNIQUE College Investing Plan, U.Fund College Investing Plan®, Delaware College Investment Plan, and the Fidelity Arizona resident College Savings Plan are offered by the State of New Hampshire, MEFA, the State of Delaware, and the Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education, respectively, and managed by Fidelity. If you or the designated beneficiary are not a New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, or Arizona resident, you may want to consider, before investing, whether your state or the designated beneficiarys home state offers its residents a plan with alternate state tax advantages or other benefits.
Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
 
 Information for foreign investors 
The Fidelity Sites are intended to be made available only to individuals in the United States, and the information on the Fidelity Sites is only for such persons. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites shall be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security, or any other product or service, to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction.
Persons outside of the United States should visit Fidelity Institutional, which will direct them to the appropriate overseas web site of Fidelity's non-U.S. affiliates. Fidelity's non-U.S. affiliates, Fidelity Worldwide Investments (FIL Limited), Fidelity Investments Canada Limited, Fidelity Investments Management (H.K.) Limited, Fidelity Investments Japan, and Fidelity Brokerage Services Japan LLC offer products and services designed specifically for overseas investors.
 
 Broker-dealer's potential conflicts 
As a broker-dealer, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC or its affiliates may act as principal for its own account or as agent for its customers in connection with the sale to you or purchase by you of a security that is the subject of content prepared by Fidelity. If it receives a mark-up or commission or acts as agent for another person in connection with any such transaction, Fidelity may have a potential conflict of interest. You understand this potential conflict and acknowledge that you may choose to effect securities transactions at another broker-dealer.
 
 Limitations on investment guidance and professional advice 
The Fidelity Sites are not intended to provide legal, tax, investment or insurance advice. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by Fidelity or any third party. Certain investment planning tools available on the Fidelity Sites may provide general investment education based on your input. You are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy, security or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance. You should consult your legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation.
 
 Copyright policy, linking policy and trademarks 
The Fidelity Sites are protected by applicable copyright laws. Accordingly, you may not copy, distribute, modify, post or frame-in the Fidelity Sites, including any text, graphics, video, audio, software code, user interface design or logos.
Unless you and Fidelity have agreed otherwise, links from another web site to a Fidelity Site must resolve to the top-level homepage of a Fidelity domain (e.g., www.fidelity.com, www.netbenefits.com). In order to avoid confusion if you do link from another web site to a Fidelity Site top-level homepage, your web site, and the link itself, may not suggest that Fidelity endorses, sponsors or is affiliated with any non-Fidelity web site, entity, service or product, and may not make use of any Fidelity trademarks or service marks other than those contained within the text of the link.
All trademarks and service marks on the Fidelity Sites belong to FMR LLC or an affiliate, except third-party trademarks and service marks, which are the property of their respective owners.

An identification of the allegedly infringing material, and a description of where that material is located on the Fidelity Sites;
Your address, telephone number, and email address;
A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the disputed material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information you provide in your notice is accurate and that you are the owner of the allegedly infringed copyright, or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Jerry L. Doctrow is a Managing Director of Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., and he leads 
the firm's six-person health care services and health care real estate research 
team. He has been recognized six times by The Wall Street Journal and twice by 
Forbes/Starmine as one of the best health care or real estate analysts in the 
U.S. Mr. Doctrow and his team follow 45 publicly traded companies, including 11 
health care REITs. Mr. Doctrow has over 30 years' experience in equity research, 
consulting, public policy, finance and market analysis. He spent 18 years at 
Legg Mason, where he led the health care services research team and served as 
President of the firm's real estate consulting unit, advising not-for-profit and 
corporate clients on the development of senior housing and health care 
facilities. Stifel Nicolaus acquired Legg Mason's capital markets division in 
December 2005. Mr. Doctrow served on the board of a not-for-profit agency that 
developed several hundred units of senior housing and, together with members of

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.  There may also be analyst count variations for symbols with multiple share classes and ADRs.  More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

The credit crisis is battering the two largest publicly traded operators of housing for the elderly. One of them, Sunrise Senior Living, is trying to stave off bankruptcy. The other, Brookdale Senior Living, is considered likely to resolve its short-term problems, but it faces a mountain of debt in the next few years.Both companies, behemoths in a largely fragmented industry, say they are taking steps to reduce costs but have pledged to refrain from cuts that could impinge on the care they offer their residents. Brookdale manages 51,847 units of retirement and assisted-living housing, and Sunrise has 50,235 units.Brookdale has several senior living centers in Southwest Florida, including Freedom Village Bradenton, Clare Bridge of Sarasota and Sterling House of Port Charlotte, according to its Web site.Sunrise operates The Fountains at Lake Pointe Woods in Sarasota.Once the bellwether of the assisted-living industry, Sunrise Senior Living, based in McLean, Va., has violated certain covenants imposed by its lenders on leverage ratios and has a deadline of Jan. 31 to restructure its line of credit. One analyst, Jerry L. Doctrow, a managing director at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said Sunrise might need to raise as much as $300 million next year.Sunrise's new chief executive, Mark S. Ordan, a former gourmet-grocery executive who specializes in trying to rescue troubled companies, said he did not expect to wait until Jan. 31 to work things out with the lenders."We should have an arrangement with the banks long before that," Ordan said.Ordan's predecessor, Paul J. Klaassen, who founded Sunrise in 1981 with his wife, Teresa, stepped down this month. The Klaassens, who are still heavily involved in Sunrise, are regarded as pioneers in assisted living, which provides frail elderly people with an alternative to the hospital-like setting of a nursing home. But the couple's reputation was tarnished in recent years as Sunrise became mired in accounting problems and other governance matters that drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission and forced the company to restate years' worth of earnings.The company also stumbled when it expanded into Germany and branched into new areas, including developing age-restricted condominiums and acquiring a hospice company that was later accused of fraud in billing Medicare."They have made a number of ill-advised investments," Doctrow said.Sunrise suffered a recent blow when real estate investment trust Health Care REIT backed out of a $643.5 million deal to acquire a 90 percent stake in 29 properties in which Sunrise has a minority stake, citing the stalemate in the capital markets. Sunrise was to realize at least $41 million from the deal.On Nov. 28, 2007, Sunrise's shares closed at $32.16. But since Nov. 12, it has been trading below $1, closing at 66 cents on Wednesday.Founded in 1986, Brookdale grew rapidly at the height of the real estate cycle by acquiring rival companies, doubling the size of its portfolio. To finance these purchases, Brookdale, now based in Nashville, took on short-term mortgages secured by its existing assets, and has about $1.6 billion in debt due by the end of 2012, according to Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif.Brookdale, the developer of the Hallmark at Battery Park City, a 14-story retirement and assisted-living home in Lower Manhattan, is expected to cut its dividend to meet near-term obligations. The company is also reducing corporate overhead costs, trying to sell some of its unencumbered real estate and increasing the availability of services like therapy and home health care, for which the company can charge fees not included in its basic rate.Bill Sheriff, Brookdale's chief executive, said that in recent weeks, residents had urged him to forgo renovations to keep the company from raising monthly fees, which can run as high as $10,000. "Do everything you can to control costs," he quoted them as saying.Brookdale's shares, which traded for $35.16 on Dec. 10, closed at $3.68 on Wednesday.Though the two companies are close in size and cater to the same upscale segment of the market, they have different business models. Brookdale owns or leases most of its homes, while Sunrise is primarily a management company that develops centers and then sells them to other companies while retaining a minority stake. The average monthly fee, including housing, meals and some services, at Sunrise-operated centers is $5,000.Nearly three-quarters of Sunrise's units are dedicated to assisted living, aimed at people who need help with daily activities. A majority of Brookdale's units are either stand-alone retirement homes -- where communal meals are available but the population is less frail -- or so-called continuing-care retirement communities, where residents initially live independently but contract in advance for assisted living and nursing care on the premises.The occupancy rate remains strong at both companies -- 92 percent at Sunrise and 89.7 percent at Brookdale, according to the companies' third-quarter earnings reports. Both companies said expenses had increased.In the industry in general, occupancy -- especially for retirement homes -- is weakening in areas most affected by the housing slowdown, said Robert G. Kramer, president of the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing and Care Industries, a research organization in Annapolis, Md.People planning to move into a retirement community can postpone their decision if their house does not sell. Less discretion is involved in the decision to move into an assisted-living residence, Kramer said."There's usually an event that triggers it," he said.Specialists in housing for the elderly say the long-term prospects for the sector are very good because new supply is being kept in check. "As a rule, the senior-housing industry is not developing a lot of new product," said David S. Schless, the president of the American Seniors Housing Association, a trade group. The National Investment Center found fewer than 23,000 units under construction in the 100 biggest metropolitan areas.That is a far cry from the late 1990s, when the frenzied pace of new construction far exceeded demand, in part because developers were slow to realize that most people would not move into assisted living homes until their 80s.The slowdown means that there is likely to be a shortage of such housing eventually, said Kathryn A. Sweeney, a managing director for U.S. senior housing for GPT Group, an Australian real estate company. "If you plan to be a resident, you need to be saving your pennies now," she said.
