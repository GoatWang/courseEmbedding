Enhancements



 Curb appeal goes hand in hand with a well designed landscape. Sure anyone can just put plants in the ground and trees in front of buildings but is it the "right plant for the right place"?  Having an expert horticulturist behind the designs of your landscape enables the creation of a landscape to last for years to come. We work with our clients with ideas of what they want and ultimately help guide them with the choice of plants ideal to the location of their property and environment. 
Fortunately technology has allowed for programs to be developed to allow us to take pictures of your current landscape and put together ideas we discussed and incorporate them into the program to preview what it will look like before any ground is even broken.

Water...The leading force behind living organisms as we know it. To establish the means of having a perfectly groomed lawn or landscape focuses a lot of how well your irrigation system is running. Sure having one in place and allowing it to run at any period of the day seems like no big deal. Reality is needing highly trained professional's to guide your system to its peak performance and calibrating every square inch of the system. Many times poorly maintained systems continue to have Band-Aids put on to simply damper an issue which leads to bigger problems down the road. Water conservation is a must in today's times. Properly installed heads correct overspray and prevent the waste of hundreds of gallons of water. Let us here at The Magnolia Group show you correct ways of hydrating your landscapes and properly maintaining a well balanced system.

Arbor Upkeep






 
Caring for a tree is a vital importance. Poorly maintained trees that are improperly balanced or not properly thinned allowing for air movement to pass through the canopy with great resistance is at a great risk of being blown over. The Ideal time of the year to prune is mid to late winter or at the start of spring. Reasoning for this time is due to the small amounts of foliage on the tree allowing for easier identification of diseased, damaged or pest-ridden areas to remove. 
Not only is Safety an importance but also the overall appearance of the trees. Whether its a solitary tree perched in the front of a building or to a row of trees lining a street. Poorly maintained trees create a dreary and unwelcoming place that is not beneficial to any form of business. Clean and neatly maintained trees has a positive impression on any person when viewing. With proper care and trained personnel like what we have at The Magnolia Group can help bring the WOW factor to any Dicot or Monocot your property might possess.
