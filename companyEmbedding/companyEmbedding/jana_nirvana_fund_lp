Jana Targets Juniper, Plans to Close Nirvana to New Investors


					January 24, 2014

					 
                    
				



Barry Rosenstein’s Jana Partners has
    identified a new activist target—Juniper Networks, a
    provider of telecom networking infrastructure products and
    services.

     

    The New York City-based hedge fund firm
    says in its year-end letter sent to clients that it has already
    engaged the company "on the multiple avenues" it believes could
    unlock shareholder value. The firm says it is attracted to the
    company’s "undemanding valuation, the tailwind of
    a favorable telecom spending cycle on required network upgrades
    a frustrated shareholder base and the potential for a change of
    perspective and sense of urgency from new CEO 
    Shaygan 
    Khereadpir."

     
In the letter, Jana also told clients it plans to
    close its Nirvana Fund to new investors on or around April
    1. In addition, it said it may close Jana Partners to new
    investors "sometime in the future, depending on the
    opportunity set."

     
Jana is not the first activist to move in on
    Juniper.

     

    We reported on January 14 that Paul
    Singer’s Elliott Management disclosed a 6.2
    percent stake in the company and sent a 27-page presentation to
    the board of directors laying out how it would unlock value.
    The plan includes cutting costs, buying back $3.5 
    million  of stock
    and undertaking a "review" of the security and switching
    businesses. Elliott said these moves could boost the stock
    price to $35 to $40 per share.

     
On Thursday, Juniper reported revenues that came in
    above consensus analyst forecasts.

    In the letter, Jana also disclosed new
    positions in  Equinix, Airbus and Cameron
    International.

     

    In fact, it seemed to hint of a possible
    activist campaign down the road against Cameron, a provider of
    fluid control products to the energy sector. In the letter Jana
    says management has taken several steps to "rationalize" its
    portfolio, but adds "there remains still more portfolio pruning
    to be done" and that asset sales, balance sheet capacity
    and future free cash flow "provide considerable powder for even
    more share repurchases."
In 2013, Jana Master Fund posted a 20.4 percent gain
    compared with 32.4 percent for the S&P 500.

     

    In the letter Rosenstein laments a
    number of missed opportunities amid a bull market whose
    ferocity he admits took him by surprise. He admits he
    "under-sized" some large winners so he could wait for lower
    prices that never came; exited too early from
    other  winners that overshot
    Jana’s target price; and passed on some activist
    situations that were on its radar because management took
    actions to drive returns or other activists beat Jana to the
    opportunity.

     

    Its largest gains came from 
    Groupon, Energy
    Transfer Equity and Liberty Ventures.

    As we reported several weeks ago, all
    five of its new activist positions in 2013 were
    successful—Ashland, Oil States International, Safeway,
    QEP Resources andOuterwall.
Jana Nirvana Fund, L.P. generated a 31.8 percent
    return last year while Jana Nirvana Offshore Fund, Ltd. gained
    31.4 percent.

     

    The Nirvana Fund is starting 2014 with
    $3.9 billion. Altogether  Jana has about $7
    billion under management.

     

    Nirvana was launched in April 2007 to
    co-invest in select ideas of Jana Master Fund in a more concentrated
    portfolio. The fund has fewer positions, and each position is 1½ times or more the size in Jana
    Master.

     
In 2013, its long portfolio generated a 60 percent
    gross return.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
