PEACE OF MIND
SGTi is developing fingerprint retrofit kits to be installed on home defense guns.  Once installed only an authorized user can fire the gun preventing children and other unauthorized users from firing the gun.
 

  




  



Our IndieGoGo campaign is completed but these videos still help tell our story.
 

  





  










It's Your Gun. We're Keeping It That Way.
We're developing technology through American ingenuity that keeps guns out of the wrong hands. 
Meet Our Team



230,000 Guns AreStolen Each Year
We can prevent criminals from using stolen guns. 
How We're Doing It







  

Learn more







Our Business
Safe Gun Technology (SGTi™) is putting fingerprint technology on guns.   Too many accidental child shootings and suicides by gun occur when someone gets access to a gun the owner never even intended for them to have.
Learn Our Story





Our Technology
We have patented the ability to make guns safer through the use of biometric technology that effectively will “lock” a gun, preventing any unauthorized user from firing the firearm. Our engineers are working to move this technology forward.
See How It Works





Support Us

We are seeking supporters to help us further our technology and ultimately bring it to market. Our product has clear applications across the marketplace, and we invite you to join us on our mission to make guns safer.
Let’s Work Together

Desert Eagle Mark XIX .50 AE L6 Pistol

On Target Magazine, March 22, 2017 | By On Target Staff

Despite popular myth that the .50 AE (“Action Express”) cartridge was developed by the Israeli Special Forces, it was, in fact, developed by Evan Whildin of Action Arms in 1988. The .50 AE cartridge looks a lot like the .500 S&W Magnum, albeit with a 3/8” shorter, slightly tapered case with a rebated rim. Both shoot .500 diameter bullets. The Magnum Research Desert Eagle pistol was the first firearm ever chambered for the .50 AE, and the cartridge remains a mainstay of the Desert Eagle product line.

Desert Eagle with a dual personality

RangeHot.com, March 13, 2017 | By Hunter Elliott

Magnum Research has introduced a Desert Eagle combination that comes with both .44 Magnum and .50 Action Express barrels and magazines. It was 2015 when I reviewed the Desert Eagle with the factory compensator, you can read that review by following this link. And then I was sent the factory .44 Magnum conversion kit and you can you read that review by following this link.  As you can see in the video below it is very simple to swap from .50 AE to .44 Mag and back. Keeping that in mind, it just makes sense for MRI to introduce a combo package. The kit includes a standard Desert Eagle receiver made in Israel, the .44 Magnum barrel and magazine, and the .50 Action Express barrel and magazine.

BFR Upgrades
The ‘Biggest Finest Revolver’ Continues To Impress
American Handgunner, Mar/Apr 2017 | By Mark Hampton

When you hear the term “built like a tank” it usually conjures up an image. In revolver circles, the Magnum Research BFR series can certainly be classified as tough, strong, well-built firearms — like a tank. Handgun hunters have their choice of 12 calibers in two frame sizes; short and long cylinders. These BFR revolvers are well-suited for big game endeavors when you consider rounds like .44 Mag., .454 Casull, .480 Ruger, .475 Linebaugh, .460 S&W and .500 S&W — while not overlooking .30-30 Win., 45-70 or .450 Marlin. That’s not a typo either, they do offer the .45-70 in a revolver! These cartridges entail serious medicine for any critter pursued on the planet. When I first heard about some upgrades forthcoming, well, let’s just say inquiring minds wanted to know more.

[FIREARM REVIEW] Magnum Research MR9 Eagle

concealednation.org, December 16, 2016 | By TheFireArmGuy

Let me start this review by saying, I absolutely love the MR9 from Magnum Research. If there was ever a gun that I wanted named after me, the MR9 would be that gun. This pistol has it all. It looks beautiful, has excellent ergonomics, is feature loaded and shoots outstanding. Hey Magnum Research, TheFireArmGuy MR9 Eagle has a nice ring to it.
