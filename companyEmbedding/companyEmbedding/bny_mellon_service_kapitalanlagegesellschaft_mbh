FRANKFURT, Germany and LONDON, July 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- BNY Mellon, a global leader in investment management and investment services, has signed an agreement with Nomura Asset Management Deutschland KAG1 mbH (Nomura Asset Management Deutschland) to provide fund administration and middle office services to their German domiciled funds with around €2 billion in assets under administration2.








BNY Mellon will initially provide the full suite of fund administration services to Nomura Asset Management Deutschland including fund accounting, regulatory reporting and risk controlling via its affiliate BNY Mellon Service Kapitalanlage-Gesellschaft mbH (BNY Mellon Service KAG). Further front office solutions and additional services such as collateral management are scheduled to be added in the second half of this year. 
"BNY Mellon stood out because of its ability to provide a customised package and holistic front-to-back office service," said Magnus Fielko, Chief Administration Officer of Nomura Asset Management Deutschland.

Nomura Asset Management is an existing client of BNY Mellon. In Germany, BNY Mellon also provides depotbank services and EMIR regulatory reporting services to Nomura Asset Management Deutschland which is a dedicated investment management operation of Nomura Asset Management. 
"We look forward to developing our existing relationship with Nomura Asset Management Deutschland," said Thomas Brand, Head of BNY Mellon's Asset Servicing business in Germany. "The increased regulatory emphasis on transparency, accountability and consumer protection is encouraging more asset managers such as Nomura to ask for front-to-back office services. We have invested significantly in technology to handle multiple evolving processes at greater volume and speed as well as lower cost, so are well positioned to benefit from this trend."
BNY Mellon Service KAG has shown steady growth in recent years by securing new outsourcing mandates across the traditional securities business and also in the real estate space.

Jul 18, 2016, 6:48am EDT














FRANKFURT, Germany and LONDON, July 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- BNY Mellon, a global leader in investment management and investment services, has signed an agreement with Nomura Asset Management Deutschland KAG1 mbH (Nomura Asset Management Deutschland) to provide fund administration and middle office services to their German domiciled funds with around €2 billion in assets under administration2.
BNY Mellon will initially provide the full suite of fund administration services to Nomura Asset Management Deutschland including fund accounting, regulatory reporting and risk controlling via its affiliate BNY Mellon Service Kapitalanlage-Gesellschaft mbH (BNY Mellon Service KAG). Further front office solutions and additional services such as collateral management are scheduled to be added in the second half of this year. 
"BNY Mellon stood out because of its ability to provide a customised package and holistic front-to-back office service," said Magnus Fielko, Chief Administration Officer of Nomura Asset Management Deutschland.

"We look forward to developing our existing relationship with Nomura Asset Management Deutschland," said Thomas Brand, Head of BNY Mellon's Asset Servicing business in Germany. "The increased regulatory emphasis on transparency, accountability and consumer protection is encouraging more asset managers such as Nomura to ask for front-to-back office services. We have invested significantly in technology to handle multiple evolving processes at greater volume and speed as well as lower cost, so are well positioned to benefit from this trend."

The acquisition follows BNY Mellon's purchase of PNC Financial Services Group's (PNC.N) fund services unit a month ago and is part of the company's effort to expand its market share globally this year, according to an executive.  As a result of this deal, BNY Mellon will rank second in fund administration in Germany, said Jim Palermo, chief executive of BNY Mellon's asset servicing business. The combined German business will have $642 billion in assets under custody. Before, BNY Mellon was not one of the top five fund administrators in Germany, Palermo said.  The German fund market, the third largest in Europe, "is a very important and strategic market for us," he said.  BNY Mellon is also looking to expand in China, Australia, the Middle East and Latin America, Palermo said.  BNY Mellon said the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter, will immediately add to its GAAP earnings per share.  The deal is expected to be funded internally and includes the purchase of BHF Asset Servicing unit Frankfurter Service Kapitalanlage-Gesellschaft mbH (FSKAG), BNY Mellon said in a statement.  Both BHF Asset Servicing and FSKAG will become a part of the company's asset servicing business, the company said.  BNY Mellon in February acquired PNC's investment servicing unit for about $2.31 billion. That deal added $855 billion to the New York-based company's assets under administration.  Shares of BNY Mellon were down 1.2 percent at $29.34 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange.
