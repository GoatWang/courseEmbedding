Netflix's View: Internet TV is replacing linear TV




  The following webcasts contain forward-looking statements relating to future events or future financial performance of the Company that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these statements based on a number of factors, including those identified in the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 3, 2014. These presentations may also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, where such can be done without unreasonable effort, can be found on our Web site at https://ir.netflix.com. The forward looking statements are made as of the date of broadcast and the Company undertakes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements.

	People love TV content, but they don't love the linear TV experience, where channels present programs only at particular times on non-portable screens with complicated remote controls. Now internet TV - which is on-demand, personalized, and available on any screen - is replacing linear TV.

	Changes of this magnitude are rare.   Radio was the dominant home entertainment media for nearly 50 years until linear TV took over in the 1950’s and 1960’s.   Linear video in the home was a huge advance over radio, and very large firms emerged to meet consumer desires over the last 60 years.   The new era of internet TV, which began a decade ago, is likely to be very big and enduring also, given the flexibility and ubiquity of the internet around the world.   We hope to continue being one of the leading firms of the internet TV era.  

	Internet TV Apps

	The world's leading linear TV networks now offer their programming on-demand through apps that run on phones and smart TVs. These apps, such as CBS All Access, BBC iPlayer, and HBO Now, enable binge viewing and catch-up viewing. Existing linear networks that offer compelling internet TV apps will generate more viewing and become more valuable. Those networks that fail to develop first-class apps will lose viewing and revenue.

	Internet TV is expanding rapidly because of:

	●    Ecosystem Growth: The internet is getting faster and more reliable, while penetration of smart TVs and smart phones is also rising

	●    Freedom and Flexibility: Consumers can watch content on demand, on any screen, and the experience is personalized to individual tastes

	●    Rapid Innovation: internet TV apps have frequent improvement updates and streaming is the primary source of UHD 4K video content.

	Eventually, as linear TV viewing falls in viewing and value, the spectrum it now uses on cable, fiber, and over-the-air will be reallocated to expand internet data transmission. Satellite TV subscribers will be fewer and more rural. In a few decades, linear TV will be the fixed-line telephone: a relic.

	Content People Love

	In 2017, we expect to spend over $6B on a P&L basis on content for our members. In addition we'll spend over $1B on marketing in 2017, getting people so excited about our content that they join Netflix.

	People's tastes are very broad, even in a single market. The internet allows us to offer a wide variety, and to have our user interface quickly learn and make recommendations based upon individual users' tastes. Those members who love action blockbusters, Korean soaps, anime, sci-fi, Sundance films, zombie shows, or kids cartoons will find that Netflix fills their homepage with relevant and interesting titles.

	Our licensing is generally time-based, so that we might pay for a multi-year exclusive subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) license for a given title. In each market, we license content from multiple suppliers, mirroring the fragmentation of the content industry. Typically our bids are for exclusive access to the SVOD rights, and we are up against various cable and broadcast networks, as well as online video competitors. As a rule, content owners always want another bidder, and never want one bidder to become too strong.

	Since 2013, we've been at a scale where we can economically create original content for Netflix and our offering has grown as we gain further scale and confidence. With each original, we learn more about what our members want, about how to produce and promote effectively, and about the positive impact of originals on our brand.

	We believe we have a major advantage over our linear competitors when it comes to launching a series or a film. Linear networks need to attract an audience on a given night at a given time. We can be much more flexible. Because each show on Netflix is not competing for scarce prime-time slots like on linear TV, a show that is taking a long time to find its audience is one we can keep nurturing. This allows us to prudently commit to a whole season, rather than just a pilot episode. In addition, we are able to provide a platform for more creative storytelling (varying run times per episode based on storyline, no need for week-to-week recaps, no fixed notion of what constitutes a "season"). We believe this makes it easier for us to attract creative talent.

	By personalizing promotion of the right content to the right member, we have a large opportunity to promote our original content, one that's effectively unlimited in duration. Long after the premiere of season one of House of Cards, large numbers of members are still starting the series.

	We are making great headway with our slate of original series, which is a rapidly growing proportion of our spending. Any linear network would be proud to show them. Our success is due in part to great creative execution by our team as well as the power of our large on-demand platform.

	Netflix Focus

	Netflix is a global internet TV network offering movies and TV series commercial-free, with unlimited viewing on any internet-connected screen for an affordable, no-commitment monthly fee. Netflix is a focused passion brand, not a do-everything brand: Starbucks, not 7-Eleven; Southwest, not United; HBO, not Dish.

	We don't offer pay-per-view or free ad-supported content. Those are fine business models that other firms do well. We are about flat-fee unlimited viewing commercial-free.

	We are not a generic "video" company that streams all types of video such as news, user-generated, sports, porn, music video, gaming, and reality. We are a movie and TV series entertainment network.

	We are a relief from the complexity and frustration that embody most MVPD relationships with their customers. We strive to be extremely straightforward. There is no better example of this than our no-hassle online cancellation. Members can leave when they want and come back when they want.

	We are about the freedom of on-demand and the fun of binge viewing. We are about the flexibility of any screen at any time. We are about a personal experience that finds for each person the most pleasing titles from around the world. To deliver this experience to our members, we expect to spend over $1 billion on technology & development in 2017.

	Competition

	We compete for a share of members' time and spending for relaxation and stimulation, against linear networks, pay-per-view content, DVD watching, other internet networks, video gaming, web browsing, magazine reading, video piracy, and much more. Over the coming years, most of these forms of entertainment will improve.

	If you think of your own behavior any evening or weekend in the last month when you did not watch Netflix, you will understand how broad and vigorous our competition is.

	We strive to win more of our members' "moments of truth". Those decision points are, say, at 7:15 pm when a member wants to relax, enjoy a shared experience with friends and family, or is bored. The member could choose Netflix, or a multitude of other options.

	Because the entertainment market is so broad, multiple firms can be successful. For example, ABC and NBC have historically competed for viewers, attention and content but have also successfully co-existed for many decades. Similarly, in the internet TV world, HBO is now growing faster than in years past, while our business is also expanding. Many people will subscribe to both HBO and Netflix since we have different exclusive content. The transition to internet TV, with its greater consumer satisfaction, will mean growth for many internet TV services.

	Video piracy is a substantial competitor for entertainment time in many international markets. It is free and offers very broad selection. Were video piracy to become easy, reliable, and socially acceptable, it could become our largest competitor. Global music revenues have been falling for 15 years due to large scale music piracy. Great inexpensive services like Netflix will hopefully help prevent video from following the decline of music.

	ISP & MVPD relationships

	ISP subscribers pay for internet access and expect to be able to enjoy internet TV such as Netflix. Our Open Connect program supports hundreds of large and small ISPs to directly interconnect with the Netflix network for free in regional locations, rather than going through third-party transit providers, which lowers both our costs and that of the ISPs.

	Sometimes, large ISPs want to use their market power to extract interconnect fees from us and others. We fight for free interconnection, where neither side charges the other, as we think Netflix and consumers are best served by strong network neutrality. We have made good progress in these battles, and they are usually country and ISP specific. We don't intend to try to collect a percentage of broadband revenue from ISPs, despite the fact that we are a substantial portion of what consumers do with their internet connection, and that this payment would parallel the payments to basic cable networks. Strong net neutrality, where payments are neutral between ISPs and content providers, is better for supporting amazing innovation for consumer benefit.

	With MVPDs that have an internet-capable TV set top device, such as DISH and Comcast (USA), Virgin (UK), Telus (Canada), Orange (France), Liberty Global (across Europe) and many others, we offer integrated viewing experiences (and in many cases integrated billing) which increase the use of the operator set top device. While some MVPDs want to inhibit our growth, others would prefer that our growth happen through their remote control and set top experience.

	Netflix margin structure and growth

	We think we can grow to 60-90 million members in the US, based upon our trajectory to date and the continued growth of internet TV. Our US contribution margin structure is set mostly top down. For any given future period, we estimate revenue, and decide what we want to spend, and how much margin we want in that period. Competitive pressures in bidding for content would lead us to have slightly less content than we would otherwise, rather than overspending. The same is true for our marketing budget. The output variable is membership growth that those spending choices influence.

	Our global margin strategy is to expand internationally as fast as possible while staying profitable. The group of international markets we entered first (Canada, Latin America, the UK, Ireland, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands) are growing quickly and have already become contribution-positive. These markets continue to grow and generate meaningful profits that power the expansion in the remaining world markets we launched in 2016. We are targeting a 7% operating margin in 2017 and plan to steadily increase operating profit and margin from there as we balance growth with profitability.

	With our rapid increase in content spending, and our growing emphasis on owned original productions, cash outlays are initially greater than content amortization, constraining free cash flow relative to profitability. We have generally funded these cash pre-pay needs with debt. We amortize content as quickly as justified, given industry norms and viewing history.

	Global

	Netflix is available virtually everywhere except in China, (where we will license our content for the next few years). Our growth internationally will unfold over many years as we improve our service. In the 130+ new markets we launched in 2016, we are starting by primarily targeting outward-looking, affluent consumers with international credit cards and smartphones. As with every market we’ve launched, our approach is to listen, learn and improve rapidly, adding more content, languages and a better Netflix experience over time to delight members.

	We understand that awareness of Netflix in these new markets is mixed and that there are cultural differences and some variances in content tastes around the world. There are also challenges with the broadband and payment infrastructures in certain countries. But we also believe in the growing ubiquity of the internet and rapid technological progress and that great, high-quality storytelling has universal appeal that transcends borders.

	That’s why we are increasingly licensing content on a global basis, so Netflix members everywhere in the world can enjoy the same movies and TV series, free of legacy business models and outdated restrictions. In addition, we are developing a growing number of non-English language originals from places such as Mexico, France, Italy, Japan and Brazil. With our global distribution, Netflix is well positioned to bring engaging stories from many cultures to people all across the globe.

	As Netflix expands globally, we understand that consumers and governments' expectations will rise. We expect to meet those expectations and work with policymakers to ensure that the old policies that applied to linear TV are not reflexively applied to internet TV.

	Conclusion

	We started in 1997 as a DVD-rental-by-mail firm, and spent the first five years struggling to get to a sustainable model that was cash flow positive. We spent most of the next five years fighting with Blockbuster in the US. We began streaming in the US in 2007, and internationally in 2010. Our sobering Qwikster DVD misstep was in 2011. Our first original series debuted in 2013. We became global in 2016, nearly twenty years after starting Netflix. Over the following decades, internet TV will replace linear, and we hope to keep leading by offering an amazing entertainment experience.

Netflix is an American entertainment company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.[6] It specializes in and provides streaming media and video-on-demand online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into film and television production, as well as online distribution. As of 2017, the company has its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental by mail business.[6][7] In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010[8] and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.[9]
Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series, House of Cards. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "Netflix Original" content through its online library of films and television.[10] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
In July 2017, Netflix reported having 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the United States.[12]

Founding and establishment[edit]




Netflix's headquarters in Los Gatos, California


Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph[13][14] and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria Corporation. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.[15]
Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[16][7] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.[15] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.[15]
Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,[15] with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.[17][15]
Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start[edit]
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[18] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was declined.[19] Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[20]
Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.[21]
Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion[edit]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[22]
In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,[23] and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[24][25]
In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.[26][27] That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.[28] As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).[29] By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.[30] By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.[31]
Early Netflix Original content[edit]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[32] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[33][34]
Entertainment dominance and presence, and continued growth[edit]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[35] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[36]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[37] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[38][39][40] Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not.[41] However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.[42]
In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.[43] But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.[44][45] Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.[46] On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.[47] On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.[48]

In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[49] Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."[49] The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news.[50] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."[51][52]
In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies.[53] On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.[54] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.[55]
Rebranding and VPN blockage[edit]
In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.[56] In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.[57] In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.[58]
At the 2016 CES Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"[59] A notable absence was China which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.[59] By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.[60]
Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs.[61] At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.[62] By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.[63]
In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.[64] On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers.[65]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Netflix shares are mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.[66]
Services[edit]
Netflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles, and smart TVs[67] According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.[68]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[69] Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.[70]
Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.[71][72][73]
On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.[74][75][76]
History[edit]




Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix and the first CEO of the company.






Reed Hastings, co-founder and the current CEO.


On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[77]
In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[78]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[79] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.[80] Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[80] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:

"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."[79]

In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[81]
Disc rental[edit]
In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States[82] The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight[citation needed] DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-Ray disc for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.[83]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[84][85][86] In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
Qwikster[edit]
On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.[87][88][89][90]
On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.[89][90][91]
In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[92][93][94]
Profiles[edit]
In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.[95] Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.[96] However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,[97][98][99] Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.[100] In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."[101]
Reintroduction[edit]
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".[102] Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".[102] Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,[102][103] since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.[103] Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".[104]
Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.[105]
Critics of the feature have noted:

New profiles are created as "blank slates",[105] but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.[106]
People don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) – whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile[104][105][106]

In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.[105][106]
Products[edit]




An Aquos remote control with a Netflix button


In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[107]
Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.[108][109]
In May 2016, it created a new tool called FAST to determine how fast one's Internet connection is.[110]
Content[edit]
Netflix Originals[edit]
Further information: List of original programs distributed by Netflix
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[11]
In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and stars Kevin Spacey.[111] In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[112][113] Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.[114]
In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo FAST, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July.[115][116] Netflix has distributed over a dozen other animated family and kid shows, including All Hail King Julien, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Dawn of the Croods, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Kulipari: An Army of Frogs.











Logos of some Netflix original programs


Orange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013.[117] In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series.[118][119] In February 2016, Orange is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season.
In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live action series' Marvel superhero-focused: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015.[120][121][122] The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, with the miniseries of The Defenders and Iron Fist scheduled for a 2017 release. In April 2016 the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include an 13-episode series of The Punisher.[123][124] In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.[125]
In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.[126] The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.[127]
The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski[128] Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.
Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction supernatural drama Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama The Get Down in August, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house.[129]
In January 2017, Netflix announced all Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.[130] The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.[131]
In April 2017, Netflix confirmed it had reached a licensing deal for original Netflix content with iQiYi, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu.[132]
Canceled programs[edit]
As of 2017, Netflix has canceled eight shows.[133][134][135] They are:

Longmire - canceled after six seasons, three of which aired on Netflix
Lilyhammer - canceled after three seasons
Hemlock Grove - canceled after three seasons
Marco Polo - canceled after two seasons
The Get Down - canceled after one season
Sense8 - canceled after two seasons (renewed for final episode)
Richie Rich - canceled after two seasons
Girlboss - canceled after one season

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films catalogued in Netflix's United States library include recent releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures,[136] as well as DreamWorks Animation,[137] Open Road Films[138] (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights[139]), FilmDistrict,[140] The Weinstein Company,[141][142] Sony Pictures Animation,[143] and the Walt Disney Studios catalog among others.
Other distributors who have sold back-catalog rights to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Disney–ABC Television Group, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television, Hasbro Studios, Saban Brands and CBS Television Distribution. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Sony Pictures Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library.[144]
Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service.[145] These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[146][147]
On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service.[148] However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[149]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[150] Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal.[151] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[152][153]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[154] However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and many of the channel's shows were removed in March 2015.[155] Most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.[156]
In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox, distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.[157]
In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch."[158] He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that "[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".[159]

Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[179][180][181]
Sales and marketing[edit]
Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a Compete.com survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.[182]
During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.[183]
In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.[184]

Competitors[edit]
See also: Online DVD rental and Video on demand
Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu, in 2010.[197]
Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.[198] On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.[199] On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.[200] (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)[201]
In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,[202] which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.[203] In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).[204]
Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012.[205] In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service,[206] which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"[207] due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."[208]
CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".[209]
Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."[210]
Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering pornography, but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarDVD and WantedList.[211][212]
In Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services Stan and Quickflix.[213] In Scandinavia, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More.[214][215] In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ,[216] Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix.[217] In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix.[citation needed] In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision.[citation needed] In South Africa, Netflix competes with ShowMax.[218] In the Middle East, Netflix competes with Starz Play Arabia.
In Mexico, when Televisa tried to create its own streaming service called Blim, it was heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,[219][220] Netflix themselves also criticized the poor quality of the productions content made by Televisa.[221]
Time Warner[edit]
In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."[222] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."[223]
Awards[edit]
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by Netflix
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[224] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[224][225] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[226] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[227]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards.[228] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[229][230][231] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[232]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[233]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.[234] The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[234]
In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.
Finance and revenue[edit]
2010[edit]
In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.[235]
2011[edit]
In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.[236]
At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[237][238] However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.[239] By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.[240][241] Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.[242]
2014[edit]
In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.[243] The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to Forbes,[244] "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".[245]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.[246] Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;[247] this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).[248]
Legal issues and controversies[edit]
Main article: Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix
In 2004, Netflix was sued for false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery".[249]
Also, in 2015, Netflix was caught up in a copyright lawsuit of international scope involving the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.[250][251]
Netflix was also sued in 2016 because Netflix told subscribers in marketing material that they "would not increase monthly subscription prices as long as the subscribers maintained the subscription service continuously," However, Netflix announced that it would “phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest tenured members getting the longest benefit.” The according to the class action, "Netflix has broken its contract with these subscribers by unilaterally raising monthly subscription prices".[252]

Effects and legacy[edit]
The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just binge straight into the next episode.[253] Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.[254]
Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective.[255] Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.[256] Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.[257]
In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.[258]

Netflix is an American entertainment company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.[6] It specializes in and provides streaming media and video-on-demand online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into film and television production, as well as online distribution. As of 2017, the company has its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental by mail business.[6][7] In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010[8] and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.[9]
Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series, House of Cards. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "Netflix Original" content through its online library of films and television.[10] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
In July 2017, Netflix reported having 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the United States.[12]

Founding and establishment[edit]




Netflix's headquarters in Los Gatos, California


Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph[13][14] and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria Corporation. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.[15]
Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[16][7] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.[15] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.[15]
Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,[15] with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.[17][15]
Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start[edit]
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[18] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was declined.[19] Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[20]
Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.[21]
Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion[edit]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[22]
In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,[23] and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[24][25]
In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.[26][27] That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.[28] As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).[29] By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.[30] By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.[31]
Early Netflix Original content[edit]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[32] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[33][34]
Entertainment dominance and presence, and continued growth[edit]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[35] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[36]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[37] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[38][39][40] Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not.[41] However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.[42]
In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.[43] But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.[44][45] Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.[46] On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.[47] On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.[48]

In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[49] Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."[49] The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news.[50] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."[51][52]
In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies.[53] On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.[54] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.[55]
Rebranding and VPN blockage[edit]
In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.[56] In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.[57] In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.[58]
At the 2016 CES Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"[59] A notable absence was China which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.[59] By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.[60]
Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs.[61] At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.[62] By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.[63]
In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.[64] On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers.[65]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Netflix shares are mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.[66]
Services[edit]
Netflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles, and smart TVs[67] According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.[68]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[69] Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.[70]
Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.[71][72][73]
On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.[74][75][76]
History[edit]




Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix and the first CEO of the company.






Reed Hastings, co-founder and the current CEO.


On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[77]
In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[78]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[79] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.[80] Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[80] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:

"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."[79]

In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[81]
Disc rental[edit]
In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States[82] The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight[citation needed] DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-Ray disc for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.[83]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[84][85][86] In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
Qwikster[edit]
On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.[87][88][89][90]
On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.[89][90][91]
In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[92][93][94]
Profiles[edit]
In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.[95] Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.[96] However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,[97][98][99] Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.[100] In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."[101]
Reintroduction[edit]
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".[102] Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".[102] Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,[102][103] since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.[103] Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".[104]
Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.[105]
Critics of the feature have noted:

New profiles are created as "blank slates",[105] but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.[106]
People don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) – whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile[104][105][106]

In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.[105][106]
Products[edit]




An Aquos remote control with a Netflix button


In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[107]
Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.[108][109]
In May 2016, it created a new tool called FAST to determine how fast one's Internet connection is.[110]
Content[edit]
Netflix Originals[edit]
Further information: List of original programs distributed by Netflix
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[11]
In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and stars Kevin Spacey.[111] In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[112][113] Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.[114]
In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo FAST, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July.[115][116] Netflix has distributed over a dozen other animated family and kid shows, including All Hail King Julien, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Dawn of the Croods, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Kulipari: An Army of Frogs.











Logos of some Netflix original programs


Orange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013.[117] In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series.[118][119] In February 2016, Orange is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season.
In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live action series' Marvel superhero-focused: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015.[120][121][122] The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, with the miniseries of The Defenders and Iron Fist scheduled for a 2017 release. In April 2016 the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include an 13-episode series of The Punisher.[123][124] In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.[125]
In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.[126] The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.[127]
The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski[128] Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.
Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction supernatural drama Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama The Get Down in August, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house.[129]
In January 2017, Netflix announced all Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.[130] The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.[131]
In April 2017, Netflix confirmed it had reached a licensing deal for original Netflix content with iQiYi, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu.[132]
Canceled programs[edit]
As of 2017, Netflix has canceled eight shows.[133][134][135] They are:

Longmire - canceled after six seasons, three of which aired on Netflix
Lilyhammer - canceled after three seasons
Hemlock Grove - canceled after three seasons
Marco Polo - canceled after two seasons
The Get Down - canceled after one season
Sense8 - canceled after two seasons (renewed for final episode)
Richie Rich - canceled after two seasons
Girlboss - canceled after one season

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films catalogued in Netflix's United States library include recent releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures,[136] as well as DreamWorks Animation,[137] Open Road Films[138] (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights[139]), FilmDistrict,[140] The Weinstein Company,[141][142] Sony Pictures Animation,[143] and the Walt Disney Studios catalog among others.
Other distributors who have sold back-catalog rights to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Disney–ABC Television Group, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television, Hasbro Studios, Saban Brands and CBS Television Distribution. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Sony Pictures Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library.[144]
Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service.[145] These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[146][147]
On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service.[148] However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[149]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[150] Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal.[151] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[152][153]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[154] However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and many of the channel's shows were removed in March 2015.[155] Most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.[156]
In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox, distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.[157]
In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch."[158] He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that "[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".[159]

4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting HDCP 2.2. Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[179][180][181]
Sales and marketing[edit]
Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a Compete.com survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.[182]
During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.[183]
In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.[184]

Competitors[edit]
See also: Online DVD rental and Video on demand
Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu, in 2010.[197]
Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.[198] On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.[199] On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.[200] (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)[201]
In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,[202] which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.[203] In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).[204]
Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012.[205] In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service,[206] which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"[207] due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."[208]
CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".[209]
Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."[210]
Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering pornography, but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarDVD and WantedList.[211][212]
In Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services Stan and Quickflix.[213] In Scandinavia, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More.[214][215] In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ,[216] Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix.[217] In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix.[citation needed] In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision.[citation needed] In South Africa, Netflix competes with ShowMax.[218] In the Middle East, Netflix competes with Starz Play Arabia.
In Mexico, when Televisa tried to create its own streaming service called Blim, it was heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,[219][220] Netflix themselves also criticized the poor quality of the productions content made by Televisa.[221]
Time Warner[edit]
In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."[222] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."[223]
Awards[edit]
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by Netflix
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[224] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[224][225] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[226] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[227]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards.[228] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[229][230][231] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[232]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[233]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.[234] The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[234]
In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.
Finance and revenue[edit]
2010[edit]
In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.[235]
2011[edit]
In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.[236]
At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[237][238] However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.[239] By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.[240][241] Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.[242]
2014[edit]
In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.[243] The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to Forbes,[244] "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".[245]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.[246] Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;[247] this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).[248]
Legal issues and controversies[edit]
Main article: Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix
In 2004, Netflix was sued for false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery".[249]
Also, in 2015, Netflix was caught up in a copyright lawsuit of international scope involving the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.[250][251]
Netflix was also sued in 2016 because Netflix told subscribers in marketing material that they "would not increase monthly subscription prices as long as the subscribers maintained the subscription service continuously," However, Netflix announced that it would “phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest tenured members getting the longest benefit.” The according to the class action, "Netflix has broken its contract with these subscribers by unilaterally raising monthly subscription prices".[252]

Effects and legacy[edit]
The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just binge straight into the next episode.[253] Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.[254]
Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective.[255] Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.[256] Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.[257]
In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.[258]

Netflix is an American entertainment company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.[6] It specializes in and provides streaming media and video-on-demand online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into film and television production, as well as online distribution. As of 2017, the company has its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental by mail business.[6][7] In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010[8] and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.[9]
Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series, House of Cards. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "Netflix Original" content through its online library of films and television.[10] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
In July 2017, Netflix reported having 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the United States.[12]

Founding and establishment[edit]




Netflix's headquarters in Los Gatos, California


Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph[13][14] and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria Corporation. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.[15]
Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[16][7] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.[15] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.[15]
Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,[15] with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.[17][15]
Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start[edit]
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[18] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was declined.[19] Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[20]
Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.[21]
Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion[edit]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[22]
In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,[23] and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[24][25]
In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.[26][27] That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.[28] As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).[29] By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.[30] By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.[31]
Early Netflix Original content[edit]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[32] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[33][34]
Entertainment dominance and presence, and continued growth[edit]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[35] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[36]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[37] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[38][39][40] Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not.[41] However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.[42]
In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.[43] But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.[44][45] Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.[46] On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.[47] On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.[48]

In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[49] Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."[49] The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news.[50] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."[51][52]
In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies.[53] On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.[54] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.[55]
Rebranding and VPN blockage[edit]
In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.[56] In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.[57] In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.[58]
At the 2016 CES Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"[59] A notable absence was China which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.[59] By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.[60]
Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs.[61] At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.[62] By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.[63]
In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.[64] On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers.[65]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Netflix shares are mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.[66]
Services[edit]
Netflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles, and smart TVs[67] According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.[68]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[69] Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.[70]
Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.[71][72][73]
On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.[74][75][76]
History[edit]

On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[77]
In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[78]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[79] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.[80] Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[80] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:

"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."[79]

In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[81]
Disc rental[edit]
In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States[82] The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight[citation needed] DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-Ray disc for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.[83]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[84][85][86] In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
Qwikster[edit]
On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.[87][88][89][90]
On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.[89][90][91]
In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[92][93][94]
Profiles[edit]
In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.[95] Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.[96] However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,[97][98][99] Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.[100] In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."[101]
Reintroduction[edit]
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".[102] Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".[102] Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,[102][103] since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.[103] Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".[104]
Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.[105]
Critics of the feature have noted:

New profiles are created as "blank slates",[105] but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.[106]
People don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) – whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile[104][105][106]

In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.[105][106]
Products[edit]




An Aquos remote control with a Netflix button


In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[107]
Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.[108][109]
In May 2016, it created a new tool called FAST to determine how fast one's Internet connection is.[110]
Content[edit]
Netflix Originals[edit]
Further information: List of original programs distributed by Netflix
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[11]
In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and stars Kevin Spacey.[111] In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[112][113] Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.[114]
In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo FAST, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July.[115][116] Netflix has distributed over a dozen other animated family and kid shows, including All Hail King Julien, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Dawn of the Croods, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Kulipari: An Army of Frogs.











Logos of some Netflix original programs


Orange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013.[117] In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series.[118][119] In February 2016, Orange is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season.
In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live action series' Marvel superhero-focused: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015.[120][121][122] The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, with the miniseries of The Defenders and Iron Fist scheduled for a 2017 release. In April 2016 the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include an 13-episode series of The Punisher.[123][124] In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.[125]
In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.[126] The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.[127]
The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski[128] Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.
Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction supernatural drama Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama The Get Down in August, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house.[129]
In January 2017, Netflix announced all Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.[130] The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.[131]
In April 2017, Netflix confirmed it had reached a licensing deal for original Netflix content with iQiYi, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu.[132]
Canceled programs[edit]
As of 2017, Netflix has canceled eight shows.[133][134][135] They are:

Longmire - canceled after six seasons, three of which aired on Netflix
Lilyhammer - canceled after three seasons
Hemlock Grove - canceled after three seasons
Marco Polo - canceled after two seasons
The Get Down - canceled after one season
Sense8 - canceled after two seasons (renewed for final episode)
Richie Rich - canceled after two seasons
Girlboss - canceled after one season

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films catalogued in Netflix's United States library include recent releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures,[136] as well as DreamWorks Animation,[137] Open Road Films[138] (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights[139]), FilmDistrict,[140] The Weinstein Company,[141][142] Sony Pictures Animation,[143] and the Walt Disney Studios catalog among others.
Other distributors who have sold back-catalog rights to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Disney–ABC Television Group, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television, Hasbro Studios, Saban Brands and CBS Television Distribution. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Sony Pictures Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library.[144]
Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service.[145] These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[146][147]
On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service.[148] However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[149]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[150] Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal.[151] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[152][153]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[154] However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and many of the channel's shows were removed in March 2015.[155] Most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.[156]
In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox, distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.[157]
In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch."[158] He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that "[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".[159]

4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting HDCP 2.2. Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[179][180][181]
Sales and marketing[edit]
Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a Compete.com survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.[182]
During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.[183]
In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.[184]

Competitors[edit]
See also: Online DVD rental and Video on demand
Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu, in 2010.[197]
Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.[198] On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.[199] On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.[200] (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)[201]
In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,[202] which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.[203] In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).[204]
Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012.[205] In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service,[206] which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"[207] due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."[208]
CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".[209]
Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."[210]
Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering pornography, but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarDVD and WantedList.[211][212]
In Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services Stan and Quickflix.[213] In Scandinavia, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More.[214][215] In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ,[216] Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix.[217] In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix.[citation needed] In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision.[citation needed] In South Africa, Netflix competes with ShowMax.[218] In the Middle East, Netflix competes with Starz Play Arabia.
In Mexico, when Televisa tried to create its own streaming service called Blim, it was heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,[219][220] Netflix themselves also criticized the poor quality of the productions content made by Televisa.[221]
Time Warner[edit]
In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."[222] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."[223]
Awards[edit]
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by Netflix
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[224] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[224][225] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[226] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[227]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards.[228] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[229][230][231] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[232]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[233]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.[234] The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[234]
In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.

In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.[235]
2011[edit]
In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.[236]
At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[237][238] However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.[239] By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.[240][241] Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.[242]
2014[edit]
In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.[243] The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to Forbes,[244] "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".[245]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.[246] Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;[247] this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).[248]
Legal issues and controversies[edit]
Main article: Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix
In 2004, Netflix was sued for false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery".[249]
Also, in 2015, Netflix was caught up in a copyright lawsuit of international scope involving the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.[250][251]
Netflix was also sued in 2016 because Netflix told subscribers in marketing material that they "would not increase monthly subscription prices as long as the subscribers maintained the subscription service continuously," However, Netflix announced that it would “phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest tenured members getting the longest benefit.” The according to the class action, "Netflix has broken its contract with these subscribers by unilaterally raising monthly subscription prices".[252]

Effects and legacy[edit]
The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just binge straight into the next episode.[253] Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.[254]
Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective.[255] Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.[256] Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.[257]
In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.[258]

Netflix is an American entertainment company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.[6] It specializes in and provides streaming media and video-on-demand online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into film and television production, as well as online distribution. As of 2017, the company has its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental by mail business.[6][7] In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010[8] and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.[9]
Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series, House of Cards. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "Netflix Original" content through its online library of films and television.[10] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
In July 2017, Netflix reported having 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the United States.[12]

Founding and establishment[edit]




Netflix's headquarters in Los Gatos, California


Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph[13][14] and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria Corporation. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.[15]
Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[16][7] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.[15] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.[15]
Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,[15] with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.[17][15]
Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start[edit]
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[18] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was declined.[19] Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[20]
Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.[21]
Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion[edit]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[22]
In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,[23] and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[24][25]
In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.[26][27] That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.[28] As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).[29] By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.[30] By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.[31]
Early Netflix Original content[edit]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[32] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[33][34]
Entertainment dominance and presence, and continued growth[edit]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[35] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[36]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[37] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[38][39][40] Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not.[41] However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.[42]
In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.[43] But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.[44][45] Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.[46] On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.[47] On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.[48]

In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[49] Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."[49] The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news.[50] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."[51][52]
In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies.[53] On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.[54] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.[55]
Rebranding and VPN blockage[edit]
In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.[56] In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.[57] In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.[58]
At the 2016 CES Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"[59] A notable absence was China which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.[59] By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.[60]
Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs.[61] At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.[62] By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.[63]
In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.[64] On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers.[65]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Netflix shares are mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.[66]
Services[edit]
Netflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles, and smart TVs[67] According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.[68]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[69] Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.[70]
Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.[71][72][73]
On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.[74][75][76]
History[edit]

On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[77]
In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[78]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[79] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.[80] Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[80] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:

"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."[79]

In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[81]
Disc rental[edit]
In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States[82] The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight[citation needed] DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-Ray disc for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.[83]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[84][85][86] In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
Qwikster[edit]
On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.[87][88][89][90]
On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.[89][90][91]
In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[92][93][94]
Profiles[edit]
In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.[95] Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.[96] However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,[97][98][99] Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.[100] In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."[101]
Reintroduction[edit]
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".[102] Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".[102] Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,[102][103] since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.[103] Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".[104]
Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.[105]
Critics of the feature have noted:

New profiles are created as "blank slates",[105] but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.[106]
People don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) – whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile[104][105][106]

In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.[105][106]
Products[edit]




An Aquos remote control with a Netflix button


In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[107]
Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.[108][109]
In May 2016, it created a new tool called FAST to determine how fast one's Internet connection is.[110]
Content[edit]
Netflix Originals[edit]
Further information: List of original programs distributed by Netflix
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[11]
In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and stars Kevin Spacey.[111] In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[112][113] Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.[114]
In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo FAST, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July.[115][116] Netflix has distributed over a dozen other animated family and kid shows, including All Hail King Julien, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Dawn of the Croods, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Kulipari: An Army of Frogs.











Logos of some Netflix original programs


Orange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013.[117] In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series.[118][119] In February 2016, Orange is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season.
In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live action series' Marvel superhero-focused: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015.[120][121][122] The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, with the miniseries of The Defenders and Iron Fist scheduled for a 2017 release. In April 2016 the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include an 13-episode series of The Punisher.[123][124] In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.[125]
In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.[126] The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.[127]
The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski[128] Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.
Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction supernatural drama Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama The Get Down in August, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house.[129]
In January 2017, Netflix announced all Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.[130] The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.[131]
In April 2017, Netflix confirmed it had reached a licensing deal for original Netflix content with iQiYi, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu.[132]
Canceled programs[edit]
As of 2017, Netflix has canceled eight shows.[133][134][135] They are:

Longmire - canceled after six seasons, three of which aired on Netflix
Lilyhammer - canceled after three seasons
Hemlock Grove - canceled after three seasons
Marco Polo - canceled after two seasons
The Get Down - canceled after one season
Sense8 - canceled after two seasons (renewed for final episode)
Richie Rich - canceled after two seasons
Girlboss - canceled after one season

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films catalogued in Netflix's United States library include recent releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures,[136] as well as DreamWorks Animation,[137] Open Road Films[138] (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights[139]), FilmDistrict,[140] The Weinstein Company,[141][142] Sony Pictures Animation,[143] and the Walt Disney Studios catalog among others.
Other distributors who have sold back-catalog rights to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Disney–ABC Television Group, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television, Hasbro Studios, Saban Brands and CBS Television Distribution. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Sony Pictures Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library.[144]
Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service.[145] These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[146][147]
On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service.[148] However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[149]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[150] Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal.[151] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[152][153]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[154] However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and many of the channel's shows were removed in March 2015.[155] Most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.[156]
In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox, distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.[157]
In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch."[158] He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that "[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".[159]

4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting HDCP 2.2. Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[179][180][181]
Sales and marketing[edit]
Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a Compete.com survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.[182]
During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.[183]
In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.[184]

Competitors[edit]
See also: Online DVD rental and Video on demand
Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu, in 2010.[197]
Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.[198] On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.[199] On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.[200] (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)[201]
In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,[202] which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.[203] In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).[204]
Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012.[205] In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service,[206] which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"[207] due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."[208]
CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".[209]
Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."[210]
Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering pornography, but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarDVD and WantedList.[211][212]
In Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services Stan and Quickflix.[213] In Scandinavia, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More.[214][215] In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ,[216] Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix.[217] In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix.[citation needed] In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision.[citation needed] In South Africa, Netflix competes with ShowMax.[218] In the Middle East, Netflix competes with Starz Play Arabia.
In Mexico, when Televisa tried to create its own streaming service called Blim, it was heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,[219][220] Netflix themselves also criticized the poor quality of the productions content made by Televisa.[221]
Time Warner[edit]
In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."[222] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."[223]
Awards[edit]
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by Netflix
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[224] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[224][225] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[226] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[227]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards.[228] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[229][230][231] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[232]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[233]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.[234] The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[234]
In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.
Finance and revenue[edit]
2010[edit]
In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.[235]
2011[edit]
In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.[236]
At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[237][238] However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.[239] By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.[240][241] Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.[242]
2014[edit]
In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.[243] The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to Forbes,[244] "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".[245]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.[246] Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;[247] this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).[248]
Legal issues and controversies[edit]
Main article: Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix
In 2004, Netflix was sued for false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery".[249]
Also, in 2015, Netflix was caught up in a copyright lawsuit of international scope involving the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.[250][251]
Netflix was also sued in 2016 because Netflix told subscribers in marketing material that they "would not increase monthly subscription prices as long as the subscribers maintained the subscription service continuously," However, Netflix announced that it would “phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest tenured members getting the longest benefit.” The according to the class action, "Netflix has broken its contract with these subscribers by unilaterally raising monthly subscription prices".[252]

Effects and legacy[edit]
The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just binge straight into the next episode.[253] Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.[254]
Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective.[255] Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.[256] Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.[257]
In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.[258]

Netflix is an American entertainment company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.[6] It specializes in and provides streaming media and video-on-demand online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into film and television production, as well as online distribution. As of 2017, the company has its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental by mail business.[6][7] In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010[8] and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.[9]
Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series, House of Cards. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "Netflix Original" content through its online library of films and television.[10] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
In July 2017, Netflix reported having 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the United States.[12]

Founding and establishment[edit]




Netflix's headquarters in Los Gatos, California


Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph[13][14] and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria Corporation. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.[15]
Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[16][7] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.[15] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.[15]
Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,[15] with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.[17][15]
Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start[edit]
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[18] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was declined.[19] Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[20]
Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.[21]
Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion[edit]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[22]
In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,[23] and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[24][25]
In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.[26][27] That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.[28] As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).[29] By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.[30] By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.[31]
Early Netflix Original content[edit]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[32] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[33][34]
Entertainment dominance and presence, and continued growth[edit]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[35] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[36]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[37] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[38][39][40] Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not.[41] However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.[42]
In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.[43] But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.[44][45] Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.[46] On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.[47] On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.[48]

In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[49] Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."[49] The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news.[50] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."[51][52]
In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies.[53] On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.[54] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.[55]
Rebranding and VPN blockage[edit]
In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.[56] In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.[57] In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.[58]
At the 2016 CES Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"[59] A notable absence was China which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.[59] By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.[60]
Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs.[61] At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.[62] By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.[63]
In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.[64] On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers.[65]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Netflix shares are mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.[66]
Services[edit]
Netflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles, and smart TVs[67] According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.[68]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[69] Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.[70]
Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.[71][72][73]
On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.[74][75][76]
History[edit]

On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[77]
In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[78]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[79] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.[80] Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[80] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:

"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."[79]

In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[81]
Disc rental[edit]
In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States[82] The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight[citation needed] DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-Ray disc for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.[83]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[84][85][86] In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
Qwikster[edit]
On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.[87][88][89][90]
On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.[89][90][91]
In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[92][93][94]
Profiles[edit]
In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.[95] Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.[96] However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,[97][98][99] Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.[100] In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."[101]
Reintroduction[edit]
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".[102] Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".[102] Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,[102][103] since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.[103] Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".[104]
Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.[105]
Critics of the feature have noted:

New profiles are created as "blank slates",[105] but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.[106]
People don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) – whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile[104][105][106]

In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.[105][106]
Products[edit]




An Aquos remote control with a Netflix button


In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[107]
Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.[108][109]
In May 2016, it created a new tool called FAST to determine how fast one's Internet connection is.[110]
Content[edit]
Netflix Originals[edit]
Further information: List of original programs distributed by Netflix
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[11]
In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and stars Kevin Spacey.[111] In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[112][113] Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.[114]
In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo FAST, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July.[115][116] Netflix has distributed over a dozen other animated family and kid shows, including All Hail King Julien, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Dawn of the Croods, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Kulipari: An Army of Frogs.











Logos of some Netflix original programs


Orange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013.[117] In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series.[118][119] In February 2016, Orange is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season.
In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live action series' Marvel superhero-focused: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015.[120][121][122] The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, with the miniseries of The Defenders and Iron Fist scheduled for a 2017 release. In April 2016 the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include an 13-episode series of The Punisher.[123][124] In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.[125]
In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.[126] The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.[127]
The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski[128] Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.
Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction supernatural drama Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama The Get Down in August, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house.[129]
In January 2017, Netflix announced all Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.[130] The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.[131]
In April 2017, Netflix confirmed it had reached a licensing deal for original Netflix content with iQiYi, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu.[132]
Canceled programs[edit]
As of 2017, Netflix has canceled eight shows.[133][134][135] They are:

Longmire - canceled after six seasons, three of which aired on Netflix
Lilyhammer - canceled after three seasons
Hemlock Grove - canceled after three seasons
Marco Polo - canceled after two seasons
The Get Down - canceled after one season
Sense8 - canceled after two seasons (renewed for final episode)
Richie Rich - canceled after two seasons
Girlboss - canceled after one season

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films catalogued in Netflix's United States library include recent releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures,[136] as well as DreamWorks Animation,[137] Open Road Films[138] (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights[139]), FilmDistrict,[140] The Weinstein Company,[141][142] Sony Pictures Animation,[143] and the Walt Disney Studios catalog among others.
Other distributors who have sold back-catalog rights to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Disney–ABC Television Group, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television, Hasbro Studios, Saban Brands and CBS Television Distribution. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Sony Pictures Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library.[144]
Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service.[145] These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[146][147]
On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service.[148] However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[149]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[150] Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal.[151] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[152][153]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[154] However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and many of the channel's shows were removed in March 2015.[155] Most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.[156]
In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox, distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.[157]
In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch."[158] He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that "[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".[159]

4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting HDCP 2.2. Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[179][180][181]
Sales and marketing[edit]
Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a Compete.com survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.[182]
During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.[183]
In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.[184]

Competitors[edit]
See also: Online DVD rental and Video on demand
Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu, in 2010.[197]
Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.[198] On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.[199] On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.[200] (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)[201]
In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,[202] which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.[203] In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).[204]
Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012.[205] In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service,[206] which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"[207] due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."[208]
CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".[209]
Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."[210]
Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering pornography, but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarDVD and WantedList.[211][212]
In Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services Stan and Quickflix.[213] In Scandinavia, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More.[214][215] In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ,[216] Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix.[217] In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix.[citation needed] In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision.[citation needed] In South Africa, Netflix competes with ShowMax.[218] In the Middle East, Netflix competes with Starz Play Arabia.
In Mexico, when Televisa tried to create its own streaming service called Blim, it was heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,[219][220] Netflix themselves also criticized the poor quality of the productions content made by Televisa.[221]
Time Warner[edit]
In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."[222] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."[223]
Awards[edit]
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by Netflix
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[224] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[224][225] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[226] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[227]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards.[228] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[229][230][231] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[232]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[233]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.[234] The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[234]
In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.
Finance and revenue[edit]
2010[edit]
In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.[235]
2011[edit]
In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.[236]
At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[237][238] However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.[239] By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.[240][241] Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.[242]
2014[edit]
In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.[243] The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to Forbes,[244] "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".[245]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.[246] Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;[247] this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).[248]
Legal issues and controversies[edit]
Main article: Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix
In 2004, Netflix was sued for false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery".[249]
Also, in 2015, Netflix was caught up in a copyright lawsuit of international scope involving the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.[250][251]
Netflix was also sued in 2016 because Netflix told subscribers in marketing material that they "would not increase monthly subscription prices as long as the subscribers maintained the subscription service continuously," However, Netflix announced that it would “phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest tenured members getting the longest benefit.” The according to the class action, "Netflix has broken its contract with these subscribers by unilaterally raising monthly subscription prices".[252]

Effects and legacy[edit]
The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just binge straight into the next episode.[253] Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.[254]
Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective.[255] Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.[256] Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.[257]
In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.[258]

Netflix is an American entertainment company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.[6] It specializes in and provides streaming media and video-on-demand online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into film and television production, as well as online distribution. As of 2017, the company has its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental by mail business.[6][7] In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010[8] and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.[9]
Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series, House of Cards. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "Netflix Original" content through its online library of films and television.[10] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
In July 2017, Netflix reported having 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the United States.[12]

Founding and establishment[edit]




Netflix's headquarters in Los Gatos, California


Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph[13][14] and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria Corporation. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.[15]
Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[16][7] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.[15] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.[15]
Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,[15] with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.[17][15]
Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start[edit]
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[18] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was declined.[19] Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[20]
Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.[21]
Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion[edit]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[22]
In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,[23] and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[24][25]
In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.[26][27] That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.[28] As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).[29] By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.[30] By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.[31]
Early Netflix Original content[edit]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[32] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[33][34]
Entertainment dominance and presence, and continued growth[edit]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[35] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[36]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[37] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[38][39][40] Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not.[41] However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.[42]
In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.[43] But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.[44][45] Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.[46] On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.[47] On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.[48]

In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[49] Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."[49] The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news.[50] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."[51][52]
In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies.[53] On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.[54] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.[55]
Rebranding and VPN blockage[edit]
In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.[56] In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.[57] In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.[58]
At the 2016 CES Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"[59] A notable absence was China which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.[59] By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.[60]
Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs.[61] At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.[62] By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.[63]
In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.[64] On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers.[65]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Netflix shares are mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.[66]
Services[edit]
Netflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles, and smart TVs[67] According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.[68]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[69] Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.[70]
Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.[71][72][73]
On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.[74][75][76]
History[edit]

On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[77]
In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[78]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[79] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.[80] Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[80] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:

"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."[79]

In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[81]
Disc rental[edit]
In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States[82] The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight[citation needed] DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-Ray disc for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.[83]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[84][85][86] In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
Qwikster[edit]
On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.[87][88][89][90]
On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.[89][90][91]
In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[92][93][94]
Profiles[edit]
In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.[95] Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.[96] However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,[97][98][99] Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.[100] In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."[101]
Reintroduction[edit]
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".[102] Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".[102] Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,[102][103] since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.[103] Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".[104]
Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.[105]
Critics of the feature have noted:

New profiles are created as "blank slates",[105] but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.[106]
People don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) – whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile[104][105][106]

In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.[105][106]
Products[edit]




An Aquos remote control with a Netflix button


In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[107]
Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.[108][109]
In May 2016, it created a new tool called FAST to determine how fast one's Internet connection is.[110]
Content[edit]
Netflix Originals[edit]
Further information: List of original programs distributed by Netflix
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[11]
In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and stars Kevin Spacey.[111] In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[112][113] Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.[114]
In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo FAST, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July.[115][116] Netflix has distributed over a dozen other animated family and kid shows, including All Hail King Julien, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Dawn of the Croods, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Kulipari: An Army of Frogs.











Logos of some Netflix original programs


Orange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013.[117] In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series.[118][119] In February 2016, Orange is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season.
In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live action series' Marvel superhero-focused: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015.[120][121][122] The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, with the miniseries of The Defenders and Iron Fist scheduled for a 2017 release. In April 2016 the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include an 13-episode series of The Punisher.[123][124] In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.[125]
In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.[126] The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.[127]
The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski[128] Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.
Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction supernatural drama Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama The Get Down in August, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house.[129]
In January 2017, Netflix announced all Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.[130] The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.[131]
In April 2017, Netflix confirmed it had reached a licensing deal for original Netflix content with iQiYi, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu.[132]
Canceled programs[edit]
As of 2017, Netflix has canceled eight shows.[133][134][135] They are:

Longmire - canceled after six seasons, three of which aired on Netflix
Lilyhammer - canceled after three seasons
Hemlock Grove - canceled after three seasons
Marco Polo - canceled after two seasons
The Get Down - canceled after one season
Sense8 - canceled after two seasons (renewed for final episode)
Richie Rich - canceled after two seasons
Girlboss - canceled after one season

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films catalogued in Netflix's United States library include recent releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures,[136] as well as DreamWorks Animation,[137] Open Road Films[138] (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights[139]), FilmDistrict,[140] The Weinstein Company,[141][142] Sony Pictures Animation,[143] and the Walt Disney Studios catalog among others.
Other distributors who have sold back-catalog rights to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Disney–ABC Television Group, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television, Hasbro Studios, Saban Brands and CBS Television Distribution. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Sony Pictures Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library.[144]
Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service.[145] These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[146][147]
On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service.[148] However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[149]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[150] Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal.[151] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[152][153]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[154] However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and many of the channel's shows were removed in March 2015.[155] Most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.[156]
In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox, distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.[157]
In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch."[158] He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that "[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".[159]

4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting HDCP 2.2. Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[179][180][181]
Sales and marketing[edit]
Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a Compete.com survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.[182]
During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.[183]
In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.[184]

Competitors[edit]
See also: Online DVD rental and Video on demand
Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu, in 2010.[197]
Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.[198] On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.[199] On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.[200] (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)[201]
In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,[202] which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.[203] In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).[204]
Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012.[205] In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service,[206] which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"[207] due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."[208]
CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".[209]
Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."[210]
Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering pornography, but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarDVD and WantedList.[211][212]
In Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services Stan and Quickflix.[213] In Scandinavia, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More.[214][215] In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ,[216] Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix.[217] In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix.[citation needed] In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision.[citation needed] In South Africa, Netflix competes with ShowMax.[218] In the Middle East, Netflix competes with Starz Play Arabia.
In Mexico, when Televisa tried to create its own streaming service called Blim, it was heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,[219][220] Netflix themselves also criticized the poor quality of the productions content made by Televisa.[221]
Time Warner[edit]
In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."[222] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."[223]
Awards[edit]
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by Netflix
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[224] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[224][225] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[226] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[227]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards.[228] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[229][230][231] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[232]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[233]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.[234] The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[234]
In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.
Finance and revenue[edit]
2010[edit]
In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.[235]
2011[edit]
In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.[236]
At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[237][238] However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.[239] By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.[240][241] Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.[242]
2014[edit]
In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.[243] The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to Forbes,[244] "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".[245]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.[246] Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;[247] this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).[248]
Legal issues and controversies[edit]
Main article: Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix
In 2004, Netflix was sued for false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery".[249]
Also, in 2015, Netflix was caught up in a copyright lawsuit of international scope involving the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.[250][251]
Netflix was also sued in 2016 because Netflix told subscribers in marketing material that they "would not increase monthly subscription prices as long as the subscribers maintained the subscription service continuously," However, Netflix announced that it would “phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest tenured members getting the longest benefit.” The according to the class action, "Netflix has broken its contract with these subscribers by unilaterally raising monthly subscription prices".[252]

Effects and legacy[edit]
The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just binge straight into the next episode.[253] Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.[254]
Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective.[255] Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.[256] Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.[257]
In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.[258]

Netflix is an American entertainment company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.[6] It specializes in and provides streaming media and video-on-demand online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into film and television production, as well as online distribution. As of 2017, the company has its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental by mail business.[6][7] In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010[8] and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.[9]
Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series, House of Cards. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "Netflix Original" content through its online library of films and television.[10] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
In July 2017, Netflix reported having 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the United States.[12]

Founding and establishment[edit]




Netflix's headquarters in Los Gatos, California


Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph[13][14] and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria Corporation. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.[15]
Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[16][7] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.[15] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.[15]
Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,[15] with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.[17][15]
Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start[edit]
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[18] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was declined.[19] Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[20]
Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.[21]
Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion[edit]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[22]
In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,[23] and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[24][25]
In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.[26][27] That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.[28] As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).[29] By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.[30] By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.[31]
Early Netflix Original content[edit]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[32] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[33][34]
Entertainment dominance and presence, and continued growth[edit]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[35] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[36]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[37] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[38][39][40] Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not.[41] However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.[42]
In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.[43] But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.[44][45] Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.[46] On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.[47] On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.[48]

In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[49] Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."[49] The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news.[50] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."[51][52]
In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies.[53] On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.[54] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.[55]
Rebranding and VPN blockage[edit]
In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.[56] In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.[57] In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.[58]
At the 2016 CES Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"[59] A notable absence was China which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.[59] By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.[60]
Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs.[61] At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.[62] By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.[63]
In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.[64] On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers.[65]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Netflix shares are mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.[66]
Services[edit]
Netflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles, and smart TVs[67] According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.[68]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[69] Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.[70]
Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.[71][72][73]
On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.[74][75][76]
History[edit]




Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix and the first CEO of the company.






Reed Hastings, co-founder and the current CEO.


On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[77]
In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[78]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[79] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.[80] Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[80] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:

"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."[79]

In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[81]
Disc rental[edit]
In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States[82] The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight[citation needed] DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-Ray disc for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.[83]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[84][85][86] In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
Qwikster[edit]
On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.[87][88][89][90]
On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.[89][90][91]
In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[92][93][94]
Profiles[edit]
In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.[95] Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.[96] However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,[97][98][99] Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.[100] In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."[101]
Reintroduction[edit]
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".[102] Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".[102] Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,[102][103] since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.[103] Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".[104]
Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.[105]
Critics of the feature have noted:

New profiles are created as "blank slates",[105] but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.[106]
People don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) – whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile[104][105][106]

In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.[105][106]
Products[edit]




An Aquos remote control with a Netflix button


In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[107]
Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.[108][109]
In May 2016, it created a new tool called FAST to determine how fast one's Internet connection is.[110]
Content[edit]
Netflix Originals[edit]
Further information: List of original programs distributed by Netflix
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[11]
In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and stars Kevin Spacey.[111] In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[112][113] Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.[114]
In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo FAST, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July.[115][116] Netflix has distributed over a dozen other animated family and kid shows, including All Hail King Julien, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Dawn of the Croods, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Kulipari: An Army of Frogs.











Logos of some Netflix original programs


Orange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013.[117] In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series.[118][119] In February 2016, Orange is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season.
In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live action series' Marvel superhero-focused: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015.[120][121][122] The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, with the miniseries of The Defenders and Iron Fist scheduled for a 2017 release. In April 2016 the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include an 13-episode series of The Punisher.[123][124] In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.[125]
In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.[126] The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.[127]
The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski[128] Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.
Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction supernatural drama Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama The Get Down in August, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house.[129]
In January 2017, Netflix announced all Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.[130] The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.[131]
In April 2017, Netflix confirmed it had reached a licensing deal for original Netflix content with iQiYi, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu.[132]
Canceled programs[edit]
As of 2017, Netflix has canceled eight shows.[133][134][135] They are:

Longmire - canceled after six seasons, three of which aired on Netflix
Lilyhammer - canceled after three seasons
Hemlock Grove - canceled after three seasons
Marco Polo - canceled after two seasons
The Get Down - canceled after one season
Sense8 - canceled after two seasons (renewed for final episode)
Richie Rich - canceled after two seasons
Girlboss - canceled after one season

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films catalogued in Netflix's United States library include recent releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures,[136] as well as DreamWorks Animation,[137] Open Road Films[138] (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights[139]), FilmDistrict,[140] The Weinstein Company,[141][142] Sony Pictures Animation,[143] and the Walt Disney Studios catalog among others.
Other distributors who have sold back-catalog rights to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Disney–ABC Television Group, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television, Hasbro Studios, Saban Brands and CBS Television Distribution. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Sony Pictures Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library.[144]
Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service.[145] These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[146][147]
On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service.[148] However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[149]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[150] Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal.[151] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[152][153]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[154] However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and many of the channel's shows were removed in March 2015.[155] Most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.[156]
In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox, distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.[157]
In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch."[158] He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that "[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".[159]

Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[179][180][181]
Sales and marketing[edit]
Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a Compete.com survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.[182]
During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.[183]
In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.[184]

Competitors[edit]
See also: Online DVD rental and Video on demand
Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu, in 2010.[197]
Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.[198] On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.[199] On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.[200] (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)[201]
In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,[202] which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.[203] In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).[204]
Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012.[205] In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service,[206] which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"[207] due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."[208]
CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".[209]
Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."[210]
Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering pornography, but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarDVD and WantedList.[211][212]
In Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services Stan and Quickflix.[213] In Scandinavia, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More.[214][215] In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ,[216] Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix.[217] In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix.[citation needed] In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision.[citation needed] In South Africa, Netflix competes with ShowMax.[218] In the Middle East, Netflix competes with Starz Play Arabia.
In Mexico, when Televisa tried to create its own streaming service called Blim, it was heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,[219][220] Netflix themselves also criticized the poor quality of the productions content made by Televisa.[221]
Time Warner[edit]
In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."[222] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."[223]
Awards[edit]
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by Netflix
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[224] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[224][225] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[226] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[227]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards.[228] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[229][230][231] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[232]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[233]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.[234] The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[234]
In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.
Finance and revenue[edit]
2010[edit]
In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.[235]
2011[edit]
In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.[236]
At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[237][238] However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.[239] By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.[240][241] Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.[242]
2014[edit]
In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.[243] The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to Forbes,[244] "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".[245]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.[246] Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;[247] this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).[248]
Legal issues and controversies[edit]
Main article: Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix
In 2004, Netflix was sued for false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery".[249]
Also, in 2015, Netflix was caught up in a copyright lawsuit of international scope involving the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.[250][251]
Netflix was also sued in 2016 because Netflix told subscribers in marketing material that they "would not increase monthly subscription prices as long as the subscribers maintained the subscription service continuously," However, Netflix announced that it would “phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest tenured members getting the longest benefit.” The according to the class action, "Netflix has broken its contract with these subscribers by unilaterally raising monthly subscription prices".[252]

Effects and legacy[edit]
The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just binge straight into the next episode.[253] Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.[254]
Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective.[255] Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.[256] Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.[257]
In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.[258]

This streaming service is also available in Canada and by 2012, all of Central and South America. 

IT Priorities:
• Increasing spending within the area of cloud research, in order to keep pace with startup streaming companies.
• Migrating the relational data warehousing environment from Teradata to Amazon's Redshift platform.
• Increasing spending within the company's Hadoop supported cloud data warehouse environment. 
• In the process of migrating all data in favor of Amazon Web Services and the cloud. The data center for corporate IT will be eliminated at the end of this process by the end of 2014. 
• In the process of implementing a bring your own device (BYOD) program. In regards to security, the company plans to focus on content security, not device security. They do not plan to have a mobile device management (MDM) policy. 

IT Structure:
• Internal IT is one of the many technology divisions under the Chief Product Officer. The other divisions are Cloud Operations, Content Delivery, Product Development, and eCommerce. The work of these five divisions often overlap.

IT Vendors:
• Cloud solutions is hosted by Amazon Web Services. 

IT Intelligence Snippets:

• Netflix has selected Janitor Monkey's cloud solution to assist in cleaning up unused storage space within the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environment. 
• Partnered with big data specialist Sumo Logic, in order to analyze its customer base.
• Announced plans to offer its own content delivery network, which will help spread bandwidth burden beyond regular Internet providers.
• Selected Intequus as its systems integrator to design and manufacture its data center appliances.
• The company is completely virtualized.

Enterprise:
• The most reliable method of contact for Netflix employees is via email. The company is relying less and less on phone numbers and voice mails.

Hulu: Frequently Asked Questions

  We put together this list of frequently asked questions about the Hulu subscription service. If you have a question
  that is not answered on this list, please feel free to contact our customer service team, 
  who will be more than happy to answer any questions you may have.  



What do I get with my Hulu subscription?

The Hulu subscription service streams current episodes, full seasons and a deep library of back seasons of hit
        TV shows from major broadcast and cable networks. We also have a wide assortment of kids programming, movies,
        Latino programming and much more. With a subscription, you can stream on a variety of connected devices, like
        TVs, tablets and phones, from almost anywhere with an Internet connection.
You can explore some complimentary programming on Hulu.com on the web, but for the full experience, including
        unlimited access to Hulu’s library of shows and access on all your devices, you will need a subscription.
If you have not previously subscribed to Hulu, you can sign up for a free trial of a Hulu subscription at
        www.hulu.com/start.



What is the difference between a Hulu subscription and the free Hulu service?

The free Hulu experience only has a limited number of episodes to watch, while a Hulu subscription offers
        unlimited access to our full library including current-season episodes from popular shows such as Scandal,
        Family Guy, Once Upon A Time, New Girl, Saturday Night Live, Modern Family
        and many more. You can also watch every episode from every season of shows like South Park, Empire,
        Sons of Anarchy, The Mindy Project, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Nashville,
        Law and Order: SVU and many more. We also offer a full range of Hulu Originals – unique series you can’t
        watch anywhere else. 
We’re adding new shows all the time – both popular hit shows and Hulu Originals, so you’ll never run out of
        things to watch on Hulu. With a subscription, you can watch Hulu on connected TVs, tablets, phones and PCs. To
        see a full list of everything you can watch with a Hulu subscription, please visit:
        www.hulu.com/start/content



Why are there are commercials on Hulu?

Commercials are included on Hulu in order to reduce the monthly subscription price of the service. We try our
        best to tailor advertising to your interests so that the advertising you see on Hulu is relevant and useful to
        you.



What happened to "Hulu Plus"?

We’ve streamlined everything to just call ourselves Hulu. Your Hulu subscription is exactly the same as what
        we used to call a Hulu Plus subscription. Same full access to our library. Same great experience. Same access
        across all your devices.
When we first launched a subscription service, we called it Hulu Plus to differentiate it from the free Hulu
        service. But gradually we realized that everyone just called us "Hulu." It’s as simple as that.  Although we
        offer different subscription plans and access points, you are always getting your content from Hulu, and we will
        always stand behind the quality of our service under one name - Hulu.



What devices can I use to watch Hulu?

Hulu is available with a subscription on connected TVs, tablets, phones and PCs. You can use a variety of
        connected devices to watch including Roku, Apple TV, PlayStation® 3 and 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii, Wii U
        and Internet-connected TVs and Blu-ray players from Sony, Samsung and Vizio. 
To see a list of currently supported devices, please visit our
        Device page 
We are constantly evaluating new platforms and technologies and will add more devices based on feedback from
        you - our viewers.



Does the same subscription work on every enabled device?

Yes, your subscription follows you to any Hulu-enabled device. For example, you can start an episode on your
        phone and finish it on your internet-connected TV or tablet. You’ll also notice that Watchlist, our helpful tool
        that helps you track your favorites, can be used across your devices.



How many devices can I watch on at one time with my Hulu subscription?

A Hulu subscription is intended as a personal account. While you can access Hulu through multiple devices with
        your account, only one stream is allowed at a time. 



Why are there so many variations in show availability?

We understand that content availability differences can be confusing, and at times frustrating for our viewers.
We do our best to be as transparent as possible about what content is available to our subscribers and
        non-subscribers. Our subscribers receive access to our entire library. Our viewers who use the free Hulu service
        get access to only a portion of our content. 
For some shows, we have licensed the entire series and are able to allow subscribers access to every episode.
        For other shows, our license only covers the current season of the show. There are also some shows for which our
        license only covers the five most recent episodes at one time.
There are also variations in our license agreements for connected devices (TVs, tablet and phones) as compared
        to our PC licensing agreements.
We always do our best to communicate the most up-to-date, accurate and complete availability information to
        our viewers at all times.



What are the system requirements for Hulu?

To find the system requirements for your PC or other devices, please visit our
        help article



Can I access Hulu outside of the US?

Hulu is only accessible within the U.S. and on certain U.S. overseas military installations at this time, as
        we only have streaming rights for our content in these regions.

Hulu: Frequently Asked Questions

  We put together this list of frequently asked questions about the Hulu subscription service. If you have a question
  that is not answered on this list, please feel free to contact our customer service team, 
  who will be more than happy to answer any questions you may have.  



What do I get with my Hulu subscription?

The Hulu subscription service streams current episodes, full seasons and a deep library of back seasons of hit
        TV shows from major broadcast and cable networks. We also have a wide assortment of kids programming, movies,
        Latino programming and much more. With a subscription, you can stream on a variety of connected devices, like
        TVs, tablets and phones, from almost anywhere with an Internet connection.
You can explore some complimentary programming on Hulu.com on the web, but for the full experience, including
        unlimited access to Hulu’s library of shows and access on all your devices, you will need a subscription.
If you have not previously subscribed to Hulu, you can sign up for a free trial of a Hulu subscription at
        www.hulu.com/start.



What is the difference between a Hulu subscription and the free Hulu service?

The free Hulu experience only has a limited number of episodes to watch, while a Hulu subscription offers
        unlimited access to our full library including current-season episodes from popular shows such as Scandal,
        Family Guy, Once Upon A Time, New Girl, Saturday Night Live, Modern Family
        and many more. You can also watch every episode from every season of shows like South Park, Empire,
        Sons of Anarchy, The Mindy Project, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Nashville,
        Law and Order: SVU and many more. We also offer a full range of Hulu Originals – unique series you can’t
        watch anywhere else. 
We’re adding new shows all the time – both popular hit shows and Hulu Originals, so you’ll never run out of
        things to watch on Hulu. With a subscription, you can watch Hulu on connected TVs, tablets, phones and PCs. To
        see a full list of everything you can watch with a Hulu subscription, please visit:
        www.hulu.com/start/content



Why are there are commercials on Hulu?

Commercials are included on Hulu in order to reduce the monthly subscription price of the service. We try our
        best to tailor advertising to your interests so that the advertising you see on Hulu is relevant and useful to
        you.



What happened to "Hulu Plus"?

We’ve streamlined everything to just call ourselves Hulu. Your Hulu subscription is exactly the same as what
        we used to call a Hulu Plus subscription. Same full access to our library. Same great experience. Same access
        across all your devices.
When we first launched a subscription service, we called it Hulu Plus to differentiate it from the free Hulu
        service. But gradually we realized that everyone just called us "Hulu." It’s as simple as that.  Although we
        offer different subscription plans and access points, you are always getting your content from Hulu, and we will
        always stand behind the quality of our service under one name - Hulu.



What devices can I use to watch Hulu?

Hulu is available with a subscription on connected TVs, tablets, phones and PCs. You can use a variety of
        connected devices to watch including Roku, Apple TV, PlayStation® 3 and 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii, Wii U
        and Internet-connected TVs and Blu-ray players from Sony, Samsung and Vizio. 
To see a list of currently supported devices, please visit our
        Device page 
We are constantly evaluating new platforms and technologies and will add more devices based on feedback from
        you - our viewers.



Does the same subscription work on every enabled device?

Yes, your subscription follows you to any Hulu-enabled device. For example, you can start an episode on your
        phone and finish it on your internet-connected TV or tablet. You’ll also notice that Watchlist, our helpful tool
        that helps you track your favorites, can be used across your devices.



How many devices can I watch on at one time with my Hulu subscription?

A Hulu subscription is intended as a personal account. While you can access Hulu through multiple devices with
        your account, only one stream is allowed at a time. 



Why are there so many variations in show availability?

We understand that content availability differences can be confusing, and at times frustrating for our viewers.
We do our best to be as transparent as possible about what content is available to our subscribers and
        non-subscribers. Our subscribers receive access to our entire library. Our viewers who use the free Hulu service
        get access to only a portion of our content. 
For some shows, we have licensed the entire series and are able to allow subscribers access to every episode.
        For other shows, our license only covers the current season of the show. There are also some shows for which our
        license only covers the five most recent episodes at one time.
There are also variations in our license agreements for connected devices (TVs, tablet and phones) as compared
        to our PC licensing agreements.
We always do our best to communicate the most up-to-date, accurate and complete availability information to
        our viewers at all times.



What are the system requirements for Hulu?

To find the system requirements for your PC or other devices, please visit our
        help article



Can I access Hulu outside of the US?

Hulu is only accessible within the U.S. and on certain U.S. overseas military installations at this time, as
        we only have streaming rights for our content in these regions.

Netflix is an American entertainment company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.[6] It specializes in and provides streaming media and video-on-demand online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into film and television production, as well as online distribution. As of 2017, the company has its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental by mail business.[6][7] In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010[8] and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.[9]
Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series, House of Cards. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "Netflix Original" content through its online library of films and television.[10] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
In July 2017, Netflix reported having 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the United States.[12]

Founding and establishment[edit]




Netflix's headquarters in Los Gatos, California


Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph[13][14] and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria Corporation. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.[15]
Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[16][7] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.[15] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.[15]
Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,[15] with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.[17][15]
Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start[edit]
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[18] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was declined.[19] Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[20]
Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.[21]
Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion[edit]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[22]
In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,[23] and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[24][25]
In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.[26][27] That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.[28] As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).[29] By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.[30] By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.[31]
Early Netflix Original content[edit]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[32] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[33][34]
Entertainment dominance and presence, and continued growth[edit]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[35] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[36]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[37] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[38][39][40] Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not.[41] However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.[42]
In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.[43] But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.[44][45] Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.[46] On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.[47] On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.[48]

In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[49] Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."[49] The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news.[50] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."[51][52]
In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies.[53] On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.[54] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.[55]
Rebranding and VPN blockage[edit]
In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.[56] In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.[57] In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.[58]
At the 2016 CES Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"[59] A notable absence was China which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.[59] By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.[60]
Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs.[61] At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.[62] By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.[63]
In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.[64] On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers.[65]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Netflix shares are mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.[66]
Services[edit]
Netflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles, and smart TVs[67] According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.[68]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[69] Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.[70]
Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.[71][72][73]
On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.[74][75][76]
History[edit]




Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix and the first CEO of the company.






Reed Hastings, co-founder and the current CEO.


On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[77]
In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[78]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[79] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.[80] Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[80] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:

"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."[79]

In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[81]
Disc rental[edit]
In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States[82] The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight[citation needed] DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-Ray disc for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.[83]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[84][85][86] In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
Qwikster[edit]
On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.[87][88][89][90]
On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.[89][90][91]
In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[92][93][94]
Profiles[edit]
In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.[95] Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.[96] However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,[97][98][99] Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.[100] In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."[101]
Reintroduction[edit]
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".[102] Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".[102] Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,[102][103] since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.[103] Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".[104]
Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.[105]
Critics of the feature have noted:

New profiles are created as "blank slates",[105] but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.[106]
People don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) – whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile[104][105][106]

In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.[105][106]
Products[edit]




An Aquos remote control with a Netflix button


In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[107]
Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.[108][109]
In May 2016, it created a new tool called FAST to determine how fast one's Internet connection is.[110]
Content[edit]
Netflix Originals[edit]
Further information: List of original programs distributed by Netflix
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[11]
In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and stars Kevin Spacey.[111] In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[112][113] Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.[114]
In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo FAST, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July.[115][116] Netflix has distributed over a dozen other animated family and kid shows, including All Hail King Julien, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Dawn of the Croods, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Kulipari: An Army of Frogs.











Logos of some Netflix original programs


Orange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013.[117] In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series.[118][119] In February 2016, Orange is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season.
In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live action series' Marvel superhero-focused: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015.[120][121][122] The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, with the miniseries of The Defenders and Iron Fist scheduled for a 2017 release. In April 2016 the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include an 13-episode series of The Punisher.[123][124] In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.[125]
In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.[126] The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.[127]
The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski[128] Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.
Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction supernatural drama Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama The Get Down in August, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house.[129]
In January 2017, Netflix announced all Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.[130] The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.[131]
In April 2017, Netflix confirmed it had reached a licensing deal for original Netflix content with iQiYi, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu.[132]
Canceled programs[edit]
As of 2017, Netflix has canceled eight shows.[133][134][135] They are:

Longmire - canceled after six seasons, three of which aired on Netflix
Lilyhammer - canceled after three seasons
Hemlock Grove - canceled after three seasons
Marco Polo - canceled after two seasons
The Get Down - canceled after one season
Sense8 - canceled after two seasons (renewed for final episode)
Richie Rich - canceled after two seasons
Girlboss - canceled after one season

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films catalogued in Netflix's United States library include recent releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures,[136] as well as DreamWorks Animation,[137] Open Road Films[138] (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights[139]), FilmDistrict,[140] The Weinstein Company,[141][142] Sony Pictures Animation,[143] and the Walt Disney Studios catalog among others.
Other distributors who have sold back-catalog rights to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Disney–ABC Television Group, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television, Hasbro Studios, Saban Brands and CBS Television Distribution. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Sony Pictures Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library.[144]
Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service.[145] These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[146][147]
On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service.[148] However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[149]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[150] Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal.[151] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[152][153]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[154] However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and many of the channel's shows were removed in March 2015.[155] Most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.[156]
In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox, distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.[157]
In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch."[158] He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that "[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".[159]

4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting HDCP 2.2. Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[179][180][181]
Sales and marketing[edit]
Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a Compete.com survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.[182]
During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.[183]
In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.[184]

Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu, in 2010.[197]
Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.[198] On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.[199] On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.[200] (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)[201]
In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,[202] which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.[203] In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).[204]
Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012.[205] In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service,[206] which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"[207] due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."[208]
CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".[209]
Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."[210]
Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering pornography, but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarDVD and WantedList.[211][212]
In Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services Stan and Quickflix.[213] In Scandinavia, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More.[214][215] In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ,[216] Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix.[217] In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix.[citation needed] In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision.[citation needed] In South Africa, Netflix competes with ShowMax.[218] In the Middle East, Netflix competes with Starz Play Arabia.
In Mexico, when Televisa tried to create its own streaming service called Blim, it was heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,[219][220] Netflix themselves also criticized the poor quality of the productions content made by Televisa.[221]
Time Warner[edit]
In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."[222] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."[223]
Awards[edit]
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by Netflix
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[224] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[224][225] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[226] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[227]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards.[228] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[229][230][231] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[232]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[233]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.[234] The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[234]
In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.
Finance and revenue[edit]
2010[edit]
In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.[235]
2011[edit]
In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.[236]
At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[237][238] However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.[239] By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.[240][241] Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.[242]
2014[edit]
In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.[243] The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to Forbes,[244] "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".[245]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.[246] Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;[247] this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).[248]
Legal issues and controversies[edit]
Main article: Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix
In 2004, Netflix was sued for false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery".[249]
Also, in 2015, Netflix was caught up in a copyright lawsuit of international scope involving the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.[250][251]
Netflix was also sued in 2016 because Netflix told subscribers in marketing material that they "would not increase monthly subscription prices as long as the subscribers maintained the subscription service continuously," However, Netflix announced that it would “phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest tenured members getting the longest benefit.” The according to the class action, "Netflix has broken its contract with these subscribers by unilaterally raising monthly subscription prices".[252]

Effects and legacy[edit]
The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just binge straight into the next episode.[253] Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.[254]
Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective.[255] Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.[256] Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.[257]
In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.[258]

Netflix is an American entertainment company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.[6] It specializes in and provides streaming media and video-on-demand online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into film and television production, as well as online distribution. As of 2017, the company has its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental by mail business.[6][7] In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010[8] and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.[9]
Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series, House of Cards. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "Netflix Original" content through its online library of films and television.[10] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
In July 2017, Netflix reported having 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the United States.[12]

Founding and establishment[edit]




Netflix's headquarters in Los Gatos, California


Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph[13][14] and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria Corporation. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.[15]
Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[16][7] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.[15] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.[15]
Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,[15] with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.[17][15]
Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start[edit]
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[18] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was declined.[19] Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[20]
Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.[21]
Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion[edit]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[22]
In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,[23] and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[24][25]
In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.[26][27] That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.[28] As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).[29] By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.[30] By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.[31]
Early Netflix Original content[edit]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[32] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[33][34]
Entertainment dominance and presence, and continued growth[edit]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[35] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[36]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[37] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[38][39][40] Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not.[41] However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.[42]
In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.[43] But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.[44][45] Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.[46] On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.[47] On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.[48]

In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[49] Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."[49] The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news.[50] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."[51][52]
In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies.[53] On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.[54] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.[55]
Rebranding and VPN blockage[edit]
In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.[56] In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.[57] In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.[58]
At the 2016 CES Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"[59] A notable absence was China which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.[59] By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.[60]
Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs.[61] At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.[62] By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.[63]
In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.[64] On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers.[65]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Netflix shares are mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.[66]
Services[edit]
Netflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles, and smart TVs[67] According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.[68]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[69] Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.[70]
Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.[71][72][73]
On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.[74][75][76]
History[edit]




Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix and the first CEO of the company.






Reed Hastings, co-founder and the current CEO.


On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[77]
In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[78]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[79] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.[80] Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[80] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:

"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."[79]

In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[81]
Disc rental[edit]
In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States[82] The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight[citation needed] DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-Ray disc for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.[83]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[84][85][86] In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
Qwikster[edit]
On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.[87][88][89][90]
On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.[89][90][91]
In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[92][93][94]
Profiles[edit]
In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.[95] Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.[96] However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,[97][98][99] Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.[100] In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."[101]
Reintroduction[edit]
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".[102] Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".[102] Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,[102][103] since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.[103] Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".[104]
Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.[105]
Critics of the feature have noted:

New profiles are created as "blank slates",[105] but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.[106]
People don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) – whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile[104][105][106]

In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.[105][106]
Products[edit]




An Aquos remote control with a Netflix button


In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[107]
Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.[108][109]
In May 2016, it created a new tool called FAST to determine how fast one's Internet connection is.[110]
Content[edit]
Netflix Originals[edit]
Further information: List of original programs distributed by Netflix
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[11]
In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and stars Kevin Spacey.[111] In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[112][113] Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.[114]
In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo FAST, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July.[115][116] Netflix has distributed over a dozen other animated family and kid shows, including All Hail King Julien, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Dawn of the Croods, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Kulipari: An Army of Frogs.











Logos of some Netflix original programs


Orange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013.[117] In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series.[118][119] In February 2016, Orange is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season.
In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live action series' Marvel superhero-focused: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015.[120][121][122] The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, with the miniseries of The Defenders and Iron Fist scheduled for a 2017 release. In April 2016 the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include an 13-episode series of The Punisher.[123][124] In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.[125]
In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.[126] The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.[127]
The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski[128] Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.
Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction supernatural drama Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama The Get Down in August, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house.[129]
In January 2017, Netflix announced all Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.[130] The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.[131]
In April 2017, Netflix confirmed it had reached a licensing deal for original Netflix content with iQiYi, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu.[132]
Canceled programs[edit]
As of 2017, Netflix has canceled eight shows.[133][134][135] They are:

Longmire - canceled after six seasons, three of which aired on Netflix
Lilyhammer - canceled after three seasons
Hemlock Grove - canceled after three seasons
Marco Polo - canceled after two seasons
The Get Down - canceled after one season
Sense8 - canceled after two seasons (renewed for final episode)
Richie Rich - canceled after two seasons
Girlboss - canceled after one season

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films catalogued in Netflix's United States library include recent releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures,[136] as well as DreamWorks Animation,[137] Open Road Films[138] (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights[139]), FilmDistrict,[140] The Weinstein Company,[141][142] Sony Pictures Animation,[143] and the Walt Disney Studios catalog among others.
Other distributors who have sold back-catalog rights to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Disney–ABC Television Group, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television, Hasbro Studios, Saban Brands and CBS Television Distribution. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Sony Pictures Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library.[144]
Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service.[145] These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[146][147]
On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service.[148] However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[149]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[150] Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal.[151] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[152][153]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[154] However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and many of the channel's shows were removed in March 2015.[155] Most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.[156]
In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox, distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.[157]
In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch."[158] He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that "[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".[159]

4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting HDCP 2.2. Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[179][180][181]
Sales and marketing[edit]
Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a Compete.com survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.[182]
During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.[183]
In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.[184]

As of May 2017, Netflix officially supports 20 languages for user interface and customer support purposes: Arabic (Modern Standard), Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian (Bokmål), Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian and European), Romanian, Spanish (Castilian and Standard), Swedish, Thai and Turkish.
Competitors[edit]

Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu, in 2010.[197]
Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.[198] On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.[199] On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.[200] (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)[201]
In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,[202] which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.[203] In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).[204]
Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012.[205] In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service,[206] which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"[207] due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."[208]
CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".[209]
Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."[210]
Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering pornography, but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarDVD and WantedList.[211][212]
In Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services Stan and Quickflix.[213] In Scandinavia, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More.[214][215] In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ,[216] Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix.[217] In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix.[citation needed] In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision.[citation needed] In South Africa, Netflix competes with ShowMax.[218] In the Middle East, Netflix competes with Starz Play Arabia.
In Mexico, when Televisa tried to create its own streaming service called Blim, it was heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,[219][220] Netflix themselves also criticized the poor quality of the productions content made by Televisa.[221]
Time Warner[edit]
In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."[222] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."[223]
Awards[edit]
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by Netflix
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[224] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[224][225] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[226] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[227]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards.[228] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[229][230][231] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[232]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[233]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.[234] The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[234]
In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.
Finance and revenue[edit]
2010[edit]
In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.[235]
2011[edit]
In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.[236]
At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[237][238] However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.[239] By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.[240][241] Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.[242]
2014[edit]
In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.[243] The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to Forbes,[244] "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".[245]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.[246] Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;[247] this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).[248]
Legal issues and controversies[edit]
Main article: Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix
In 2004, Netflix was sued for false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery".[249]
Also, in 2015, Netflix was caught up in a copyright lawsuit of international scope involving the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.[250][251]
Netflix was also sued in 2016 because Netflix told subscribers in marketing material that they "would not increase monthly subscription prices as long as the subscribers maintained the subscription service continuously," However, Netflix announced that it would “phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest tenured members getting the longest benefit.” The according to the class action, "Netflix has broken its contract with these subscribers by unilaterally raising monthly subscription prices".[252]

Effects and legacy[edit]
The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just binge straight into the next episode.[253] Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.[254]
Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective.[255] Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.[256] Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.[257]
In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.[258]

Netflix is an American entertainment company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.[6] It specializes in and provides streaming media and video-on-demand online and DVD by mail. In 2013, Netflix expanded into film and television production, as well as online distribution. As of 2017, the company has its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental by mail business.[6][7] In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010[8] and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries.[9]
Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series, House of Cards. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering "Netflix Original" content through its online library of films and television.[10] Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
In July 2017, Netflix reported having 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the United States.[12]

Founding and establishment[edit]




Netflix's headquarters in Los Gatos, California


Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph[13][14] and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria Corporation. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. He and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger.[15]
Hastings, Randolph's mother and Integrity QA founder Steve Kahn invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[16][7] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry.[15] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.[15]
Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998,[15] with only 30 employees and 925 DVDs available through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster.[17][15]
Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start[edit]
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,[18] and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

In 2000, Netflix offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was declined.[19] Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[20]
Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.[21]
Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion[edit]
Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.[22]
In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,[23] and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.[24][25]
In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period.[26][27] That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013.[28] As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States).[29] By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers.[30] By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries.[31]
Early Netflix Original content[edit]
Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[32] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.[33][34]
Entertainment dominance and presence, and continued growth[edit]
Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.[35] The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[36]
By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[37] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[38][39][40] Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not.[41] However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.[42]
In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide.[43] But on October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during Q3 2011, and more losses were expected in Q4 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for Q3 2011.[44][45] Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion.[46] On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period.[47] On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.[48]

In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[49] Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as "another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda."[49] The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news.[50] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."[51][52]
In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies.[53] On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access "Watched by your friends" and "Friends' Favorites" by agreeing.[54] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.[55]
Rebranding and VPN blockage[edit]
In April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world.[56] In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface.[57] In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.[58]
At the 2016 CES Netflix announced their expansion into 130 additional countries. which BBC noted meant that the service was now available in "almost all the world"[59] A notable absence was China which Hastings stated the company was still trying to expand into.[59] By October of that year the company, citing the difficulty of entering the market, announced that they were instead now focused on licensing individual pieces of content to the country.[60]
Also in January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs.[61] At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion.[62] By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.[63]
In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee the rights to Netflix's original productions outside of the United States.[64] On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers.[65]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Netflix shares are mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.[66]
Services[edit]
Netflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles, and smart TVs[67] According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.[68]
When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[69] Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.[70]
Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.[71][72][73]
On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.[74][75][76]
History[edit]




Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix and the first CEO of the company.






Reed Hastings, co-founder and the current CEO.


On October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to "Watch Instantly", under Starz Play.[77]
In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[78]
On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[79] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall.[80] Twitter comments spiked a negative "Dear Netflix" trend.[80] The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:

"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."[79]

In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[81]
Disc rental[edit]
In the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States[82] The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent, the subscriber must reply the previous in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.
Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. Subscribers' accounts in active, current status offers plans with up to eight[citation needed] DVDs simultaneously. Gift subscriptions are available. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-Ray disc for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.[83]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, with similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[84][85][86] In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing, allowing more flexibility for customers. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.
Qwikster[edit]
On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.[87][88][89][90]
On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. However, the pricing increase was not reversed. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.[89][90][91]
In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[92][93][94]
Profiles[edit]
In June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature.[95] Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience.[96] However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users,[97][98][99] Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement.[100] In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, "Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone," then explained its reversal: "Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility."[101]
Reintroduction[edit]
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".[102] Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".[102] Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,[102][103] since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.[103] Neil Hunt, Netflix's Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".[104]
Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.[105]
Critics of the feature have noted:

New profiles are created as "blank slates",[105] but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.[106]
People don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) – whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile[104][105][106]

In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.[105][106]
Products[edit]




An Aquos remote control with a Netflix button


In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[107]
Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called "The Switch" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. "The Switch" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.[108][109]
In May 2016, it created a new tool called FAST to determine how fast one's Internet connection is.[110]
Content[edit]
Netflix Originals[edit]
Further information: List of original programs distributed by Netflix
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[11]
In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and stars Kevin Spacey.[111] In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[112][113] Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.[114]
In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo FAST, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July.[115][116] Netflix has distributed over a dozen other animated family and kid shows, including All Hail King Julien, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Dawn of the Croods, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Kulipari: An Army of Frogs.











Logos of some Netflix original programs


Orange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013.[117] In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series.[118][119] In February 2016, Orange is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season.
In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live action series' Marvel superhero-focused: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015.[120][121][122] The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, with the miniseries of The Defenders and Iron Fist scheduled for a 2017 release. In April 2016 the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include an 13-episode series of The Punisher.[123][124] In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.[125]
In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service.[126] The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.[127]
The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski[128] Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.
Netflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction supernatural drama Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, the music-driven drama The Get Down in August, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[11]
The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house.[129]
In January 2017, Netflix announced all Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.[130] The website expects to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.[131]
In April 2017, Netflix confirmed it had reached a licensing deal for original Netflix content with iQiYi, a Chinese video streaming platform owned by Baidu.[132]
Canceled programs[edit]
As of 2017, Netflix has canceled eight shows.[133][134][135] They are:

Longmire - canceled after six seasons, three of which aired on Netflix
Lilyhammer - canceled after three seasons
Hemlock Grove - canceled after three seasons
Marco Polo - canceled after two seasons
The Get Down - canceled after one season
Sense8 - canceled after two seasons (renewed for final episode)
Richie Rich - canceled after two seasons
Girlboss - canceled after one season

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. As of 2014, films catalogued in Netflix's United States library include recent releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures,[136] as well as DreamWorks Animation,[137] Open Road Films[138] (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights[139]), FilmDistrict,[140] The Weinstein Company,[141][142] Sony Pictures Animation,[143] and the Walt Disney Studios catalog among others.
Other distributors who have sold back-catalog rights to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Walt Disney Studios. Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Disney–ABC Television Group, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television, Hasbro Studios, Saban Brands and CBS Television Distribution. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Sony Pictures Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library.[144]
Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service.[145] These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[146][147]
On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service.[148] However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[149]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[150] Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal.[151] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[152][153]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[154] However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and many of the channel's shows were removed in March 2015.[155] Most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.[156]
In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox, distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.[157]
In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix couldn't "afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch."[158] He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that "[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place".[159]

4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting HDCP 2.2. Streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this is limited to Intel Kaby Lake (seventh-generation Intel Core), Windows 10, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the UWP Netflix app.[179][180][181]
Sales and marketing[edit]
Netflix's website attracted at least 194 million visitors annually, according to a Compete.com survey from 2008. This was about five times the number of visitors to Blockbuster's main website.[182]
During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-ray discs plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.[183]
In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett – former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing – to become its new Chief Marketing Officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.[184]

Competitors[edit]
See also: Online DVD rental and Video on demand
Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu, in 2010.[197]
Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service. This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.[198] On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.[199] On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor.[200] (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its "Blockbuster on Demand" video streaming service open.)[201]
In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor,[202] which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011.[203] In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).[204]
Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012.[205] In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service,[206] which was described by critics as "No netflix killer"[207] due to "glitches [and] lackluster selection."[208]
CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the "new Netflix for non-fiction".[209]
Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, "ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content", requiring Netflix "not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy."[210]
Netflix and Blockbuster largely avoid offering pornography, but several "adult video" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarDVD and WantedList.[211][212]
In Australia, Netflix competes with several local streaming companies, most notably locally operated services Stan and Quickflix.[213] In Scandinavia, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More.[214][215] In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ,[216] Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix.[217] In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix.[citation needed] In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity (Mediaset), Sky Online and TIMvision.[citation needed] In South Africa, Netflix competes with ShowMax.[218] In the Middle East, Netflix competes with Starz Play Arabia.
In Mexico, when Televisa tried to create its own streaming service called Blim, it was heavily criticized for not understanding millennials,[219][220] Netflix themselves also criticized the poor quality of the productions content made by Televisa.[221]
Time Warner[edit]
In a 2010 New York Times interview, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes downplayed Netflix as a threat to more traditional media companies. Bewkes told the newspaper, "It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don't think so." At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close."[222] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available before[…]Our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point."[223]
Awards[edit]
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by Netflix
On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[224] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[224][225] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[226] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[227]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards.[228] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[229][230][231] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[232]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[233]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable.[234] The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[234]
In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.
Finance and revenue[edit]
2010[edit]
In 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.[235]
2011[edit]
In April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59¢ on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.[236]
At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130.[237][238] However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that "two websites would make things more difficult", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%.[239] By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Neflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer.[240][241] Describing their business model as "broken", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to "underperform", the equivalent of sell.[242]
2014[edit]
In May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by £1.[243] The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of €1). According to Forbes,[244] "Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move" and "roughly $200–250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that "any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears".[245]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises.[246] Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016;[247] this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).[248]
Legal issues and controversies[edit]
Main article: Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix
In 2004, Netflix was sued for false advertising in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery".[249]
Also, in 2015, Netflix was caught up in a copyright lawsuit of international scope involving the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.[250][251]
Netflix was also sued in 2016 because Netflix told subscribers in marketing material that they "would not increase monthly subscription prices as long as the subscribers maintained the subscription service continuously," However, Netflix announced that it would “phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest tenured members getting the longest benefit.” The according to the class action, "Netflix has broken its contract with these subscribers by unilaterally raising monthly subscription prices".[252]

Effects and legacy[edit]
The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because they can just binge straight into the next episode.[253] Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.[254]
Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode in order to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards, "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series." Though traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, Spacey points out that in 2012, 113 pilots were made, 35 of those were chosen to go to air, 13 of those were renewed, and most of those are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective.[255] Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they are free from needing to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to traditional pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.
The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly eight out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.[256] Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.[257]
In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of the US government plot to influence the world culture, "to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.[258]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
