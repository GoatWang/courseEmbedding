Michael Goldberg

    By Haagan Schular

Hi, I wanted to share with you my before and after results. intially I always considered myself a healthy weight training individual. I lived an active lifestyle,went to the gym regularly and even used the best pre workout and post workout supplements. I used protein and creatine powders as well, but it wasn't until my first cycle of taking some true legal anabolic supplements, that I seen drastic improvements in my physique. My muscle growth and fat loss was amazing. My strength was just ridiculous and I was shocked that through all my internet research, I never even knew these amazing muscle pills existed ! My tip.....these products are most often referred to as "legal steroids" or "muscle building supplements". My first anabolic stack was the muscle labs 4 pack muscle growth kit. It consisted of the Dianabol aka "Dbol" , The Anadrol, aka "Drol" , Deccabolan aka "Deca-Steroid" and Wisndrol-V. My beofre and after photo was after using only 2 stacks !! (Note that I purchased 2 stacks and was given a 3rd for FREE). The time frame was approximately 90 Days from start to finish. I took the dianabol 3 times daily like morning, breakfast and dinner. I took my Deca once daily before bed. Than took my Anadrol with lunch, sometimes 2 tablets. I used my winsdrol as a pre workout supplement ,so I used 1-2 capsules about 30 minutes rior to training. As soon as I completed this cycle for about 40 days, I instantly repeated the cycle all over again.......obviously my anabolic cycle worked for me. My diet was relatively common sense......steak, chicken, rice,water, muscle milk and creatine. I ate about every hour, I noticed the anabolic supplements, especially the dianabol, made me hungry. Increase in hunger is a good indicator of anabolism which is your bodies way of saying "yo, I need more protein to feed this muscle". I ate just about every hour but I just made sure I ate something healthy. I will end my review on this note, I have since continued using other products from Muscle labs usa and I continue to improve. If you wanna bulk up, use the Dianabol and Anadrol, if you wanna get abs fast, use the winsdrol and deccabolan. I had no side effects at all, except my appetite and an increased sex drive. Without a doubt, these supplements work for building muscle mass and losing fat......simple as that. - Michael Goldberg Hi, I wanted to share with you my before and after results. intially I always considered myself a healthy weight training individual.
