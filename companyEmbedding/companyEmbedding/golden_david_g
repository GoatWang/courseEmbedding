The pigment manufacturer will no longer support the required pigment, and despite an exhaustive search, there is simply no other source to be found.

Managing Partner, Revolution Ventures




























                        PROFESSIONAL  EXPERIENCE
                    





David Golden, a native of Minnesota, co-leads Revolution Ventures in the San Francisco office, which invests in and helps build innovative and impactful companies. David has over three decades of industry experience and brings to bear his extensive history as a financier of emerging growth companies and understanding of capital markets with his unique abilities in negotiation and deal-structuring. David joined Revolution with Steve Case in 2006 and has since been an investing partner and strategic advisor.
David joined Revolution after 18 years with JPMorgan, and a predecessor firm, Hambrecht & Quist. During his tenure, David was named co-director of mergers and acquisitions in 1992, director of mergers and acquisitions in 1995, and co-director of investment banking in 1998. Most recently he was Vice Chairman and Director of JPMorgan’s global investment banking practice for technology, media and telecommunications clients and was a member of the investment bank’s management committee. During these years, he acted as lead merger advisor, equity underwriter or investor on over 150 transactions. From 1990 to 1992, David was a vice president at Allen & Company in New York.
In 2010, David helped found Code Advisors, a next-generation investment bank in San Francisco focused on the intersection of strategy and finance for emerging technology companies; and he served as Code’s Executive Chairman through 2012.
Early in his career, David was an associate at the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell in New York and London, where he practiced corporate finance and securities law. Prior to practicing law, David was a law clerk to the Honorable Charles M. Merrill of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. David received an A.B. from Harvard University (magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa) in 1980 and a J.D. from Harvard Law School (cum laude) in 1983, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review.
He serves or has served on the boards of many companies including current Revolution companies Insikt, MemberSuite, PolicyGenius, Everyday Health and Busbud and previously-exited companies including Revolution Money (acquired by American Express) and Extend Health (acquired by Towers Watson). He also serves on the boards of Barnes & Noble Education and Blackbaud.













                        The partners at Revolution have been investing together for a decade, and our interests are completely aligned. We have a continuity of purpose in our mission that is refreshing to our investors and the companies we invest in.

Published Reviews

 "It provides a systematic approach to the care of the critically ill/injured child during the initial hour after presentation. A particularly relevant new chapter on terrorism and mass casualty events is extremely informative.The quality of this book is exceptional for the targeted audience. The inclusion of new chapters on terrorism and mass casualty events justifies the replacement of the previous edition." - Richelle Monier, MD (Ochsner Clinic Foundation) 5 star Doody Rating!
