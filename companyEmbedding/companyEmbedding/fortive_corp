Our History






Fortive, The Essential Technology Company
Although Fortive is a new company, our roots run deep. Our portfolio is built with strong brands that are established leaders in the markets they serve. Our operating companies have long histories of solving customers’ critical needs. And our heritage dates back to the earliest days of the globally renowned Danaher Corporation. This singular combination of past success and forward-focused innovation makes Fortive uniquely positioned to create, implement and accelerate progress.
 
Foundation
In the early 1980s, Steven and Mitchell Rales envisioned a manufacturing company dedicated to continuous improvement and customer satisfaction, which led to the creation of Danaher. Danaher was one of the first companies in North America to adopt the principles of kaizen, a Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement, and its unique and rigorous interpretation of this approach shaped the Danaher Business System (DBS). Fortive’s leaders have deep experience overseeing and implementing DBS, and will continue to guide its evolution as the Fortive Business System (FBS). Our business will evolve, but the guiding principles of FBS—continuous improvement and customer satisfaction—remain steadfast.  
Focus
One of the keys to Danaher’s success was its creation of strategic platforms, each with sustainable competitive advantages and leadership positions in attractive markets. Over the years, Danaher’s portfolio evolved into an increasingly global, growth-oriented set of scientific and technological businesses, generating over $20B in revenue in 2015. In July 2016, Danaher separated into two independent, publicly traded companies: Danaher and Fortive. Fortive is now a focused industrial growth company driving innovation in the areas of field instrumentation, transportation, sensing, product realization, automation and specialty, and franchise distribution.
 
Future 
Fortive’s 24,000 global employees are united by a shared culture and led by experienced executives with over 100 years of combined Danaher experience. We are agile, inquisitive innovators who draw upon our strong tradition of success.
Everything we do is designed for a world that thrives on speed and rigor, and we are deeply committed to delivering essential technology that makes the world stronger, safer and better. We are passionate about powering progress at a global scale to advance the greater good.
This is our vision for the future—the vision we're aggressively pursuing—as we build a global diversified industrial growth company to drive the world’s essential technologies forward. Fortive is strength in motion.

Better Buy: Danaher Corporation vs. Fortive Corp
We compare the investment proposition of the legacy company with the company spun off in 2016. Which stock is more attractive in 2017, and why? 











                Lee Samaha
            

                (TMFSaintGermain)



            
            Mar 9, 2017 at 9:51AM
            
            





Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) vs. Fortive Corp. (NYSE:FTV) makes for one of the most interesting comparisons in the industrial sector. Of course, there is nothing stopping you from owning both stocks -- in fact, before the spin-off of Fortive in July 2016, investors did own both businesses as a set -- and certainly their differing investment propositions would provide diversification.However, the split has created two significantly different companies, so let's take a look at the contrasting investment cases for the two stocks. 
Why Fortive Corp. was spun off
The rationale behind the spinoff was the creation of two separate companies, with differing investment profiles, in order for their management teams to better focus on growing their respective core businesses.
Essentially, Danaher now consists of the legacy company's life sciences, diagnostics, dental, water quality, and product ID segments, and the acquired Pall Corp. (mainly life sciences) and Cepheid (diagnostics) businesses. Fortive comprises the legacy company's test and measurement, retail fueling, telematics, and automation businesses.

Image source: Fortive Corp.

Cyclical growth vs. Defensive growth
There are three key differences between the two companies.
First, around 80% of Danaher's revenue comes from life sciences, diagnostics, and dental end markets. In other words, it's arguably not an industrial stock anymore, and has relatively defensive end markets. Meanwhile, Fortive's motley collection of industrial businesses should give far more exposure to the cyclicality of economic growth.
Considering that most forecasters are predicting a pickup in industrial production growth starting in 2017, and President Trump's emphasis on infrastructural spending and supporting US manufacturing would indicate that Fortive has more potential for upside surprise to its earnings in the next few years. 
Meanwhile, Danaher's end markets, although strong, don't have much cyclical upside, so if you are specifically looking for exposure to a the potential of a stronger economy then Fortive is the better choice.





Organic vs. acquisition growth
Second, the legacy Danaher company was noted for its acquisition strategy. This largely involved buying unloved companies and applying its so-called Danaher Business System (a set of lean manufacturing and continuous improvement principles) to them in order to raise their margin and return on capital. Rather amusingly, Fortive is now calling its application of the same principles the Fortive Business System.


These principles will look familiar to Fortive investors. Image source: Danaher Corporation.


While the new Danaher and Fortive are following the same principles, their relative positions are different in 2017. For example, Danaher already has Pall Corporation (a $13.8 billion acquisition in 2015) and Cepheid (a recent $4 billion acquisition) to fully integrate, while Fortive is hungrily on the mergers-and-acquisitions trail this year.
A quick look at both companies' fourth-quarter earnings reveals a lot about what to expect in 2017. For example, Danaher's core revenue grew 3.5% in the fourth quarter, acquisitions also contributed 4%, leaving reported revenue growth at 6% after a negative 1.5% foreign-currency impact is included. Meanwhile, core operating margin grew 170 basis points (100 basis points equals 1%) but was held back by a 50-basis-point reduction due to acquisitions, and a 40-basis-point reduction due to acquisition specific charges -- the end result was an 80-basis-point improvement. 
In short, Danaher's acquisitions hurt margin in the fourth-quarter, consequently its opportunity is to expand margins at the acquisitions going forward.
On the other hand, on the recent earnings call, Fortive's CEO James Lico affirmed that new "M&A continues to be our main priority" in 2017, and he later argued that the 2017 outlook for 3% to 7% EPS growth "doesn't assume any M&A" and "we expect to deploy some M&A, and that's the thing I think is going to take our ... earnings growth up over the next year or two."
The contrast in corporate strategy in 2017 is clear, Danaher is integrating, and generating organic growth this year, while Fortive is more hungry for acquisitions, and hoping those deals will help it grow in the future. 
Different margin and cash flow profiles
As you see in the chart below, Fortive commands higher margins and free cash flow (FCF). This is highly relevant because it will need cash flow to deploy in order to make acquisitions, while Danaher's opportunity lies in expanding its margin and FCF generation, particularly as it grows its sales of high-margin consumables -- currently at 65% of total sales.

DHR EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YCharts.






Danaher vs. Fortive
Based on the ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA, shown in the chart above, both stocks look more than fully valued. However, if I were forced to choose, I'd say Danaher looks the better bet. There is no shortage of stocks to buy to benefit from a cyclical recovery, so Fortive doesn't necessarily stand out there, and if the market keeps going up, then it's likely that Fortive will find it tougher to make the acquisitions it needs to get earnings growth into double figures in 2017.
On the other hand, Danaher's secular growth prospects are compelling, even if its valuation right now is not. Danaher can grow its valuation in time via internal execution, while Fortive needs acquisitions and strong economic growth.
The interesting thing about both stocks is that they would both look very attractive given a market slump -- Fortive would get to make acquisitions cheaper, and investors would get a better entry point into Danaher's long-term growth prospects. You may have to wait for this.

About Fortive






Foundation
Fortive is a new company with deep roots. Our portfolio is built with strong brands that are established leaders in the markets they serve. Our operating companies have long histories of solving customers’ critical needs. We originated from the $20B Danaher Corporation, bringing a committed leadership team and a powerful toolset for continuous improvement along. But our story is really just beginning.
Focus
Our successful separation from Danaher in July 2016 gave us a unique opportunity to focus on essential technology businesses driving exciting innovation in field instrumentation, transportation, sensing, product realization, automation and specialty, and franchise distribution. Our diverse teams around the globe are united by a shared culture and led by a uniquely qualified and experienced executive team.

"I feel really excited about how integrated our teams are. We sort of jump into each other’s space without even thinking about it, but that’s how we have rich, energetic discussions about things we are challenged by, and that’s how we come up with extraordinary results."

Future
Our customers and the technologies they depend on are moving faster than ever before. This rapid rate of change creates a world filled with exciting new opportunities, from precision sensors to the Internet of Things. We are more committed than ever to moving essential technologies forward.

"We’re here for our customers, especially when they need it most. It’s great to work for a company of continuous improvement, one that constantly strives to do better. We don’t just meet expectations, we strive to exceed them."

Danaher Completes Fortive Spin-Off, Trading to Begin TodayHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)Danaher Completes Fortive Spin-Off, Trading to Begin TodayZacks Equity ResearchZacksJuly 5, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareDanaher Corp. DHR wrapped up the spin-off of Fortive Corporation, completing the separation of its Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding its Product Identification platform) and Retail/Commercial Petroleum platform from its other operations.Danaher will retain its life sciences, dental, diagnostics, water quality and product identification segments.Fortive will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will begin trading today under the ticker “FTV”. To be headquartered in Everett, WA, Fortive will classify its operations under two segments, Professional Instrumentation and Industrial Technologies.In the split, Danaher shareholders received one share of the spun-off unit Fortive for every two shares of Danaher. About 345 million shares of Fortive common stock were distributed in the separation.  Some of Danaher’s leading brands, such as Fluke, Qualitrol, Tektronix, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Kollmorgen and Matco Tools will be included in Fortive. Notably, Fortive has established a strong financial, legal and organizational structure, which indicates bright prospects ahead.The split will enable both the companies to be more focused and nimble in their respective growth strategies, and will help them deliver on strategic priorities by pursuing high impact prospects.Danaher has consistently followed an aggressive acquisition strategy, and continues to explore expansion opportunities in targeted regions. The year 2015 saw the company close acquisition of 14 businesses worth approximately $14.5 billion.During the first quarter of 2016, Danaher closed six bolt-on acquisitions, including Hach's takeover of Lufft Mess, for over $100 million.DANAHER CORP PriceDANAHER CORP Price | DANAHER CORP Quote These acquired units complement Danaher’s existing units, while adding strong growth and strengthening the market presence of the company.During the third quarter of 2015, Danaher’s acquisition of Pall Corp. led its decision to split into two independent, publicly traded companies. We believe that the companies will unlock significant growth and operational synergies from this strategic separation, and will likely provide high value for customers, going forward.However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has been seeing weakness in its Instruments platform of late, which has witnessed a significant decline in revenues across all major geographies including the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America. Also, Danaher’s operations remain vulnerable to foreign currency headwinds, as a significant portion of its revenues is derived from regions outside the U.S.Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Carlisle Companies Incorporated CSL, Honeywell International Inc. HON and Leucadia National Corporation LUK, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
