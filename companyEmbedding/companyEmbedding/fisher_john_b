ABOUT NUTS




We deliver
UNMATCHED NUT QUALITY
At John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. we live for nuts. Since 1922, we have been dedicated to procuring, processing and packaging. It is our commitment to consistently deliver the highest quality products to our customer and consumer base. We pride ourselves on knowing everything there is to know about nuts. Check out our links below to discover even more!

Qualified Health Claim: Nuts and Coronary Heart Disease
Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts (such as almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachio nuts and walnuts) as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease (See nutrition information for fat content).





ALMONDS



CASHEWS



HAZELNUTS/FILBERTS



MACADAMIAS



PEANUTS



PECANS



OTHER NUTS



WALNUTS







Nuts grow & mature at different times throughout the year.
NUT HARVEST TIMELINE




Since nuts are an agricultural product, they are susceptible to natural occurrences such as droughts or cold weather. Variations in the tonnage of nuts available to harvest have an impact on their price. Using the Nut Harvest Timeline, we closely monitor the progress of every nut from the time of its gestation to harvest. This helps us plan and procure the best product to process and meet the requirements of our diverse customer base.

John B. Sanfilippo and Son, Inc. Voluntarily Recalls Fisher Peanuts Dry Roasted Golden Roast Product Due to Undeclared Wheat Ingredient | Business Wire
























































John B. Sanfilippo and Son, Inc. Voluntarily Recalls Fisher Peanuts 
      Dry Roasted Golden Roast Product Due to Undeclared Wheat Ingredient






March 20, 2014 04:37 PM Eastern Daylight Time



ELGIN, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--John B. Sanfilippo and Son, Inc. (JBSS) announced today that it is 
      voluntarily recalling one best by date code of product labeled as Fisher 
      Peanuts Dry Roasted Golden Roast because this product contains dry 
      roasted honey roasted peanuts. This recall arose as a result of consumer 
      notifications pertaining to incorrect labeling. Dry roasted honey 
      roasted peanuts contain a wheat ingredient, which is an allergen, and 
      certain other non-allergenic ingredients that are not declared on the 
      Fisher dry roasted peanut label. Consumers who are allergic to wheat 
      ingredients may run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic 
      reactions if they consume this product.
    

      To date, JBSS has not received any reports of illnesses in connection 
      with the item listed below.
    

      Consumers who have purchased the item listed below at Menards, Inc. 
      stores located in IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, MI, MN, MO, ND, NE, OH, SD, WI and 
      WY should not consume this product and should return it to the store of 
      purchase for a full refund or replacement.
