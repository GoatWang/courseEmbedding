Our services







Description

              If you provide our customer service representatives with feedback on your experiences with our products/services or otherwise submit questions to our customer service representatives or webmasters, you will be asked to supply personal information for our record keeping and follow-up.NRG will not collect any personal information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. We may ask you to provide information including your name, address, government-issued identification card number, social security number, telephone number, and email address. In addition, we may ask you to provide information relating to energy use, such as the characteristics of your home, your age, gender and family size, or we may ask you to state your opinion about potential products and services.As lack of confidence in the grid coincides with the introduction of new technologies, businesses and homeowners will realize that there is a better way. And, for them, that means generating most of the electricity they consume on the premises, from their own resources. In this new reality, our 'mass' retail electricity franchise, consisting of Reliant, Green Mountain and NRG itself, becomes ever more important. Our retail focus is on ensuring that we remain a first mover in bringing technological innovation aimed at the home energy consumer to our customers, on terms that they find attractive.NRG's primary goal in collecting information is to allow us to offer products and services which are relevant to consumers like you. Personal information also allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience smooth and efficient. Any personal information that we collect will only be used for internal marketing purposes of NRG, except as otherwise required by law or as disclosed to you in this Privacy Statement.And for the customer, business or individual, who simply wants nothing to do with the grid, the centralized control it represents and the inhibition of individual choice and restriction of personal freedom that is implicit in being 'intertied' to the grid, there is the post-grid future – a future that is driven by renewables, incorporating both energy storage and sophisticated localized automation to balance production and load.
