Our Roots
Our roots stem back more than twenty five years when Columbia Pacific Management (CPM) was founded by Daniel Baty. Throughout its existence CPM has delivered compelling investment results. In 2006, Columbia Pacific Management launched Columbia Pacific Advisors (CPA), an alternative investment platform specifically for the Baty family and a select number of outside investors.
Tapping into this proven experience, CPM and CPA saw a void in high net worth investing and formed Columbia Pacific Wealth Management (CPWM) in 2011. Columbia Pacific assembled a team of highly experienced professionals to create a comprehensive wealth management firm with a boutique feel. Building on its success, in 2015 CPWM acquired the Kibble & Prentice Private Investment Advisory Group, a talented wealth management team with experience spanning more than three decades.
