Revlon Fact Sheet


HISTORY

Revlon was founded in 1932, by Charles Revson and his brother Joseph, along with a chemist, Charles Lachman, who contributed the "L" in the REVLON name. Starting with a single product - a nail enamel unlike any before it - the three founders pooled their meager resources and developed a unique manufacturing process.

ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

Environmental Indicator 
            Status:
Human Exposures Under Control [PDF 69.11 KB, 21 pp] has been verified.
Groundwater Contamination Under Control [PDF 70.39 KB, 
            21 pp] has been verified.



Site Description
The Revlon Incorporated (Revlon) Main Production Facility, formerly  owned by Johnson and Johnson, operated at 55 Talmadge Road, on a 63.2-acre  property in Edison, New Jersey from 1956 to 1999. Revlon manufactured lipstick,  dusting powder, fragrances, toiletries, nail enamel, other make-up and their  packaging at the facility. The company stored its cosmetic products (prior to  packaging) in several underground and above-ground storage tanks on-site. 

      In 1985, when Revlon entered into a merger agreement for the  Edison site with Nicole Acquisition Company, an environmental evaluation of the  site was performed as required under the New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection (NJDEP) State Property Transfer Program. The facility was sold to  Starwood Heller, L.L.C., in 1999, and changed its name to Revlon Consumer Products  Corporation.  The property is currently owned by Morris Route 27  Associates and Morris Route 27 Development Associates. 
Potential Threats and Contaminants
The environmental investigation performed at the time of the  merger revealed that some underground and above-ground tanks leaked their  contents into the soil and, eventually, into the groundwater under the site.  The soil and groundwater were contaminated  with organic compounds including trichloroethylene, trichloroethane, acetone  and 1,2-dichloroethene.
Cleanup Approach and Progress
The facility is being cleaned up under  the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) State Property  Transfer Program. Revlon excavated and properly disposed-of contaminated soil  from several areas. Two areas of sub-surface soil contamination, along the  northwestern side of the Revlon property, are covered with asphalt to prevent  potential contact with the contaminants and to minimize the infiltration of  water. The remedy also includes a deed notice. The area is secured by  fencing.  

      A system of wells was installed and expanded in the area of the groundwater  contamination to remove the contaminants. This is done by pumping the  groundwater out of the ground and removing the chemicals with air strippers and  carbon filters. The treated groundwater is then discharged to the Middlesex  County Utilities Authority treatment works. The groundwater system is  maintaining hydraulic control of the groundwater. 

      Organic compounds were detected in indoor air samples at the location of the  former manufacturing building and have been attributed to potential background  interferences from furniture and carpet.  Indoor air sampling conducted  off-site has not detected any compounds related to Revlon. A new warehouse  building is planned in the central portion of the property and will be constructed  with a vapor control system.

      Groundwater monitoring is being conducted and additional groundwater remedial  system enhancements are being implemented to more effectively cleanup the  groundwater. A network of additional wells was installed to add components to  the groundwater to further dissolve contaminants. Groundwater treatment will  continue until applicable standards have been achieved.
Final Cleanup Status or Projection

Final Remedy Construction (RCRAInfo database code CA550) has been achieved.

        Protection Agency's (EPA's) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) 
        program deals with solid waste (e.g., garbage), hazardous waste, and underground 
        storage tanks. The RCRA regulations are intended to ensure proper operation 
        of solid waste landfills and underground storage tank systems, cleanup 
        of certain hazardous waste sites, and safe operation of facilities that 
        generate, treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste. EPA's Region 2 Superfund program also deals with cleanup of hazardous sites.
