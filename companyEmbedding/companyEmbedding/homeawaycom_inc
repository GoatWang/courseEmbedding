HomeAway moved into its new global headquarters in Austin, Texas on October 2, 2009; it was the first mixed-use project and the second company in Austin to achieve LEED Gold certification for Commercial Interior Design.[25]
In 2009, Us Weekly magazine announced that HomeAway would reunite actors Chevy Chase and Beverly D’Angelo in a new short film and advertising campaign based on National Lampoon’s Vacation (a movie). The HomeAway ad represents the company’s first national advertising campaign. It debuted during the CBS television network broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV on February 7, 2010.[26]
HomeAway raised a total of $405 million in venture-capital which was funded by venture capital firms Austin Ventures, Institutional Venture Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Technology Crossover Ventures and Trident Capital.[27] Homeaway’s IPO stock closed at $40.21 on Nasdaq, up 48.9% from its IPO price of $27.
In 2014, the company announced that through an all-cash transaction, it acquired the U.S. mobile application ‘Glad to Have You’ (GLAD).[28][29][30] Glad’s mobile apps gave vacation rental companies, hotels, and resorts a way to communicate and keep track of guests during their stay. Glad also provided guests with necessary information prior to checking in as well as a local venue recommendation service to enhance their experience.
In 2015, HomeAway invested $4.9 million[31] in CanadaStays to increase the number of Canadian properties from less than 10,000 to more than 220,000.[32] The investment makes HomeAway a minority stakeholder in CanadaStays, which is the largest vacation rental site in Canada and based in Toronto.[33]
In 2015, Homeaway also invested $2 million[34] in the leading Turkish vacation rental marketplace Flat4Day (locally known as Hemenkiralik) to add 45,000 properties from the EMEA region. The partnership makes Homeaway a minority shareholder in the Istanbul-based company, who is the largest vacation rental network in EMEA.

Business model[edit]
Before HomeAway introduced its new optional performance-based business model in 2013, homeowners paid subscription fees which averaged out to be $442 annually, to list their own property or display their vacation rentals on the company’s sites.[38] To promote the vacation rentals, property owners and managers could purchase paid listings on one or more of the company's websites as a form of advertising to potential travelers. Paid listings appear in search results when travelers search for vacation rentals, based on their search criteria. The new performance-based model represented a second option for those wishing to list a home on HomeAway, who could still opt for the original annual subscription model.
In 2016, HomeAway introduced a controversial service fee paid by the traveler when booking through the HomeAway websites. The fee varies from 4 to 10 percent of the rental cost, and is capped at $499. The company claims the fee covers the cost of providing 24/7 customer support, enhanced site and mobile features for both owner and travelers, plus expanded marketing efforts to generate more exposure to global audiences.
Simultaneous with the service fee’s introduction, HomeAway instituted a Book with Confidence Guarantee for travelers who opt to book and pay through HomeAway. [39]
Also in 2016, the company eliminated its tiered subscription model, whereby owners and property managers could pay for placement in search results, and instituted an annual subscription option to complement a pay-per-booking option that adds eight percent of the quoted total rental fee to the cost of each booking. [40]
HomeAway also introduced a Professional Referral Network of 40 partner companies. The network’s members assist vacation rental owners in managing their listings, guest inquiries and reservations, and include Evolve Vacation Rental Network, Southern California Vacation Rentals and No Worries Vacation Rentals.
Financing[edit]
HomeAway announced in November 2006 its $160 million in financing to fund global expansion initiatives, including the acquisition of VRBO.com (Vacation Rentals by Owner).[27] On November 11, 2008, HomeAway announced it had completed an additional $250 million equity capital raise.[41] The investment was led by Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV) and with existing investors Austin Ventures, Institutional Venture Partners (IVP) and Redpoint Ventures.[42] In 2010, the Wall Street Journal named HomeAway one of the top 10 venture funded companies.[43]
Legal status[edit]
HomeAway has had disputes over compliance with local lodging regulations, similar to competitor Airbnb. Both joined a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco, which was settled in May 2017 when the companies agreed to facilitate registration of all host listings with the city.[44]

HomeAway moved into its new global headquarters in Austin, Texas on October 2, 2009; it was the first mixed-use project and the second company in Austin to achieve LEED Gold certification for Commercial Interior Design.[25]
In 2009, Us Weekly magazine announced that HomeAway would reunite actors Chevy Chase and Beverly D’Angelo in a new short film and advertising campaign based on National Lampoon’s Vacation (a movie). The HomeAway ad represents the company’s first national advertising campaign. It debuted during the CBS television network broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV on February 7, 2010.[26]
HomeAway raised a total of $405 million in venture-capital which was funded by venture capital firms Austin Ventures, Institutional Venture Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Technology Crossover Ventures and Trident Capital.[27] Homeaway’s IPO stock closed at $40.21 on Nasdaq, up 48.9% from its IPO price of $27.
In 2014, the company announced that through an all-cash transaction, it acquired the U.S. mobile application ‘Glad to Have You’ (GLAD).[28][29][30] Glad’s mobile apps gave vacation rental companies, hotels, and resorts a way to communicate and keep track of guests during their stay. Glad also provided guests with necessary information prior to checking in as well as a local venue recommendation service to enhance their experience.
In 2015, HomeAway invested $4.9 million[31] in CanadaStays to increase the number of Canadian properties from less than 10,000 to more than 220,000.[32] The investment makes HomeAway a minority stakeholder in CanadaStays, which is the largest vacation rental site in Canada and based in Toronto.[33]
In 2015, Homeaway also invested $2 million[34] in the leading Turkish vacation rental marketplace Flat4Day (locally known as Hemenkiralik) to add 45,000 properties from the EMEA region. The partnership makes Homeaway a minority shareholder in the Istanbul-based company, who is the largest vacation rental network in EMEA.

Business model[edit]
Before HomeAway introduced its new optional performance-based business model in 2013, homeowners paid subscription fees which averaged out to be $442 annually, to list their own property or display their vacation rentals on the company’s sites.[38] To promote the vacation rentals, property owners and managers could purchase paid listings on one or more of the company's websites as a form of advertising to potential travelers. Paid listings appear in search results when travelers search for vacation rentals, based on their search criteria. The new performance-based model represented a second option for those wishing to list a home on HomeAway, who could still opt for the original annual subscription model.
In 2016, HomeAway introduced a controversial service fee paid by the traveler when booking through the HomeAway websites. The fee varies from 4 to 10 percent of the rental cost, and is capped at $499. The company claims the fee covers the cost of providing 24/7 customer support, enhanced site and mobile features for both owner and travelers, plus expanded marketing efforts to generate more exposure to global audiences.
Simultaneous with the service fee’s introduction, HomeAway instituted a Book with Confidence Guarantee for travelers who opt to book and pay through HomeAway. [39]
Also in 2016, the company eliminated its tiered subscription model, whereby owners and property managers could pay for placement in search results, and instituted an annual subscription option to complement a pay-per-booking option that adds eight percent of the quoted total rental fee to the cost of each booking. [40]
HomeAway also introduced a Professional Referral Network of 40 partner companies. The network’s members assist vacation rental owners in managing their listings, guest inquiries and reservations, and include Evolve Vacation Rental Network, Southern California Vacation Rentals and No Worries Vacation Rentals.
Financing[edit]
HomeAway announced in November 2006 its $160 million in financing to fund global expansion initiatives, including the acquisition of VRBO.com (Vacation Rentals by Owner).[27] On November 11, 2008, HomeAway announced it had completed an additional $250 million equity capital raise.[41] The investment was led by Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV) and with existing investors Austin Ventures, Institutional Venture Partners (IVP) and Redpoint Ventures.[42] In 2010, the Wall Street Journal named HomeAway one of the top 10 venture funded companies.[43]
Legal status[edit]
HomeAway has had disputes over compliance with local lodging regulations, similar to competitor Airbnb. Both joined a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco, which was settled in May 2017 when the companies agreed to facilitate registration of all host listings with the city.[44]

HomeAway moved into its new global headquarters in Austin, Texas on October 2, 2009; it was the first mixed-use project and the second company in Austin to achieve LEED Gold certification for Commercial Interior Design.[25]
In 2009, Us Weekly magazine announced that HomeAway would reunite actors Chevy Chase and Beverly D’Angelo in a new short film and advertising campaign based on National Lampoon’s Vacation (a movie). The HomeAway ad represents the company’s first national advertising campaign. It debuted during the CBS television network broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV on February 7, 2010.[26]
HomeAway raised a total of $405 million in venture-capital which was funded by venture capital firms Austin Ventures, Institutional Venture Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Technology Crossover Ventures and Trident Capital.[27] Homeaway’s IPO stock closed at $40.21 on Nasdaq, up 48.9% from its IPO price of $27.
In 2014, the company announced that through an all-cash transaction, it acquired the U.S. mobile application ‘Glad to Have You’ (GLAD).[28][29][30] Glad’s mobile apps gave vacation rental companies, hotels, and resorts a way to communicate and keep track of guests during their stay. Glad also provided guests with necessary information prior to checking in as well as a local venue recommendation service to enhance their experience.
In 2015, HomeAway invested $4.9 million[31] in CanadaStays to increase the number of Canadian properties from less than 10,000 to more than 220,000.[32] The investment makes HomeAway a minority stakeholder in CanadaStays, which is the largest vacation rental site in Canada and based in Toronto.[33]
In 2015, Homeaway also invested $2 million[34] in the leading Turkish vacation rental marketplace Flat4Day (locally known as Hemenkiralik) to add 45,000 properties from the EMEA region. The partnership makes Homeaway a minority shareholder in the Istanbul-based company, who is the largest vacation rental network in EMEA.

Business model[edit]
Before HomeAway introduced its new optional performance-based business model in 2013, homeowners paid subscription fees which averaged out to be $442 annually, to list their own property or display their vacation rentals on the company’s sites.[38] To promote the vacation rentals, property owners and managers could purchase paid listings on one or more of the company's websites as a form of advertising to potential travelers. Paid listings appear in search results when travelers search for vacation rentals, based on their search criteria. The new performance-based model represented a second option for those wishing to list a home on HomeAway, who could still opt for the original annual subscription model.
In 2016, HomeAway introduced a controversial service fee paid by the traveler when booking through the HomeAway websites. The fee varies from 4 to 10 percent of the rental cost, and is capped at $499. The company claims the fee covers the cost of providing 24/7 customer support, enhanced site and mobile features for both owner and travelers, plus expanded marketing efforts to generate more exposure to global audiences.
Simultaneous with the service fee’s introduction, HomeAway instituted a Book with Confidence Guarantee for travelers who opt to book and pay through HomeAway. [39]
Also in 2016, the company eliminated its tiered subscription model, whereby owners and property managers could pay for placement in search results, and instituted an annual subscription option to complement a pay-per-booking option that adds eight percent of the quoted total rental fee to the cost of each booking. [40]
HomeAway also introduced a Professional Referral Network of 40 partner companies. The network’s members assist vacation rental owners in managing their listings, guest inquiries and reservations, and include Evolve Vacation Rental Network, Southern California Vacation Rentals and No Worries Vacation Rentals.
Financing[edit]
HomeAway announced in November 2006 its $160 million in financing to fund global expansion initiatives, including the acquisition of VRBO.com (Vacation Rentals by Owner).[27] On November 11, 2008, HomeAway announced it had completed an additional $250 million equity capital raise.[41] The investment was led by Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV) and with existing investors Austin Ventures, Institutional Venture Partners (IVP) and Redpoint Ventures.[42] In 2010, the Wall Street Journal named HomeAway one of the top 10 venture funded companies.[43]
Legal status[edit]
HomeAway has had disputes over compliance with local lodging regulations, similar to competitor Airbnb. Both joined a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco, which was settled in May 2017 when the companies agreed to facilitate registration of all host listings with the city.[44]

August Home Inc Partners with HomeAway, Inc to Deliver Simple Secure Access Via Smart Keypad Pin Code
Apr 18 17
August Home Inc. is partnering HomeAway Inc. Now it’s easier for hosts to give guests secure, keyless access to their listing using an August Smart Lock and August Smart Keypad. After making a reservation for a vacation rental with August Home products, HomeAway guests automatically receive a secure PIN code for their stay through the HomeAway app they used to make their reservation there’s nothing else for them to do or download. The vacation rental market continues to grow, fueled by tech innovation including smart home technology, which delivers a better, more secure and convenient experience for both hosts and guests, according to the August Home study, Short-term Rentals: Smarter Hosting with Smart Home Technology. Guests indicate not worrying about being locked out (53%), not having to coordinate with hosts when arriving or departing a property (48%), providing an easier system for checking-in and checking-out (46%) and a carefree, key-free stay would make the rental experience less stressful for them. For hosts, stress-relievers include not having to worry about guests forgetting to lock the door (66%) and no more hiding keys where someone besides the guest might find them (34%). Any reservation changes or cancellations automatically change the access times and days for the property. These changes are also reflected inside the HomeAway Traveler app and HomeAway Owner Dashboard. Once the reservation ends, access to the property automatically ends. Providing secure PIN code access to a property with an August Smart Keypad requires an August Smart Lock. Remotely provisioning a Smart Keypad PIN code requires the August Connect Wi-Fi Bridge.


HomeAway Faces Lawsuit over Alleged Trademark Infringement
Feb 19 16
Omni Hotels Management Corp. is suing HomeAway Inc. for alleged trademark violation. In the suit, filed on February 17, 2016 in the federal Northern District of Texas court, Dallas-based Omni argues that some listings on the company’s website infringe on trademarks for its La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California and for the Rancho Las Palmas Resort and Spa in Rancho Mirage, California, as well as for the Omni brand in general. In the suit, Omni highlights several vacation rentals on the company’s site that either mention their proximity to or location within those resorts or include photographs that depict resort signage or logos.
