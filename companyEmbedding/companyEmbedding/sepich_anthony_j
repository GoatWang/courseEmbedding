Joseph A. "Joe" Sepich, 75, of Decatur, died at 10:25 a.m. Sunday, November 6, 2011 in St. Mary's Hospital. Mr. Sepich was born June 6, 1936 in Canton, son of Joseph A. and Virginia (Urbanc) Sepich, Sr. A native of Canton, Joe graduated from SIU Carbondale with a Bachelors Degree in vocational education. He worked his way through college as a draftsman and moved to Decatur in 1962 when he accepted a teaching position. As a teacher Joe was instrumental in developing the Decatur Area Vocational Center and taught drafting at Richland Community College from 1972 to 1978. Joe also worked at Marvel-Schebler/Tillotson Division, Borg-Warner Corp; Mueller Co; and along with his wife owned and operated Molly Maid of Decatur. Joe was a member of St. Patrick Catholic Church, Very Reverend Jeremiah J. Murphy Assembly #211, K of C Council #577, and Royal Arcanum. He married Myra L. Mitchell July 6, 1963 in Decatur. He is survived by his wife, Myra of Decatur; children: Virginia L. Sepich of St. Louis, MO, Anita J. (Craig) Olson of Decatur, Sarah F. (Bryan) Hosler of Villa Grove, Anthony J.

Dear Mrs. Sepich, Virgina & Family,   My sympathies go out to each of you.  My hope and prayer for you all is that peace surround each of you as family gathers to share this time and the memories of times past.   I recall giving your dad grief in the hallways of St. Marys as he was coming or going from the chapel for adoration about all his Chicago Cub stuff and as only he could growl auh get out  I recall many times in school and church events throughout the years, Boy Scout Roses on Mothers Day and reciting the Rosary in Church.  We attended a White house retreat once together in late summer in the mid 80s.  Mr. Sepich was a man of deep faith that was shared with all those around him. May that same faith give each of you the confidence in knowing he no longer has any aches or pains and is in the Heavenly Choir before the Most High Alter of God.       Peace, Dan Ballance

I was not blessed to know Joseph, but blessed to know his son Anthony. My experience has been (within the dynamics of a family) a first born son is nearest the image of the father. That being said, I am able to imagine that Joseph was a man of the greatest caliber. One of my greatest reflections is time spent at Saint Teresa, years that I was closest to Anthony.

I was not blessed to know Joseph, but blessed to know his son Anthony.  My experience has been (within the dynamics of a family) a first born son is nearest the image of the father. That being said, I am able to imagine that Joseph was a man of the greatest caliber. One of my greatest reflections is time spent at Saint Teresa, years that I was closest to Anthony. With God's blessing of hindsight, I believe Anthony was little more than a vessel of Joseph's moral and spiritual fiber (the 4 cardinal virtues being the greatest). God's great "Revealer" (time) blesses Anthony to take ownership of the attributes that his father passed through/to him, and now Anthony passes them on through all who come in contact with him (most evident through his children). Joseph now spends eternity in bliss that we are unable to comprehend. He smiles down on us as he watches God’s Plan unravel for each, and the day that God allows us to join him in that state of bliss.
