Last updated: 30 June 2017.


The Magellan High Conviction Fund seeks to invest in outstanding companies at attractive prices, while exercising a deep understanding of the macroeconomic environment to manage investment risk.                                                                      
Magellan perceives outstanding companies to be those that are able to sustainably exploit competitive advantages in order to continually earn returns on capital that are materially in excess of their cost of capital.
While Magellan is extremely focused on fundamental business value, it is not a typical ’value’ investor. The Magellan High Conviction Fund will invest in companies that have relatively high price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples, provided that their businesses are outstanding and their shares are trading at an appropriate discount to their assessed intrinsic value. Equities that appear undervalued on the basis of a low price-to-earnings or price-to-book multiples will often prove to be poor investments if the underlying business is fundamentally weak and exhibits poor returns on capital.
Magellan focuses on risk-adjusted returns, rather than benchmark-relative returns. As a result, the Magellan High Conviction Fund’s investment process is designed to generate an unconstrained, highly-concentrated portfolio of high-quality companies.
The Magellan High Conviction Fund’s will comprise of 8 to 12 investments, with the portfolio weighted towards Magellan’s highest-conviction ideas. The Fund may also hedge some, or all, of the capital component of its foreign currency exposure arising from investments in overseas markets back to Australian dollars. 


The Magellan High Conviction Fund leverages off the Magellan Global Fund’s investment process, which integrates three key disciplines:

Intensive bottom-up stock analysis and industry research.
Broad and detailed macroeconomic insight.
Rigorous portfolio construction and risk discipline.

Intensive bottom-up stock analysis and industry research is undertaken in order to identify outstanding companies. This involves the assessment of potential investments against key quality criteria, as well as assessments of their intrinsic value. Magellan uses a proprietary ranking tool, the Magellan Conviction Scoring Matrix, to rank these companies based on these factors. This process enables the portfolio to be weighted towards higher conviction ideas (on a risk-adjusted basis).
Magellan’s detailed macroeconomic analysis is overlayed during portfolio construction, alongside the application of both fixed and dynamic risk limits. This process ensures that the portfolio is not overly exposed to aggregation risk (risk which arises from correlated portfolio positions) or macroeconomic event risk. Macroeconomic event risk can be a significant source of negative returns for investors. Magellan will make significant changes to the portfolio if it believes that macroeconomic events could lead to significant and sustained loss in value for investors. Such events would include a financial crisis, a sustained oil price shock, a global pandemic or a major global conflict.
