Specialty Technologies
Mayne Pharma’s oral drug delivery technology experience has been established across a number of therapeutic classes. Through specialist material science skills, processes and proprietary technologies, clients are provided with products that have developmental, regulatory and marketing exclusivity.
Mayne Pharma’s oral drug delivery technologies and skills can be applied to reformulate solid oral dose forms of branded prescription products, generic prescription products, branded over the counter products and value added active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Proprietary pharmaceutical technologies include:

Customized controlled-release drug delivery
Bioavailability enhancement 
Taste masking (liquid and solid presentations)

Through our collaboration with our commercial partners, these technologies are utilized to develop and distribute novel prescription and OTC products which offer advantages over existing products, in order to meet unmet medical needs.
When applied appropriately, these technologies can potentially deliver the following therapeutic and convenience benefits to patients:

Reduced dosing frequency
Increased patient compliance
Improved side effect profile
More constant therapeutic effect

Benefits of Improved Drug Delivery:
Improving clinical outcomes & maximizing returns
Drug reformulation of existing molecules plays a key role in improving patient compliance and improving clinical outcomes. It also enables a molecule’s full commercial potential to be recognized. As such it is vital in maximizing returns on investment.
Key objectives of drug reformulation include:

Extending the scope of the drug (i.e. indication, routes of administration)
Improving efficacy
Improving ease of administration
Extending patent life
Improving the product’s competitive profile 

Revitalizing your Product
Drug reformulation reveals a number of marketing opportunities at different stages of the product lifecycle that help to achieve strategic goals. Employing Mayne Pharma’s proprietary technology to manage the product life cycle may allow opportunities for new regulatory exclusivity and intellectual property, and hence extend the period of marketing exclusivity for the product while providing additional patient benefits.
Product lifecycle opportunities include:

Increased commercial potential of a molecule is enabled through expanding the scope (i.e. new indications, accessing new segments of patient populations).
New sales opportunities enabled by new and differentiated formulations.
Extended patent protection for a competitively differentiated formulation.
Reformulation of an off patent drug to capture market share and/or grow the market for the drug.

Maximizing returns on new chemical entities (NCE)
Many NCEs fail to reach the market as an oral dose form due to inadequate physicochemical or biopharmaceutical properties (e.g. high variability and/or low absorption, short half life etc). This results in candidate failure or development of the NCE in a less preferred route.
Such deficiencies may be addressed with the application of Mayne Pharma’s drug delivery technologies, which can help to diminish such inadequacies, formulate a NCE into a preferred route and allow for NCE optimization.

US Compliance Notices
California Annual Declaration of Compliance
Mayne Pharma (“Mayne”) has adopted a Comprehensive Compliance Program in accordance with California Health and Safety Code, § 119402. Mayne’s Comprehensive Compliance Program is in accordance with the April 2003 “Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers” developed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) and incorporates policies that comply with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America “Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals” as revised from time to time.
Mayne is committed to ensuring compliance with its company policies and with applicable laws and regulations. The Comprehensive Compliance Program represents Mayne’s commitment to the highest standards of corporate conduct. The OIG Guidance acknowledges that the implementation of a compliance program, such as the Comprehensive Compliance Program, cannot ensure that improper employee conduct will never occur. Nonetheless, Mayne expects and requires its employees to abide by Mayne’s Business Code of Conduct and the other policies described in its Comprehensive Compliance Program.
Mayne declares, to the best of its knowledge and based on its good faith understanding of the statutory requirements that Mayne is in compliance with Comprehensive Compliance Program and Chapter 8, Part 15, Division 104 of the California Health and Safety Code.
Mayne has set the annual aggregate limit on covered promotional expenditures at $1,500 per covered medical or healthcare professional for annual periods commencing on July 1, 2015. This limit may be revised by Mayne from time to time. The foregoing limit does not represent any usual, customary, average, or typical amount for medical or health care professionals.
This program became effective as of July 1, 2015.
Mayne will assess its Comprehensive Compliance Program at least annually.
A copy of the Comprehensive Compliance Program may be obtained by calling (in the U.S.) +1 984 242 1397 or by downloading the file Comprehensive Compliance Program.

Partnering
One of the keys to Mayne Pharma’s success has been the implementation of strategic partnerships and alliances and a flexible and pragmatic approach to licensing and acquisitions. These are fundamental to the company’s continued growth and success.
Our strategy is to develop our business by licensing and acquiring products that we are able to market throughout the Asia Pacific region and to develop partnerships for the global marketing of products developed by Mayne Pharma.
As a partner, Mayne Pharma offers:
•  An expanding sales and marketing capability to bring new brands into the Australian market •  A management team and corporate culture committed to partnering  •  A proven product development, manufacturing, quality, regulatory and supply chain logistics capability  •  A flexible and creative approach to collaborations  •  The ability to respond rapidly to opportunities  •  A track record of successful partnering (some of our current partners include Warner Chilcott, Pfizer, GSK, Abbott, Meda and Cephalon)
Our Corporate and Business Development Department is a team of business development and alliance management experts who oversee the selection and review of in-licensing and acquisition opportunities, manage the out-licensing process and actively pursue strategic alliances, to build strong relationships that are mutually beneficial to all parties.
In-licensing/acquisitions
Mayne Pharma is seeking to rapidly expand its product portfolio in Australia. Our business development activities are focused on prescription and OTC products that are in late-stage development, currently approved and commercialised outside Australia, or approved in Australia but falling outside the license holder’s business focus. We will consider in-licensing, acquisition, co-promotion, revenue-sharing, and other partnering opportunities. We are focused primarily on oral, topical (including transdermal) dosage form products (NCEs, ICEs or niche/branded generics).  Therapeutic categories of primary interest include pain management, infectious disease, cardiology and ophthalmology, although we will consider other opportunities outside of these areas.
Out-licensing
Mayne Pharma is working to expand its global strategic marketing partnerships for products developed-in house (see Partners, Opportunities and Partially Developed Products). Mayne Pharma products typically incorporate proprietary drug delivery technology offering a therapeutic benefit.  Mayne Pharma aims to provide patent protection for its products and we work closely with our partners to ensure that an effective life-cycle management strategy is in place.
Services

Through the integration of Mayne Pharma’s proprietary technologies, manufacturing capabilities and intimate knowledge of product markets, customers are provided with tailored pharmaceutical solutions.

Product Development
Mayne Pharma has a proven track record in the development, optimisation and scale-up of generic and branded, innovative products for over the counter and prescription purchase. In addition we also provide value added active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with off-patent drugs or new chemical entities (NCEs) for local and international markets. 
Mayne Pharma offers product development options in conjunction with associated services, via its product development facility which is comprised of analytical laboratories and pilot scale production facilities that allow for a continuous scale up pathway from bench scale formulation to full commercial manufacture. 
All facilities have been approved by international regulatory authorities including TGA, FDA, TPD and MHRA. Furthermore Mayne Pharma meets GMP and GLP standards for clinical supplies, thus accrediting our company to fulfill your requirements to ensure your products meet international standards.  Mayne Pharma has experience shipping product, including clinical trial supplies, to any location in the world.
