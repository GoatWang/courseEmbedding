The ICBCH
Contextual Hypnotherapy 
Certificate of Achievement Program
With Roger Moore and Richard and Alex Nongard

To be an effective hypnotherapist requires a firm foundation. Contextual Hypnotherapy is based on the foundation of research backed methods for change. This course, Contextual Hypnotherapy with Richard Nongard and Roger Moore, is for anyone seeking modern-day cutting edge hypnosis training. 
Contextual hypnotherapy is an easy approach to learn, but the results are far from ordinary. It is helping clients on a unique level by teaching the skills to maximize their own resilient resources and draws heavily from current research in the areas of Positive Psychology, ACT Therapy, Solutions Focused Brief Therapy and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy.
The idea of applying contextual approaches to hypnosis may be new, but the methods have been well established in the areas pain control, anxiety management, and helping people in crisis.
 Contextual hypnotherapy is not about regression or searching for cause. Contextual hypnotherapy is effective and it will free you and your clients from pursing the past by harnessing the power of now. It is about adapting to the past and building on both the known and unknown internal resources we hold. This course is an alternative to “looking for cause” and becoming stuck in the past.
You will learn the 5 stages of the hypnotic process from a contextual perspective:

Initial assessment and rapport
Induction
Deepeners
Suggestive Therapy
Re-orientation

You will learn the specific hypnotic techniques and methods of:

ACT Therapy
Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy
Positive Psychology
Solution Focused-Brief Therapy
Dialectical Behavioral Therapy

Most importantly, you will understand how these approaches can help you as a hypnotist and an effective helper, giving you the research and confidence to back that up.
You will learn methods of induction and suggestive therapy that actually teach unique and effective problem solving methods. Every aspect of the process, from induction to re-orientation has value and purpose. You will have confidence in the process, knowing that every client will leave each session with actionable strategies for maintaining change.
You will get:

12 online training videos
10 printable scripts for hypnotherapy based on Contextual approaches
9 Hours of CEU credit
A fancy printable and frame-worthy ICBCH Certificate of Achievement in full color
Skills you can use in brief sessions or full sessions
Strategies you can teach your client in person or via Skypenosis

This course is an online course which is self-paced. It uses the same learning modules and approach to online education that major universities use. You will have access to our online forums and groups and can interact with your instructors with any questions.
This course is appropriate for both experienced hypnotherapists and for those new to clinical hypnosis who are looking for an empirically based methodology without regression. Even if you have never taken a hypnosis training course before, you can benefit from this course.
The great thing about this course and the approach you will learn is that not only can you use these techniques to benefit others, you will apply each of these strategies in your own life as tools for self-discovery and personal transformation.

This course is sponsored by the ICBCH and Roger Moore’s Institute of Hypnotherapy
