Erin and Matt had a really amazing wedding day. We love their personalized details–sunglasses, cassette tapes, records—all made their wedding that much more special.
Here is what Erin had to say about her special day:
“Everything was really based on the feel of my dress. Romantic, a touch of vintage and really just things that we both really liked. We were also planning all details from New York where we live and we didn’t want to hire a florist so the look and feel all really came from things we could really do ourselves with friends and family.”

“Matt is a musician and I really wanted to be sure he had input into the details. He had some great ideas like the little 7” records as table stands and cassette tapes as escort cards. We bought Them on eBay and could tailor the tape to the person. His dad got Pink Floyd’s The Wall and one of my BFF’s got the Breakfast Club soundtrack. Everyone got to keep their tape. We also put matching sunglasses on each of the guests’ seats so the crowd had matching shades in our post-ceremony group shot.”

Advice for Future Brides
“I was dedicated to making things fun and really tried to let go of details that weren’t going to make or break the day. It’s possible that a bride could spend days and a lot of money on details that the guests would never notice. I stuck to my goals and had an amazing time: have a cute outfit, a yummy dinner and an awesome dance party. Also, try and implement details that will matter to your husband-to-be. It’s his day too!”

The table settings are absolutely charming! But the 45rpm records, cassette tapes, and shades are such fun added touches!

Erin & Matt’s Wedding
Posted November 26, 2012 by patrice & filed under Real Life Weddings.
 

Wedding Coordination: Arranged by Patrice
Blog Designed by: Mayra Concepcion of Wedding Ideas Now
Photography: Brandon Smith Photography
Floral Design: Panacea Flowery 
Catering: Epic Catering
Bakery: The Cakery
Music: AMS Entertainment
Venues: Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church | The Monarch Club
Bride and Groom: Erin and Matt
Erin’s engagement started with a hike in the local foothills and a surprise message that Matt had arranged for in advance.  This fairytale wedding on the Central Coast of California had a mix of elegance and simplicity and caught the attention of some national Blogs Style Unveiled.

This sign took loads of time to prepare.  I love that Matt let his romantic side come through and created this special moment for the two of them.  Not only that, Matt thought to bring his best man and photography pro, Brandon Smith, along to record the day!

The bride’s gown and personal details were stunning with mixes of diamonds, silver and lace.


 

Having a little fun with the guys!

The church decor was kept to a minimum, not only to save costs but to focus primarily on the wedding party and the splendor of the church itself.

The flowers by Panacea were understated brillance.  The pastels of the flowers and the gold and silver accents created a stunning reception.

A “sparkler” send-off is always fun and a great way to make a Grand Exit.

Erin and Matt having come full circle, enjoy their day.
Enjoy!

Glam Media Hires Top A-B InBev Digital Marketing Exec
Previously Chief Digital Officer at OMD, Erin Matts Had Been at Brewer for a Year


	By  

Cotton Delo.
	

	
	
 Published on February 15, 2012. 









Digital-media company Glam Media has hired Erin Matts, former global director-digital connections at Anheuser-Busch InBev, as chief digital marketing officer, a newly created position.





		Erin Matts, Glam Media 
 	


Glam Media, a network of       2,500 small and midsize publishers geared primarily toward women, is       widely expected to file for an IPO in the second quarter of       this year. Glam focuses on brand advertising and splits revenue down the middle with publisher partners.

Glam Media Will Test Investors' Appetite for Digital-Media IPOs






Ms. Matts describes her new post as focused on developing relationships with brands and Madison Avenue to communicate Glam's value beyond a distribution platform. She referred to custom-content integrations Glam's sales team can coordinate with site publishers on behalf of       clients.





"The success and growth [of       Glam] has been driven by       strong products," Ms. Matts said. "There's an opportunity for Glam to tell its story, and by       telling that       story to start to grow and expand in a really meaningful way."



She will ultimately be based out of       Glam's office in Brisbane, Calif., and report to President-General Manager, North America Jack       Rotolo. Though Ms. Matts role is       global, she noted that       she'll focus on the U.S. initially. Adding consumer advertising to her duties was a possibility down the road, she said.



Ms. Matts was previously chief digital officer at OMD but left in February 2011 to take her New York-based position at A-B InBev. Listing highlights of       her brief time there, she mentioned implementing a digital-leadership program, designed to draw attention to interesting learnings from across A-B InBev's global portfolio of       brands, as well as annual digital-leadership awards. She also pointed to in-market training aimed at teaching far-flung digital teams about what had worked in other markets.



"ABI is       still a young company as it relates to being a global entity; it's still only a few years old," Ms. Matts said. "For us to come together like that       and unite around what's really a global platform, which is       digital … there's so much energy around that      , and beer is       such a social product."



A-B InBev has not announced who will replace Ms. Matts.

ScanNCut: Cleaning Mats



As an impatient crafter I use a few different cutting mats with my ScanNCut® so I don't have to be slowed down by cleaning all the little bits off while I'm working. I'd much rather be crafting along then cleaning stuff (as you can tell by my inked up stamps, painted on stencils, etc. LOL!-) I just don't clean my art stuff unless it's necessary, and cutting mats are one of those necessities! Having a clean mat allows whatever material you are using to stick well to the mat so that it cuts cleanly without your material lifting off the mat and causing problems.

Well, I was organizing my new art studio the other day I was looking at my ScanNCut Mats and how desperately they need a good cleaning!  Now I'm sure you expert digital die-cut machine owners know how to keep your mats clean but for all you newbies I thought I'd pass on how I clean my mats....oh, and you experts, be sure to add any tips you have below in the comments! We'd love to learn from you too!!
Ok, so I start off by scraping all the bits off of my mat. I use an old credit card style hotel room key to get off paper or plastic pieces left behind on my mat.

Next I take an alcohol free baby wipe and gently work in a circular scrubbing motion over my mat, using new wipes as I need them. 

Ewww, it really gets the gunk off!
 
Lastly I let my mats dry for about 10 minutes before replacing the plastic protective cover back over them.  The stickiness on my mats is revitalized now that they're clean and I'm able to use them a lot longer if I keep them clean.
Are you a neat freek and clean your mats as you go? Do you have any tips for us? Leave your comments below!
