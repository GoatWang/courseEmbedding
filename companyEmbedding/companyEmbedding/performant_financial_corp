FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Commit To Purchase Performant Financial At $2.50, Earn 8% Annualized Using Options
Investors eyeing a purchase of Performant Financial Corp shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $3.25/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the October put at the $2.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 10 cents.

Short Interest Moves 22.7% Lower For PFMT
The most recent short interest data has been released by the NASDAQ for the 03/13/2015 settlement date, which shows a 311,951 share decrease in total short interest for Performant Financial Corp , to 1,064,075, a decrease of 22.67% since 02/27/2015. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

Leadership
Leading Performant with innovative solutions.















Lisa Im



Chief Executive Officer and Board Chair
As the CEO and Board Chair of Performant Financial Corporation, I am responsible for the growth of this business, satisfaction of our clients, excellence of this organization, and driving shareholder value.  Our goal is to innovate through technology, people and process to drive unparalleled value to clients above all competitors.  I have over 30 years of business experience including a leadership background in consumer product goods companies, Kraft and BestFoods, where consumers hire and fire companies and brands based on each experience.  Ultimately, the entire view of our brand boils down to each experience—we want every experience of the client or consumer to lead them back to us.  This is the kind of philosophy by which we go to market—clients and consumers choose us because we give them the best experience in the market.  We believe in driving success for our clients, excellence in our organization, innovating through technology, people, and process.  I am grateful to our clients who let us serve them as partners, and to our employees who bring their best to Performant every day.











Jeff Haughton



Chief Operating Officer
As the Chief Operating Officer, I am responsible for growing revenue and achieving operational excellence across our businesses.  Our objective is to provide best in class solutions that drive measurable value to our clients while strengthening their relationships with their customers.  We believe that innovating differentiated services across our client base will help us diversify and grow revenues with both current and new clients in existing and new markets.  We focus on enhancing our technology utilization to continually improve results and efficiency for our clients.  All of my work experience while at Goldman Sachs, and at FT Partners has centered on execution and delivering results which is our focus at Performant.  I’ve applied that experience to our objectives here at Performant since July of 2014.











Hakan Orvell



Chief Financial Officer
As the Chief Financial Officer, I oversee all of Performant’s accounting and financial reporting, financial planning and analysis, tax, treasury, and investor relations functions.  My background includes a variety of industries and various financial functions for companies who operate in both the US and internationally.  I joined the company in 2007 when it was private and played a key role in the IPO in 2012.  Since then, my focus also includes proficiency with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all aspects of our internal control systems, and actively being a part of an executive team whose goals are aligned to growing company value. My scope also includes identification of key risks and design of mitigating controls, documentation of principle procedures and performing pre-audit testing to evaluate existing compliance with all required standards.  And if that weren’t exciting enough, I have a great appreciation for the global diversity of people and cultures, and enjoy traveling to foreign countries when I’m not reading up on the latest SEC or accounting changes.











Hal Leach



Chief Compliance Officer and President of Performant Recovery
My role as Chief Compliance Officer is unique in that I was formerly the Chief Operating Officer.  As a result, I understand how important and intricate compliance is in all of the activities and processes of our business.  During my 35 years with Performant, I’ve focused on operations strategy and compliance management.  In over the three decades, as regulations have changed both at the Federal and state levels, my focus has been to ensure that our organization lives and breathes within those requirements. I am grateful that my deep experience gives me the chance to leverage synergies, engineer logistics, and provides compliance oversight to continuously improve operations across all products, services, and industries.











Simeon Kohl



Vice President and General Manager of Healthcare
Healthcare is an exciting growth avenue for Performant.  Performant’s healthcare services and products are differentiated through our integrity based analytics platform in which we design solutions that are unique to our clients. Our goal is to achieve long-term growth through alignment of the company’s program integrity assets to best serve our public and private sector healthcare clients. Healthcare is a newer and exciting growth avenue for Performant. We entered the healthcare market in 2005 with a demonstration project for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.  We then became one of the auditors of the first-ever nationwide Medicare Recovery Audit Contract.  In 2016, I became the head of Performant’s Healthcare initiatives and we re-engineered the organization to better facilitate our expansion into the commercial healthcare market where we can offer program integrity services to drive value to our commercial clients.  I joined Performant in 2012, and bring more than 20 years of executive management experience to our growth strategy. Most recently I led a company that provided integrity-based analytic solutions across a myriad of different industries.  I also have an extensive background in healthcare cost containment and related services including strategic direction and operational oversight to large healthcare audit and FWA engagements.
