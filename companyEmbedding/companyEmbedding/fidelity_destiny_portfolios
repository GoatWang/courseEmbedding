1Forbes rates funds separately in both up and down market cycles. Funds are rated against their peers and are awarded letter grades (A+ to F) based on peformance in bull and bear markets. Market cycles are defined by an index or blend of indices. Stock funds, for example, are rated and benchmarked over four bullish and bearish cycles using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. The peformance benchmark for Balanced funds is a 50/50 blended index of the S&P 500 and the Merrill Lynch corporate/government bond index. Most bond funds are rated for five years, with each month treated as either a bullish or bearish month. Exception: taxable junk bond funds, which are presently rated over a 12-year period corresponding to the three most recent market cycles of the Merrill Lynch high yield bond index. 2Annual expense ratio plus brokerage commissions paid by the fund for buying and selling securities. p: Prior year.

Two paths to a diversified portfolio
Here are two strategies to help you create a diversified portfolio that may be suited to your needs—risk-based model portfolios constructed for a hypothetical investor to use as inspiration, and single-fund strategies that we manage so you don’t have to do the research and rebalancing.
 Use our model portfolios to help generate ideas 
If you prefer to pick the funds you want in your portfolio, our model portfolios* show one way you might construct a well-diversified portfolio of Fidelity mutual funds based on your risk tolerance and financial situation. These combinations provide illustrations of potential opportunities for greater potential risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
How you invest starts with choosing an asset mix that is in line with your current circumstances and your short- and long-term goals. You can also find these, and other, model portfolios in our Planning & Guidance Center, which can help you determine the right mix for you. If you know your asset mix, you can select it below.

								  The primary objective of the Fidelity Fund Portfolios–Income is to provide a representation of just one way you might construct a portfolio of Fidelity mutual funds, designed for the purpose of providing a focus on interest and dividend income, over a range of long term risk levels, which are consistent with the asset allocations of a (sub)set of Fidelity’s Target Asset Mixes (TAMs). The Fidelity Fund Portfolios–Income represent three distinct income‐focused model portfolios (Conservative–Income, Balanced–Income, and Growth–Income) consistent with different levels of long-term risk.

          Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
	
    

          Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss.
	
    

          Investing involves risk, including risk of loss.
	
    

          Guidance provided by Fidelity through the Planning & Guidance Center is educational in nature, is not individualized, and is not intended to serve as the primary basis for your investment or tax-planning decisions.
	
    

          Fidelity's guidance is educational and should not be the primary basis of your investment decisions. Please see the model portfolio methodology (PDF) for more information about how the models are created. You should also carefully research any fund you may be considering prior to making an investment decision. You may consider another allocation and other investments, including non-Fidelity funds, having similar risk and return characteristics may be available. We suggest Fidelity Asset Manager and Fidelity Freedom funds for the one-fund strategies and funds only and other fund families may have other options available, including funds with different features and costs.
	
    

          We can change or update the model portfolios at any time. Fidelity will not notify you when they are updated. The model portfolios may contain taxable bond funds. The model portfolios do not attempt to consider the effect of income taxes on performance or returns and does not reflect any opinion on the tax-appropriateness of the portfolio for any investor. Depending on your tax situation, municipal bond funds may be more appropriate for you. Model portfolios do not consider the effect of taxes, fees and/or expenses associated with investing. Please consult with your investment or tax advisor, if applicable, prior to taking action.
	
    

          In applying the model portfolio or any other results to your individual situation, be sure to consider other assets, income and investments (e.g., home equity, savings accounts or other retirement accounts) in addition to assets designated for this goal. None of the strategies provided by this tool are designed to maximize return or predict the highest performing funds.

FIDELITY INVESTMENTS INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES COMPANY, INC.







CONTACT: Corporate Communications
(617) 563-5800
Fidelity Investments Institutional Services Company Inc.

Backgrounder
Established in 1979, Fidelity Investments Institutional Services Company, Inc. (FIIS) is a leading provider of investment products and services to financial institutions, including banks, insurance companies and broker/dealers. FIIS offers Fidelity Advisor Funds, Variable Insurance Product Funds (VIP), systematic investment plans, institutional money market funds, Advisor Retirement Connection 401(k) and IRA products, and the Advisor College Investing 529 Plan.

With nearly $169 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2002, FIIS is one of the largest providers of non-proprietary investment products in the intermediary marketplace. 

FIIS serves the broad institutional market in two distinct ways.  First, the company supplies investment products to financial intermediaries, who in turn sell these products to a wide range of investors.  Second, FIIS offers investment options and cash management services directly to corporations, and through capital markets divisions of banks. 

Recognizing the rapid and dramatic change taking place in the financial services industry, FIIS has implemented a distribution structure that is able to efficiently and effectively address the unique and changing business needs of its clients. The company works as a business partner with its intermediary clients, providing them with service and support at both the sales and home office levels.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

FIIS offers clients a distinctive array of investment products and programs, together with an exceptional level of service.  Those offerings are backed by the resources of the entire Fidelity organization, its highly regarded investment management performance, and its broad name recognition, all of which help FIIS provide its clients with the products and services they need to grow their businesses.

FIIS has developed a broad range of products, tools and resources designed specifically for financial advisors. Among these offerings are:

Fidelity Advisor Funds® Fidelity Advisor Funds is a family of 55 load mutual funds that are offered to investors exclusively through financial advisors. These funds present a complete offering of mutual funds with investment objectives to meet investor needs, ranging from growth to income to international and sector investing.

Variable Insurance Products Fund (VIP)  FIIS' Variable Insurance Product (VIP) Funds is a family of 18 portfolios that are offered exclusively to insurance companies as underlying investment options for inclusion within their variable annuity or variable life products. 

Fidelity Institutional Money Market Funds Fidelity Institutional Money Market (FIMM) Funds are available to FIIS' institutional and corporate clients. FIIS offers 6 FIMM Funds to meet a wide range of short-term cash management objectives.

Fidelity DestinySM Plans The DestinySM Plans, offered exclusively through financial advisors, are long-term systematic investment plans that allow investors to accumulate wealth by making regular monthly investments, for as little as $50, for minimum periods of 10 or 15 years. The Destiny Plans invest in one of two mutual funds, Fidelity Destiny Portfolios: Destiny I and Destiny II.
Offshore Products FIIS offers 14 offshore, Bermuda-based funds designed specifically for Latin America.  Offered exclusively through intermediaries, such as banks and broker/dealers with operations in Latin America, these funds are available only to investors who are neither U.S. citizens nor U.S. residents.
Advisor Retirement Connection Through the Advisor Retirement Connection, FIIS offers product and sales information on a variety of individual and group retirement programs, including 401(k), Rollover IRA, 403(b), SEP IRA, and SIMPLE IRA.
AdvisorXpress® AdvisorXpress is a password-protected Web site designed exclusively for financial advisors. It offers account access, trading, up-to-date product information, daily fund pricing, literature (download or order), online tools, fund manager commentary and a sales support system. 

AdvisorXchangeSM An innovative web-based program that enables financial services firms to import up-to-date content from AdvisorXpress to use on their own web sites.

The Right Moves® for Successful Retirement An innovative web-based program that enables financial services firms to import up-to-date content from AdvisorXpress to use on their own web sites.

Advisor College Investing Plan Sold exclusively through advisors, the Advisor College Investing Plan is a 529 college savings plan available to families nationwide.  The plan is offered by the State of New Hampshire and is managed by Fidelity Investments. It offers a variety of convenient features including payroll deduction and 10 individual fund portfolios.


FIIS product and service offerings are supported by an extensive client service network, which includes a large regionalized team of both external field representatives and internal phone representatives. The field representatives assist financial advisors in the development of effective selling strategies, client seminars, and needs-based marketing programs. The telephone staff handles incoming calls and makes outgoing calls to advisors, providing them with timely information on investment strategies and ideas to help meet their clients needs.

For more complete information on Fidelity funds, including fees and expenses, please call or write for a free prospectus.  Read it carefully before you invest or send money.

Variable insurance products are neither insured nor guaranteed by the FDIC.
