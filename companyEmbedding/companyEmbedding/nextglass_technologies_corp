The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling 
Shareholder Shares.


The Company would compete with traditional manufacturers and sellers of glass
products.


Company Description
The Company plans to produce and distribute glass products (which the Company
calls “smart glass” solutions). The Company intends to make these products based
on technology that is covered by patents that it acquired from SWIS Co.,
Limited. The patents covered consist of 9 patents. Eight of these


 patents are
registered in Korea, and one patent is registered in Taiwan.

The Company plans to make smart glass solutions for many types of applications,
including car windows, car sunroofs and airplane windows.

The Company’s smart glass solutions are expected to include adhesive film inside
the smart glass, bullet-proofing, non-scattering effects, noise reduction,
ITO-coated film, PDLC-coated Film and functional glass. The Company’s smart
glass solutions are intended to help users of the products control room
temperature and change the color and the amount of light passing through the
smart glass product.

On April 28, 2016, the Company agreed to acquire SWIS Co., Ltd., based in Korea.
SWIS Co. Ltd., holds as its principal asset a plant located in Seoul, Korea and
conducts operations through the company’s research and development department.
Although the transaction was agreed between the parties on April 28, 2016 under
Korean law, the change of ownership did not actually occur until August 10,
2016. On that date, August 10, 2016, the Korean government approved the
acquisition of the third party company, SWIS Co., Ltd., which was in connection
with the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) entered into on
April 28, 2016. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company purchased all
100,000 shares outstanding of SWIS Co., Ltd.

SWIS Co., Ltd. was established on September 2, 2014. Its major business is to
research and develop PDLC film and the technology associated with making smart
glass. The technology of SWIS Co. Ltd. will be owned by the Company through the
acquisition.

In the future, the Company plans to raise additional funds in order to build its
own factory and purchase machineries to manufacture the smart glass internally
using the patented technologies acquired through SWIS Co. Ltd.

There can be no assurances that the Company’s efforts to develop its proposed
smart glass solutions will succeed, or that the Company will be able to
successfully market the proposed smart glass solutions, if developed.

The Company is located at 9454 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 612, Beverly Hills,
California 90212. The Company’s main phone number is (888) 588-7974.

ITEM

Completion
of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets




 

On April
28, 2016, NextGlass Technologies Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”), agreed to acquire SWIS
Co., Ltd., based in Korea. SWIS Co., Ltd. holds as its principal
asset a plant located in Seoul, Korea and conducts operations
through the company’s research and development department.
Although the transaction was agreed between the parties on April
28, 2016 under Korean law, the change of ownership did not actually
occur until August 10, 2016. On that date, August 10, 2016, the
Korean government approved the acquisition of the third party
company, SWIS Co., Ltd., which was in connection with the Share
Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) entered
into on April 28, 2016. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the
Company purchased all 100,000 shares outstanding of SWIS Co.,
Ltd.

 

SWIS Co.,
Ltd. was established on September 2, 2014. Its major business is to
research and develop PDLC film and the technology associated with
making smart glass. The technology of SWIS Co. Ltd. will be owned
by the Company through the acquisition.

 

The
Company plans to produce and distribute glass products (which the
Company calls “smart glass” solutions). The Company
intends to make these products based on technology that is covered
by patents that it acquired from SWIS Co., Limited. The patents
covered consist of 9 patents. Eight of these patents are registered
in Korea, and one patent is registered in Taiwan.

 

In
association with the acquisition of SWIS Co., Ltd., Ken Low, a
principal of the Company, transferred 1,000,000 shares owned by him
to four former shareholders of SWIS Co. Ltd.
