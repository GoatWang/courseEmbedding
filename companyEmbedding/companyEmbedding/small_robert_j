PLEASE FILL THEM OUT IN ADVANCE OF YOUR VISIT AND BRING THEM WITH YOU WHEN YOU ARRIVE.GlaucomaA condition that affects the optic nerve. Typically it affects the peripheral vision first but can lead to total vision loss. This is a very slow, painless disease so often it can be unnoticed by patients until vision loss is severe. Routine eye exams are the best way to prevent early glaucoma damage.OphthalmologyFounded in 2000, NVISION Torrance is led by Franklin Lusby, M.D., Medical Director and Chief of Laser Surgery. Dr. Lusby has been practicing ophthalmology for 30 years, with a total of over 45,000 refractive procedures to date.Macular DegenerationAge-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in adults over age 50. This eye disease occurs when there are changes to the macula, a small portion of the retina that is located on the inside back layer of the eye. AMD is a loss of central vision that can occur in two forms: “dry” or atrophic and “wet” or exudative.CataractsThese are caused by UV damage to the lens inside of your eye. Symptoms of cataracts include decreased vision, cloudy vision, and glare while driving at night. Surgery is needed to treat cataracts.EndocrinologistDiabetes CareDiabetic RetinopathyOccurs in persons with diabetes, which causes progressive damage to the retina, the light sensitive lining at the back of the eye. It is a serious sight-threatening complication of diabetes and is the result of damage to the tiny blood vessels that nourish the retina. They leak blood and other fluids that cause swelling of retinal tissue and clouding of vision. If left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can cause blindness.Send to PhoneStahl, Robert J Dr1142 W Redondo Beach Blvd, Gardena, CA 90247(310) 323-5095Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailStahl, Robert J Dr1142 W Redondo Beach Blvd, Gardena, CA 90247(310) 323-5095Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

Robert J. Sawyer - Humans

Meanwhile, back on the real Earth, a Canadian geneticist named Mary Vaughan, who became friends with Boddit in the earlier adventure, misses him, especially after she is raped. The two are reunited when Mary travels to the Neanderthal world--a utopian society th...

Product Details



					HUMANS is the second volume in Sawyer's Neanderthal Parallax trilogy, the sequel to HOMINIDS (2002). The series is set on an alternative Earth, where homo sapiens is extinct, Neanderthals rule, and our hero is Ponter Boddit, a physicist. Meanwhile, back on the real Earth, a Canadian geneticist named Mary Vaughan, who became friends with Boddit in the earlier adventure, misses him, especially after she is raped. The two are reunited when Mary travels to the Neanderthal world--a utopian society though one with, as she discovers, some disturbing aspects. And the romance between these two unlikely creatures begins to heat up.
