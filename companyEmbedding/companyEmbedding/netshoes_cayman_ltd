We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately US$135.1 million from our
sale of 8,250,000 common shares (or US$155.9 million if the underwriters
exercise in full their over-allotment option) after deducting the underwriting
discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We believe that the offering will provide additional capital to support the
development and growth of our business. The principal purposes of this offering
are to increase our capitalization, provide us with greater financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common shares and facilitate our
future access to the capital markets. We currently intend to use our net
proceeds from this offering to finance our working capital needs and capital
expenditures, which may include, among others, investments in the development of
software, acquisition of property and equipment for our distribution centers,
although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any
investments. Any remaining net proceeds will be used for other general corporate
purposes. Pending determination of the use of our net proceeds, we may invest
them in highly liquid time deposits and similar instruments. Our management will
have broad discretion in allocating the net proceeds of this offering received
by us to each use.


eCommerce in Latin America includes a number of local players and a few global
companies focused on a wide variety of categories. Based on management’s
experience in, and knowledge of, the industry, we do not believe we have a
relevant direct competitor in the eCommerce sports category in the region, where
we are the leader in Brazil, and while we face competition in our fashion and
beauty categories, in just one year of operation we believe we have become a
clear contender for the market leader in Brazil. Our current or potential
competitors include the following:

• Brick-and-mortar stores: We face competition from brick-and-mortar retailers
  specialized in sporting goods, fashion and beauty and general brick-and-mortar
  retailers, some of which currently also sell, or in the future may sell, their
  products online. Based on management’s experience in, and knowledge of, the
  industry, we believe that most existing brick and mortar retail players in
  Latin America have limited eCommerce presence and are often focused on
  specific categories which, in general, are not core to us; such as electronics
  and household appliances. We believe that most retailers’ constraint to
  physical locations results in limited product offerings and restricts their
  operations to narrower geographies. In summary, we believe, based on
  management’s experience in, and knowledge of, the industry, that the nature of
  the eCommerce platforms developed by most brick-and-mortar stores is more of a
  complementary service rather than a priority for their business. Our platform,
  on the other hand, provides a unique solution to customers and focuses on more
  attractive product categories with a team of professionals solely dedicated to
  delivering a best-in-class customer service; and                          

• Pure-play eCommerce players: We face competition from (a) other B2C ecommerce
  retailers; (b) retailers and other sellers that conduct commerce through
  online marketplaces; and (c) a number of indirect competitors, including
  Internet portals and Internet search engines that are involved in online
  commerce, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers. We believe
  that, based on management’s experience in, and knowledge of, the industry,
  pure-play sports eCommerce players are fragmented within the region with no
  company having achieved scale other than us. Moreover, no consolidation
  strategy has been deployed by any local or global player.    

We believe our 19.1% growth in consolidated net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2016 was above the average of retail industries in Brazil.
According to Euromonitor International, in 2016 the total retail market in
Brazil grew by 4.4%, the internet retail market in Brazil grew by 8.0% and the
market for pure play internet retailers in Brazil grew by 8.3%.


Company Description
Our mission is to be the leading online consumer platform in Latin America. We
are the leading sports and lifestyle online retailer in Latin America and one of
the largest online retailers in the region, as measured by net sales. We operate
in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico and, since our launch, we


 have sold to more
than 12.8 million customers across our sites (representing a 22.0%
year-over-year growth from 2015), solidifying our position as one of the few
scaled online retailers in Latin America and creating a foundation of audience,
brand and capabilities on top of which we are building a digital ecosystem
capable of delivering increasing and significant value to customers and partners
in the future. Through our desktop and mobile websites and applications, which
we refer to as our “sites,” we deliver our customers a convenient and intuitive
online shopping experience across our two core brands, Netshoes and Zattini. We
believe that Netshoes has become one of the most recognized brands by consumers,
in Brazil and Argentina, among both online and offline sports retailers. We
believe that Zattini, a site we launched in December 2014, is quickly becoming a
leading online brand for fashion and beauty in Brazil in terms of consumer
recognition.

We were founded in January 2000 by Marcio Kumruian and Hagop Chabab as a single
physical shoe store in São Paulo, Brazil. In 2007, we closed our
brick-and-mortar stores and shifted to an online business to reach more
customers across Brazil. Since then, we have built on our initial success,
expanding across geographies and brands. We have also selectively introduced new
product categories, maintaining our core strategy of focusing on product
verticals with higher margins that have short replacement cycles and are easy to
ship.

Core to our success has been a relentless focus on delivering a superior
customer experience across each of the countries in which we operate, including
remote locations not typically served by traditional retailers. As one of the
first companies in Latin America to provide online retail offerings, we have
emphasized the importance of customer service, and we have also developed
technology that personalizes the shopping experience for our customers. This
core customer focus has driven customer loyalty, as demonstrated by our high
repeat purchasing. In the year ended December 31, 2016, 74.5% of our total
orders came from repeat customers.

Our sites are also optimized for mobile shopping. Despite Latin America’s
relatively low smartphone penetration rate, in the year ended December 31, 2016,
approximately 46.0% of total visits to our sites and 32.2% of the total orders
placed by our active customers came from mobile devices (while in Brazil, mobile
commerce accounted for 11.7% of eCommerce sales in 2015).

We are also a trusted partner and the go-to channel for the most important
brands in sports and lifestyle retail in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. We offer
over 190,000 stock keeping units, or SKUs, from over 500 brands, including Nike,
Adidas, Mizuno, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren and Lacoste and work closely with
our suppliers to promote and protect their brands and help manage product
selection. We believe we are one of the largest distribution channels for these
brands in Brazil and Latin America. We have also begun to develop our private
label brands to supplement our existing supplier relationships in key
categories.

Our success in the region has been dependent on our consistent ability to build
a solid infrastructure network to support our operations, as well as our
scalable and customized logistics capabilities. We have created a highly
automated picking, packing and inventory management system, built to efficiently
handle the products in which we specialize—easy-to-ship items with high margins
and short replacement cycles. We are able to ship over one million orders a
month, and on average, process the orders we receive within six hours after
confirmation, achieving an on-time delivery rate of approximately 97.0% of total
processed orders.

At the scale at which we operate, the combination of our customers, the brands
we offer and infrastructure we have developed has resulted in powerful network
effects, which we believe offer a significant competitive advantage. Our large
and growing Latin America customer base has allowed us to attract and retain
high quality brands, which in turn drives new and repeat customers. This has
driven our growth and has allowed us to continually reinvest in and improve our
product selection, technology and infrastructure while also driving significant
cost efficiencies. These network effects are evident in our financial
performance and scale. We also believe that these favorable network effects
allow us to expand the reach of our sites to build the leading online consumer
platform in Brazil and Latin America.

We have achieved the following significant milestones as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016:

• 5.6 million active customers, an increase of 18.9% from the 4.7 million active
  customers we had as of December 31, 2015;                          

• 10.3 million total orders on our sites, an increase of 20.8% from the 8.5
  million total orders for the year ended December 31, 2015;            

• 74.5% of our total orders were invoiced to repeat customers (which are 
  customers who have previously purchased from us), an increase from 72.9% for
  the year ended December 31, 2015;                                     

• 32.2% of our total orders were placed by customers on a mobile device, an 
  increase from 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015; and             

• In our Brazilian operations, positive cash flows from operations beginning
  in 2014 and positive EBITDA beginning in 2015.

Payless has women's shoes for every occasion and any time of year. From stylish sandals for the warm months to furry lined boots for cold and snow, you'll find what you're looking for at a great price. You'll look great, too, whether you're at the office, at the store, or enjoying a night out with friends or coworkers. 
Feeling more formal? Payless offers pumps and heels that emphasize both fun and sophistication, such as a sleek, pointed-toe style with a wrapped three-inch heel. You'll also find special occasion and holiday dress shoes for that extra touch of class.
For those chilly days and nights, you might choose a slipper, moccasin, short boot or tall boot. Look for lined moccasins to embrace your feet in furry comfort, commuter boots for good-looking durability, lined boots for luxurious warmth, and many other styles to keep your feet happy in the cold. But it doesn't have to be cold for boots. Anytime is right for a comfortable, eye-catching lace-up that works with just about any casual outfit.
Every closet should have a good selection of flats, and Payless fills the bill. You'll even find dance shoes – ballet, jazz, and tap. For on and off the dance floor, you can pick from Oxford, slip-on, ballet, moccasin, and dress flats in a wide variety of styles.
Sandals are a must-have for warmer weather, and you'll find wedges, gladiators, and many other styles. T-strap pump sandals are a terrific choice for a more formal look. Wedge slings are perfect for a shopping trip. Slides are ideal for a day at the pool or beach. You can choose the right sandal for any spring or summer occasion.
If you're the active type, Payless has the women's shoes to fit. You'll find running, skating, and walking shoes as well as canvas slip-ons and sneakers. So let the athlete in you run wild in style — or just relax and have a little fun. Either way, you'll look good doing it.
The only way to fully appreciate the wide selection, dazzling style, and great comfort of women's shoes from Payless is to see it for yourself. So shop online or at a Payless ShoeSource store today and add some footwear style to your closet.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
