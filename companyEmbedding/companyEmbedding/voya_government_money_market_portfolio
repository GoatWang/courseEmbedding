View Detailed Performance





1The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management fee through August 1, 2017.
					


The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See above “Average Annual Total Returns %” for performance information current to the most recent month-end. Returns for the other share classes will vary due to different charges and expenses. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a purchase at net asset value at the beginning of the period and a sale at net asset value at the end of the period; and assumes reinvestment of dividends, capital gain distributions and return of capital distributions/allocations, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the dividend reinvestment plan. Net asset value equals total Fund assets net of Fund expenses such as operating costs and management fees. Total investment return at net asset value is not annualized for periods less than one year.




Principal Risks
			The Fund is subject to the risks associated with investing in debt securities. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of the investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. Money market funds, like the Fund, are subject to less credit and interest rate risk than other income funds because they invest in short-term debt securities of the highest quality. Nevertheless, the value of the Fund’s investments may fall when interest rates rise and the Fund could lose money if the issuer of a debt security is unable to meet its financial obligations or goes bankrupt. Investments in mortgage-related securities may entail prepayment risk. Risks of concentrating in investments in the financial services sector include, but are not limited to the following: credit risk, interest rate risks, and regulatory risk (the impact of state or federal legislation and regulations). In addition, to the extent that the Fund further concentrates in the banking industry, the risks described above may be greater. International investing risks may include unfavorable political and economic developments, possible withholding taxes, seizure of foreign deposits, currency controls or other governmental restrictions that might affect payment of principal or interest. In addition, foreign banks are not regulated by U.S. banking authorities and are generally not bound by financial reporting standards comparable to U.S. banks. Repurchase agreements involve the purchase by the Fund of a security that the seller has agreed to buy back. If the seller defaults and the collateral value declines, the Fund might incur a loss. If the seller declares bankruptcy, the Fund may not be able to sell the collateral at the desired time. Prices of mortgage-related securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in the prepayment patterns on the underlying instruments. Some securities are guaranteed by the U.S. Government as to timely payments of interest and principal, the shares themselves are not insured or guaranteed. These and other risks are described more fully in the Fund’s prospectus.

 Average Annual Total Returns as of 06/30/2017    (shown in percentages)
 





 Mutual funds offered through a retirement plan are investments designed for retirement purposes.  Early withdrawals will reduce your account value and if taken prior to age 59 1/2, a 10% IRS penalty may apply. 





 The performance data quoted represents past performance.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.  For month-end performance which may be lower or higher than the performance data shown please call 800-584-6001.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that, when sold, an investment may be worth more or less than the original cost.  





 The returns assume reinvestment of all dividends (ordinary income and capital gains) and are net of management fees and other fund operating expenses. An asset based Administrative Fee is deducted from your account quarterly at an annual rate of 0.16% of balances held in each of the investment options including the Stable Value Option. These returns do not reflect any plan level administrative fees, if applicable; if reflected, returns would be less favorable. The performance data shown below also does not reflect an expense reimbursement which may be applied to participant accounts on a quarterly basis. If this expense reimbursement did apply and had been reflected, the performance data shown for each option would have been higher. Please contact your local representative for more information.
 





 The returns assume reinvestment of all dividends (ordinary income and capital gains) and are net of management fees and other fund operating expenses.

 The risks of investing in small company stocks may include relatively low trading volumes, a greater degree of change in earnings and greater short-term volatility. 





 Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and public disclosure, as well as economic and political risks. 





 Some of the Funds invest in securities guaranteed by the U.S. Government as to the timely payment of principal and interest; however, shares of the Funds are not insured nor guaranteed. 





 High yielding fixed-income securities generally are subject to greater market fluctuations and risks of loss of income and principal than are investments in lower yielding fixed-income securities. 





 Sector funds may involve greater-than average risk and are often more volatile than funds holding a diversified portfolio of stocks in many industries. Examples include: banking, biotechnology, chemicals, energy, environmental services, natural resources, precious metals, technology, telecommunications, and utilities. 





 *The Gross Expense Ratios shown do not reflect any temporary fee or expense waivers that may be in effect for a fund. The performance of a fund with a temporary fee or expense waiver would have been lower if the gross fund fees / expenses listed had been reflected.

(4) American Century One Choice Portfolio: The target date is the approximate year when investors plan to start withdrawing their money. The principal value of the investment is not guaranteed at any time, including at the target date.
Each portfolio seeks the highest total return consistent with its asset mix. Each year, the asset mix and weightings are adjusted to be more conservative.
