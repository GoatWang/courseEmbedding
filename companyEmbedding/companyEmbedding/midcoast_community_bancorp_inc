			 In March of 2007, a group of community-oriented business leaders and commercial bankers joined together to build a community bank dedicated to serving their own local communities. 
Locally owned and managed, MidCoast offers the value of local decisions on competitive loan and deposit products to individuals and businesses in the State of Delaware and the contiguous counties of Pennsylvania and Maryland. Since its inception, this combination of personal service, competitive products, and local decisions has been well received. 
While emphasizing a philosophy of “building relationships one at a time,” MidCoast has grown considerably throughout its market–lending millions of dollars to numerous small- and mid-sized businesses. Benefiting from this growth are the thousands of deposit customers who have embraced the bank’s deposit products and the outstanding personal service of its branch staff. We are especially pleased with the increasing loyalty of our valued customers who consider MidCoast first when making a decision on a deposit or loan product. 
As MidCoast continues to grow, we remain committed to serving the communities within our market. We look forward to introducing our products, personal service, and local decision process to an ever-larger portion of our community. Please do not hesitate to call or stop by one of our branches to experience for yourself, what a difference banking with a true local community bank can be.

GlobeNewswire



Mar 28, 2013 8:42 AM EDT













 




























































    BRYN MAWR, Pa., March 28, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation (Nasdaq:BMTC) (the "Corporation"), parent of The Bryn Mawr Trust Company (the "Bank"), today announced that the Corporation has entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire MidCoast Community Bancorp, Inc. ("MidCoast") and its wholly owned subsidiary MidCoast Community Bank, for approximately $33 million. MidCoast Community Bancorp, Inc. is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware. The acquisition builds upon the Corporation's existing footprint in Delaware by adding four branches, approximately $235 million in loans and approximately $250 million in deposits.  Ted Peters, Chairman and CEO, stated, "It is exciting to have MidCoast Community Bank join the Bryn Mawr Trust organization. MidCoast is one of the premier de novo banks in the nation, and it's gratifying that they have chosen us as their partner going forward." Mr. Peters added, "We are looking forward to quickly expanding our banking presence in the State of Delaware under MidCoast CEO Jim Ladio's leadership."  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, MidCoast will merge with and into the Corporation, with the Corporation surviving the merger (the "Merger"). Immediately after the Merger, MidCoast Community Bank, will merge with and into the Bank, with the Bank being the surviving entity.  Jim Ladio, President and CEO of MidCoast stated "We are very excited to be joining Bryn Mawr Trust, which will provide us with the products, services and resources that we need to continue to grow and serve our customers in the greater Wilmington, Delaware area."  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, stockholders of MidCoast will receive 0.52 shares of Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation common stock for each share of common stock they own. The transaction is subject to normal regulatory and MidCoast shareholder approval and is expected to close late in the third quarter of 2013.
