BiosketchDr Cohen is a clinician-investigator whose work has focused on normal tissue radiation injury, with emphasis on radiation nephropathy that can complicate hematopoietic stem cell transplants and is also a risk of accidental or belligerent radiation exposures. He has developed the concept of mitigation, which is the use of a drug or compound after irradiation but before expression of tissue injury, to attenuate the later consequences of irradiation. His laboratory work showed the great benefit of this approach, which he has translated to the clinic.
He has extended this interest to the broader area of Onco-Nephrology, which is the overlap area of those specialties. This includes renal complications of cancer and its treatment, cancers that may damage kidneys, and kidney cancer itself. He has edited a reference text, Cancer and the Kidney.
He has also had a longstanding clinical interest in mechanisms and measurement of urinary acidification, and was the first to show the molecular defect of H+-ATPase in acquired distal renal tubular acidosis.
His work is currently funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs and by the NIH.
