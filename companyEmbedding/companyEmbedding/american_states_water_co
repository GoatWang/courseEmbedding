Better Buy: Aqua America, Inc. vs. American States Water
Which of these companies is the better opportunity to wet your water investment whistle?











                Scott Levine
            

                (TMFProudMonkey)

President Trump may have won praise from both sides of the aisle when he revealed his intent to modernize America's aging infrastructure, but he also won the hearts of companies that would benefit from such an initiative -- companies like water utilities. Although his attention to the nation's infrastructure seems to have fallen by the wayside, though, it doesn't mean water utility stocks should be forsaken. 
Since demand for water isn't diminishing anytime soon, water utility stocks still have room for plenty of growth. So let's dive in and get to know two of the industry's leaders, Aqua America (NYSE:WTR) and American States Water (NYSE:AWR) a little better, to see which one offers investors the best opportunity.

Image source: Getty Images.

Getting our feet wet
The third-largest water utility by market cap, Aqua America has been providing water services for more than 130 years. Currently, it serves more than 3 million customers across eight states. In business since 1929, American States Water is a regional operator that deals in more than just water. In addition to its 261,000 water utility customers spread throughout 10 counties in California, American States Water also distributes electricity to Southern California's recreational area, Big Bear.
To round out this introduction to the two companies, let's compare them on some common metrics.



Company
Market Cap
Dividend Yield
FY 2016 Revenue
FY 2016 Earnings Per Share
FY 2016 Operating Margin
Return on Equity (3-Year Average)


Aqua America

$819.9 million
$1.32
39.7%
13.10%


American States Water 
$1.7 billion
2.00%
$436.1 million
$1.62
26.3%
12.32%



Data source: Morningstar.
A quick look at the companies' financials reveals that there's no runaway winner. American States Water may have swam in more profits last year, but Aqua America has been more successful over the past three years at converting shareholders' investments into profits. Having been briefly introduced to these two companies, let's jump in with both feet and get to know them better.
The case for Aqua America
Although investors familiar with water utilities don't expect dazzling growth on the companies' top lines, they do expect growth. In this regard, Aqua America is successful. Over the past five years, its revenue has risen at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.77%. Because Aqua America maintains operations across eight states, it mitigates the risk associated with adverse regional weather phenomenon -- something with which American States Water is all too familiar. Due in large part to the drought that has ravaged California, American States Water over the past five years has had a revenue CAGR of negative 1.36%. Although weather experts contend the drought is now over, there's no guarantee that a similar event won't happen in the future.
In conjunction with growing revenue, Aqua America has seen an increase in its cash flow. Achieving an increase of more than 7% from the $368 million that it reported in fiscal 2012, Aqua America reported operational cash flow of $396 million in fiscal 2016. American States Water's cash from operations, on the other hand, has ebbed over the same time period, falling by more than 4%.

WTR Cash from Operations (Annual). Data by YCharts.
For water utilities, growing operational cash flow is essential. It affords them the ability to grow through acquisitions and improve operational efficiency through asset renewal without having to rely too heavily on debt. Besides rate increases, Aqua America has increased its cash flow by growing its customer base through acquisitions. Thanks to a $53 million shopping spree over the past three years, Aqua America has completed 51 acquisitions; American States Water, conversely, completed none. Looking ahead, Aqua America has four pending acquisitions in fiscal 2017 estimated at more than $100 million, while American States Water has nothing on its horizon.





The case for American States Water
Growth in both revenue and cash flow growth are only two reasons among many to believe Aqua America is the more appealing opportunity; nonetheless, American States Water may attract investors with a more conservative bent. In spite of increasing its debt load more than Aqua America over the past few years, American States Water is currently less reliant on leverage and more liquid.

American States Water

Data source: Morningstar and author's calculations.
Also, with the worst of the California drought apparently behind it, American States Water may be on the verge of reversing course from the declining revenue and cash flow it has recently endured.
Perusing the price tags
We've taken a closer look at these two companies, now let's compare their valuations.

WTR price-to-sales ratio (TTM). Data by YCharts.
At first glance, American States Water may seem like a bargain since it trades at a lower sales multiple than Aqua America. Relative to its five-year average P/S ratio of 2.7, however, American States Water's valuation seems less attractive. And taken in concert with the fact that it trades at a higher cash from operations per share multiple, American States Water's stock doesn't seem so enticing.





And the winner is...
Undoubtedly, the better choice for investors at the moment is Aqua America. Beyond the fact that Aqua America's customer base entails a larger geographic footprint, which doesn't subject the company to the same risks as a regional operator like American States Water, Aqua America has demonstrated consistent growth that shows no signs of stopping. To confirm that the company remains on the right track moving forward, investors can look for it to continue its steady revenue and cash flow growth while executing its growth-through-acquisition strategy.

American States Water: An Expensive Dividend King - American States Water Co. (NYSE:AWR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»American States Water: An Expensive Dividend KingJun.29.17 | About: American States (AWR) Cash-Centered Creep Dividend growth investing, dividend investing, long-term horizonSummaryAmerican States Water reported decent Q1 results.It's a sustainable utility with over half-a-century of rising dividend payments.At present, the valuation is too rich to recommend as a buy.On May 2, American States Water (AWR) released their Q1 results, reporting EPS of $0.34 which beat estimates by $0.02, and revenues of $98.81 million which beat estimates by $6.71 million. The results were confirmation of the fact that this longstanding water utility is a profitable company, as its revenue and net income figures also attest.   Year Revenue ($) Net Income ($)   2012 466.91 million 54.15 million   2013 472.08 million 62.69 million   2014 465.79 million 61.06 million   2015 458.64 million 60.48 million   2016 436.09 million 59.74 million   The dividend record further underlines American States Water's profitability - the company has rewarded shareholders with consecutively rising dividends since 1955, a sixty-two year record that qualifies American States Water as a Dividend King, a stock that has paid consecutively rising dividends for 50+ years. Why is American States Water so profitable? The San Dimas, California based water utility holding company, which was founded in 1929 and has a market capitalization of $1.73 billion, benefits from the fact that water is a necessity for people to live. Demand for their service is therefore unlikely to dry up (pun intended!). The company divides its operations between two subsidiaries: the Golden State Water Company, or GSWC, and American States Utility Services, or ASUS. GSWC, the larger of the two subsidiaries, is a regulated water and electric utility which provides water service to approximately 261,000 customers throughout ten counties in Northern, Coastal and Southern California. GSWC also provides electricity to nearly 24,000 customers in California's Big Bear recreational area. ASUS is an unregulated subsidiary which provides operations, maintenance and construction management services for water and wastewater systems on military bases across the country, and hold fifty year privatization contracts with the U.S. Government for the provision of these services.
 

 These businesses - one a regulated utility with the geographical monopoly and regulatory barriers in California that limit competition, the other an unregulated subsidiary that has long-term contracts with the U.S. Government - would separately be reliable long-term propositions for an income investor. Combined, they make American States Water a sturdy candidate for an investor portfolio. But not at any price. Currently, American States Water is trading in the high-$40 range with a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.08, a forward P/E ratio of 26.49, and offers a dividend yield of 2.05% with a payout ratio of 55.05%. Both the P/E ratio and forward P/E ratio are higher than American States Water's five-year average P/E ratio of 22.36, and the dividend yield is lower than American States Water's five-year average dividend yield of 2.19%, which suggests that the stock is somewhat overvalued at this time. But by how much? Earnings per share over the past twelve months was $1.69, and EPS growth for the next five years is estimated to be 5.05%. Using an 11% discount rate - the stock market average - I calculate fair value for American States Water to be $29.64. The stock is overvalued by 60% at this time. This water utility tends to trade at a premium due to the essential nature of the service which both their subsidiaries provide, their geographical monopoly in the areas of California, and the regulatory barriers surrounding their GSWC operations that prevent serious competition. However, to pay 76% above fair value for a stock is simply unwise, and while it may be too much to expect American States Water to pull back to fair value, it should be closer to it before serious consideration is given to starting a position here.

American States Water Co (NYSE:AWR)
Gross Property, Plant and Equipment
=GURUF("AWR","Gross Property, Plant and Equipment")

$1,661.2 Mil (As of Mar. 2017)
American States Water Co's quarterly gross PPE declined from Sep. 2016 ($1,686.0 Mil) to Dec. 2016 ($1,683.7 Mil) and declined from Dec. 2016 ($1,683.7 Mil) to Mar. 2017 ($1,661.2 Mil).
American States Water Co's annual gross PPE increased from Dec. 2014 ($1,503.8 Mil) to Dec. 2015 ($1,590.5 Mil) and increased from Dec. 2015 ($1,590.5 Mil) to Dec. 2016 ($1,683.7 Mil).

Definition
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are the fixed assets of the company. Fixed assets are also known as non-current assets.
Property, plant, and equipment includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers.
Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are:

	Land
	Buildings (and leasehold improvements)
	Transportation equipment
	Manufacturing equipment
	Office equipment
	Office furniture

Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes:

	Track
	Ties
	Ballast
	Bridges
	Tunnels
	Signals
	Locomotives
	Freight Cars

There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a companys 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns.
The market value of property, plant, and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property, plant, and equipment.
For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away. That property, plant, and equipment was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land.
All property, plant, and equipment other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost.
The property, plant, and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property, plant, and equipment. This means it is the cost of the property, plant, and equipment less accumulated depreciation.

Explanation
A company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive. The company replaces when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.
Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows, whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance.
Producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson etc.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.
