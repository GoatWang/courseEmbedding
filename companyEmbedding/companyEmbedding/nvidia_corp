NVIDIA Corp.'s Most Popular Product in 2015
The graphics specialist's most popular product in 2015 was also its most controversial. 











                Ashraf Eassa
            

                (TMFChipFool)



            
            Feb 8, 2016 at 10:25AM
            
            





In late 2014, graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) launched a couple of new graphics processors based on its Maxwell architecture: the GTX 970 and the GTX 980. Easily the star of the show was the GTX 970, a card priced at around $330 that delivered similar performance as the company's GTX Titan graphics card, which launched at a whopping $999 in in early 2013.
However, some controversy around the card broke out in early 2015 due to two things:

NVIDIA had provided incorrect specifications in the reviewers' guide sent to professional reviewers; and
Although the GTX 970 cards came with four gigabytes of memory on board, only 3.5 gigabytes of this memory runs at "full speed," with the remaining half gigabyte running at lower speed.

At the time, this looked like a PR nightmare for the graphics specialist. However, fast-forward to today, it's clear that not only were NVIDIA's GTX 970 sales not particularly affected by this "controversy," but that the part was easily NVIDIA's most popular product among PC gamers in 2015.
Digging through the numbers These days, the vast majority of PC gamers use a program known as Steam to purchase, download, and play games. One of the nice things about Steam is that every month it conducts a hardware survey, which collects data on the kinds of components that Steam users (who are likely by and large gamers) have in their machines.
This data is very useful to game developers as it allows them to understand what kinds of hardware they can reasonably target for their games. One of the nice things about this data for the investment community is that it allows us to get a glimpse into what gamers are buying, market share shifts among component vendors, and so on.





At any rate, according to the Steam Hardware Survey, the GTX 970 -- as of January -- is the most popular graphics processor among gamers, capturing 4.28% share among all Steam users who participated in the survey.
The second most popular is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) HD Graphics 4000 with 3.19% share (likely casual gamers playing low-intensity games on laptops), with the NVIDIA GTX 960 coming in third place with 2.53% share.
GTX 970 has been and continues to be a hugely successful product for the graphics specialist.
What does this data tell us? In addition to painting a positive picture from a market share perspective for NVIDIA, these results also show that gamers are quite willing to pay for performance if they feel they're getting good value. The GTX 970 is a $330 card, which is hardly "budget" among discrete cards, and the GTX 960 is a roughly $200 card.





This is a long-term positive for NVIDIA. Indeed, I suspect that as long as NVIDIA is able to deliver compelling performance improvements at the typical gaming processor price points, it should be able to continue to grow its gaming graphics processor business nicely in the years ahead.
The next move for NVIDIA NVIDIA is expected to roll out its next-generation graphics architecture, known as Pascal, at some point in 2016. It's not clear yet when in 2016 the Pascal architecture will arrive, but I suspect that once it does, the performance enhancements it should bring to the table as a result of an updated architecture and a migration to a new chip manufacturing technology will be enough to catalyze another upgrade cycle among gamers.

Nvidia Corporation (/ɪnˈvɪdiə/ in-VID-eeə)[5] (most commonly referred to as Nvidia, stylized as NVIDIA, nVIDIA or nvidia) is an American technology company based in Santa Clara, California. It designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SOCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Its primary GPU product line, labeled "GeForce", is in direct competition with Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) "Radeon" products. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld SHIELD Portable, SHIELD Tablet and SHIELD Android TV.
Since 2014, Nvidia has shifted to become a platform company focused on four markets – gaming, professional visualization, data centers and auto.
In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[6][7] More recently, It has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[8][9][10] In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel, Qualcomm and ARM (e.g., because of Denver, while Nvidia also licenses ARM's designs).
Nvidia is now focused on artificial intelligence.[11]

Company history[edit]
The name of the company comes from Invidia in Roman mythology who corresponds to Nemesis.[12]
Founders and initial investment[edit]
Three people co-founded Nvidia in April 1993:[13][14]

Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2017), a Taiwanese-born American, previously Director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Chris Malachowsky, an electrical engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems
Curtis Priem, previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at Sun Microsystems

The founders received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[15]
Major releases and acquisitions[edit]





This section may be too long and excessively detailed. Please consider summarizing the material while citing sources as needed. (December 2016)


RIVA TNT in 1998 solidified Nvidia's reputation for capable hardware.
Late 1999 saw the release of the GeForce 256 (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.
Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000.
In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from mid 1990s until 2000.[16][17] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[18]
In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[19]
In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[20]
On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[21]
In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. In May 2005, Microsoft chose to license a design by ATI and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the Xbox 360 graphics hardware, as had Nintendo for the Wii console (which succeeded the ATI-based Nintendo GameCube).[22]
On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[23]
In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[24]
In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[25]
Forbes magazine named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous 5 years.[26]
On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[27]
In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[28][29]
In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had "abnormal failure rates" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[30][31]
On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[32]
In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-chip for mobile devices. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[33][34]
In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[35]
In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system-on-chip.[36]
On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[citation needed]
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GeForce 10 series GPUs, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[37][38][39]
In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of RAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[40]
In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota will use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[41]
In July 2017, NVIDIA Corporation and Chinese search giant Baidu, Inc. announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI supercomputer will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform. [42]
GPU Technology Conference[edit]
The GPU Technology Conference is an annual technical conference started by Nvidia in 2009 which focuses on using the GPU to solve computing challenges.[43] In 2015, the conference attracted over 4000 attendees.[44]
Product families[edit]




The Nvidia GTX 1070 video card, which uses a 16 nm Pascal chip and was first released in June 2016.


Nvidia's family includes primarily graphics, wireless communication, PC processors and automotive hardware/software. Some families are listed below:

GeForce, consumer-oriented graphics processing products
Quadro computer-aided design and digital content creation workstation graphics processing products
NVS, multi-display business graphics solution
Tegra, a system on a chip series for mobile devices
Tesla, dedicated general purpose GPU for high-end image generation applications in professional and scientific fields
nForce, a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia for Intel (Celeron, Pentium and Core 2) and AMD (Athlon and Duron) microprocessors
Nvidia Grid, a set of hardware and services by Nvidia for graphics virtualization
Nvidia Shield, a range of gaming hardware including the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet and, most recently, the Shield Android TV
Nvidia Drive automotive solutions, a range of hardware and software products for assisting car drivers. The Drive PX-series is a high performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning,[45] while Driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars.[46]

Open-source software support[edit]
See also: Free and open-source device drivers: graphics, Mesa 3D, and nouveau (software)
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware,[47] meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and open-source device driver for its products without resorting to (clean room) reverse engineering.
Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and a thin open-source library that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[48]
The proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.[49] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers, and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as wholly inadequate, given that competing manufacturers (like Intel) offer support and documentation for open-source developers, and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[50][51]
Because of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides x86/x64 driver builds.[52] As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on PowerPC does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the hypervisor-restricted PlayStation 3 console.
Some users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[53]
Deep learning[edit]
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, artificial intelligence, and accelerated analytics. The company developed GPU-based deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection, weather prediction, and self-driving vehicles.[54] They are included in all Tesla vehicles.[55] The purpose is to help networks learn to “think”.[56] According to TechRepublic, Nvidia GPUs “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing, and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning.”[57] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[58] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).”[59] That year, the Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[60]
In April 2016 Nvidia produced the DGX-1 supercomputer based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[61] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[62] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS’s P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[63] called IBM PowerAI.[64][65] Nvidia also offers its own NVIDIA Deep Learning software development kit. [66] In 2017 the GPUs were also brought online at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[67] The company’s deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[68]

Nvidia Corporation (/ɪnˈvɪdiə/ in-VID-eeə)[5] (most commonly referred to as Nvidia, stylized as NVIDIA, nVIDIA or nvidia) is an American technology company based in Santa Clara, California. It designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SOCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Its primary GPU product line, labeled "GeForce", is in direct competition with Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) "Radeon" products. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld SHIELD Portable, SHIELD Tablet and SHIELD Android TV.
Since 2014, Nvidia has shifted to become a platform company focused on four markets – gaming, professional visualization, data centers and auto.
In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[6][7] More recently, It has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[8][9][10] In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel, Qualcomm and ARM (e.g., because of Denver, while Nvidia also licenses ARM's designs).
Nvidia is now focused on artificial intelligence.[11]

This section may be too long and excessively detailed. Please consider summarizing the material while citing sources as needed. (December 2016)


RIVA TNT in 1998 solidified Nvidia's reputation for capable hardware.
Late 1999 saw the release of the GeForce 256 (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.
Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000.
In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from mid 1990s until 2000.[16][17] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[18]
In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[19]
In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[20]
On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[21]
In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. In May 2005, Microsoft chose to license a design by ATI and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the Xbox 360 graphics hardware, as had Nintendo for the Wii console (which succeeded the ATI-based Nintendo GameCube).[22]
On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[23]
In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[24]
In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[25]
Forbes magazine named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous 5 years.[26]
On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[27]
In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[28][29]
In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had "abnormal failure rates" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[30][31]
On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[32]
In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-chip for mobile devices. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[33][34]
In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[35]
In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system-on-chip.[36]
On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[citation needed]
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GeForce 10 series GPUs, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[37][38][39]
In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of RAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[40]
In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota will use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[41]
In July 2017, NVIDIA Corporation and Chinese search giant Baidu, Inc. announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI supercomputer will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform. [42]
GPU Technology Conference[edit]
The GPU Technology Conference is an annual technical conference started by Nvidia in 2009 which focuses on using the GPU to solve computing challenges.[43] In 2015, the conference attracted over 4000 attendees.[44]
Product families[edit]




The Nvidia GTX 1070 video card, which uses a 16 nm Pascal chip and was first released in June 2016.


Nvidia's family includes primarily graphics, wireless communication, PC processors and automotive hardware/software. Some families are listed below:

GeForce, consumer-oriented graphics processing products
Quadro computer-aided design and digital content creation workstation graphics processing products
NVS, multi-display business graphics solution
Tegra, a system on a chip series for mobile devices
Tesla, dedicated general purpose GPU for high-end image generation applications in professional and scientific fields
nForce, a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia for Intel (Celeron, Pentium and Core 2) and AMD (Athlon and Duron) microprocessors
Nvidia Grid, a set of hardware and services by Nvidia for graphics virtualization
Nvidia Shield, a range of gaming hardware including the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet and, most recently, the Shield Android TV
Nvidia Drive automotive solutions, a range of hardware and software products for assisting car drivers. The Drive PX-series is a high performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning,[45] while Driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars.[46]

Open-source software support[edit]
See also: Free and open-source device drivers: graphics, Mesa 3D, and nouveau (software)
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware,[47] meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and open-source device driver for its products without resorting to (clean room) reverse engineering.
Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and a thin open-source library that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[48]
The proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.[49] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers, and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as wholly inadequate, given that competing manufacturers (like Intel) offer support and documentation for open-source developers, and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[50][51]
Because of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides x86/x64 driver builds.[52] As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on PowerPC does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the hypervisor-restricted PlayStation 3 console.
Some users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[53]
Deep learning[edit]
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, artificial intelligence, and accelerated analytics. The company developed GPU-based deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection, weather prediction, and self-driving vehicles.[54] They are included in all Tesla vehicles.[55] The purpose is to help networks learn to “think”.[56] According to TechRepublic, Nvidia GPUs “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing, and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning.”[57] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[58] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).”[59] That year, the Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[60]
In April 2016 Nvidia produced the DGX-1 supercomputer based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[61] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[62] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS’s P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[63] called IBM PowerAI.[64][65] Nvidia also offers its own NVIDIA Deep Learning software development kit. [66] In 2017 the GPUs were also brought online at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[67] The company’s deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[68]

Nvidia Corporation (/ɪnˈvɪdiə/ in-VID-eeə)[5] (most commonly referred to as Nvidia, stylized as NVIDIA, nVIDIA or nvidia) is an American technology company based in Santa Clara, California. It designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SOCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Its primary GPU product line, labeled "GeForce", is in direct competition with Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) "Radeon" products. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld SHIELD Portable, SHIELD Tablet and SHIELD Android TV.
Since 2014, Nvidia has shifted to become a platform company focused on four markets – gaming, professional visualization, data centers and auto.
In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[6][7] More recently, It has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[8][9][10] In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel, Qualcomm and ARM (e.g., because of Denver, while Nvidia also licenses ARM's designs).
Nvidia is now focused on artificial intelligence.[11]

Company history[edit]
The name of the company comes from Invidia in Roman mythology who corresponds to Nemesis.[12]
Founders and initial investment[edit]
Three people co-founded Nvidia in April 1993:[13][14]

Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2017), a Taiwanese-born American, previously Director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Chris Malachowsky, an electrical engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems
Curtis Priem, previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at Sun Microsystems

The founders received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[15]
Major releases and acquisitions[edit]





This section may be too long and excessively detailed. Please consider summarizing the material while citing sources as needed. (December 2016)


RIVA TNT in 1998 solidified Nvidia's reputation for capable hardware.
Late 1999 saw the release of the GeForce 256 (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.
Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000.
In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from mid 1990s until 2000.[16][17] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[18]
In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[19]
In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[20]
On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[21]
In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. In May 2005, Microsoft chose to license a design by ATI and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the Xbox 360 graphics hardware, as had Nintendo for the Wii console (which succeeded the ATI-based Nintendo GameCube).[22]
On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[23]
In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[24]
In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[25]
Forbes magazine named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous 5 years.[26]
On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[27]
In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[28][29]
In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had "abnormal failure rates" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[30][31]
On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[32]
In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-chip for mobile devices. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[33][34]
In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[35]
In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system-on-chip.[36]
On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[citation needed]
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GeForce 10 series GPUs, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[37][38][39]
In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of RAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[40]
In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota will use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[41]
In July 2017, NVIDIA Corporation and Chinese search giant Baidu, Inc. announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI supercomputer will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform. [42]
GPU Technology Conference[edit]
The GPU Technology Conference is an annual technical conference started by Nvidia in 2009 which focuses on using the GPU to solve computing challenges.[43] In 2015, the conference attracted over 4000 attendees.[44]
Product families[edit]




The Nvidia GTX 1070 video card, which uses a 16 nm Pascal chip and was first released in June 2016.


Nvidia's family includes primarily graphics, wireless communication, PC processors and automotive hardware/software. Some families are listed below:

GeForce, consumer-oriented graphics processing products
Quadro computer-aided design and digital content creation workstation graphics processing products
NVS, multi-display business graphics solution
Tegra, a system on a chip series for mobile devices
Tesla, dedicated general purpose GPU for high-end image generation applications in professional and scientific fields
nForce, a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia for Intel (Celeron, Pentium and Core 2) and AMD (Athlon and Duron) microprocessors
Nvidia Grid, a set of hardware and services by Nvidia for graphics virtualization
Nvidia Shield, a range of gaming hardware including the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet and, most recently, the Shield Android TV
Nvidia Drive automotive solutions, a range of hardware and software products for assisting car drivers. The Drive PX-series is a high performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning,[45] while Driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars.[46]

Open-source software support[edit]
See also: Free and open-source device drivers: graphics, Mesa 3D, and nouveau (software)
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware,[47] meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and open-source device driver for its products without resorting to (clean room) reverse engineering.
Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and a thin open-source library that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[48]
The proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.[49] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers, and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as wholly inadequate, given that competing manufacturers (like Intel) offer support and documentation for open-source developers, and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[50][51]
Because of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides x86/x64 driver builds.[52] As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on PowerPC does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the hypervisor-restricted PlayStation 3 console.
Some users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[53]
Deep learning[edit]
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, artificial intelligence, and accelerated analytics. The company developed GPU-based deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection, weather prediction, and self-driving vehicles.[54] They are included in all Tesla vehicles.[55] The purpose is to help networks learn to “think”.[56] According to TechRepublic, Nvidia GPUs “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing, and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning.”[57] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[58] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).”[59] That year, the Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[60]
In April 2016 Nvidia produced the DGX-1 supercomputer based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[61] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[62] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS’s P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[63] called IBM PowerAI.[64][65] Nvidia also offers its own NVIDIA Deep Learning software development kit. [66] In 2017 the GPUs were also brought online at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[67] The company’s deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[68]

Nvidia Corporation (/ɪnˈvɪdiə/ in-VID-eeə)[5] (most commonly referred to as Nvidia, stylized as NVIDIA, nVIDIA or nvidia) is an American technology company based in Santa Clara, California. It designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SOCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Its primary GPU product line, labeled "GeForce", is in direct competition with Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) "Radeon" products. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld SHIELD Portable, SHIELD Tablet and SHIELD Android TV.
Since 2014, Nvidia has shifted to become a platform company focused on four markets – gaming, professional visualization, data centers and auto.
In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[6][7] More recently, It has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[8][9][10] In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel, Qualcomm and ARM (e.g., because of Denver, while Nvidia also licenses ARM's designs).
Nvidia is now focused on artificial intelligence.[11]

Company history[edit]
The name of the company comes from Invidia in Roman mythology who corresponds to Nemesis.[12]
Founders and initial investment[edit]
Three people co-founded Nvidia in April 1993:[13][14]

Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2017), a Taiwanese-born American, previously Director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Chris Malachowsky, an electrical engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems
Curtis Priem, previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at Sun Microsystems

The founders received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[15]
Major releases and acquisitions[edit]





This section may be too long and excessively detailed. Please consider summarizing the material while citing sources as needed. (December 2016)


RIVA TNT in 1998 solidified Nvidia's reputation for capable hardware.
Late 1999 saw the release of the GeForce 256 (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.
Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000.
In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from mid 1990s until 2000.[16][17] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[18]
In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[19]
In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[20]
On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[21]
In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. In May 2005, Microsoft chose to license a design by ATI and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the Xbox 360 graphics hardware, as had Nintendo for the Wii console (which succeeded the ATI-based Nintendo GameCube).[22]
On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[23]
In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[24]
In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[25]
Forbes magazine named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous 5 years.[26]
On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[27]
In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[28][29]
In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had "abnormal failure rates" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[30][31]
On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[32]
In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-chip for mobile devices. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[33][34]
In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[35]
In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system-on-chip.[36]
On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[citation needed]
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GeForce 10 series GPUs, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[37][38][39]
In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of RAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[40]
In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota will use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[41]
In July 2017, NVIDIA Corporation and Chinese search giant Baidu, Inc. announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI supercomputer will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform. [42]
GPU Technology Conference[edit]
The GPU Technology Conference is an annual technical conference started by Nvidia in 2009 which focuses on using the GPU to solve computing challenges.[43] In 2015, the conference attracted over 4000 attendees.[44]
Product families[edit]




The Nvidia GTX 1070 video card, which uses a 16 nm Pascal chip and was first released in June 2016.


Nvidia's family includes primarily graphics, wireless communication, PC processors and automotive hardware/software. Some families are listed below:

GeForce, consumer-oriented graphics processing products
Quadro computer-aided design and digital content creation workstation graphics processing products
NVS, multi-display business graphics solution
Tegra, a system on a chip series for mobile devices
Tesla, dedicated general purpose GPU for high-end image generation applications in professional and scientific fields
nForce, a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia for Intel (Celeron, Pentium and Core 2) and AMD (Athlon and Duron) microprocessors
Nvidia Grid, a set of hardware and services by Nvidia for graphics virtualization
Nvidia Shield, a range of gaming hardware including the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet and, most recently, the Shield Android TV
Nvidia Drive automotive solutions, a range of hardware and software products for assisting car drivers. The Drive PX-series is a high performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning,[45] while Driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars.[46]

Open-source software support[edit]
See also: Free and open-source device drivers: graphics, Mesa 3D, and nouveau (software)
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware,[47] meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and open-source device driver for its products without resorting to (clean room) reverse engineering.
Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and a thin open-source library that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[48]
The proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.[49] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers, and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as wholly inadequate, given that competing manufacturers (like Intel) offer support and documentation for open-source developers, and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[50][51]
Because of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides x86/x64 driver builds.[52] As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on PowerPC does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the hypervisor-restricted PlayStation 3 console.
Some users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[53]
Deep learning[edit]
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, artificial intelligence, and accelerated analytics. The company developed GPU-based deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection, weather prediction, and self-driving vehicles.[54] They are included in all Tesla vehicles.[55] The purpose is to help networks learn to “think”.[56] According to TechRepublic, Nvidia GPUs “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing, and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning.”[57] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[58] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).”[59] That year, the Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[60]
In April 2016 Nvidia produced the DGX-1 supercomputer based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[61] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[62] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS’s P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[63] called IBM PowerAI.[64][65] Nvidia also offers its own NVIDIA Deep Learning software development kit. [66] In 2017 the GPUs were also brought online at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[67] The company’s deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[68]

Nvidia Corporation (/ɪnˈvɪdiə/ in-VID-eeə)[5] (most commonly referred to as Nvidia, stylized as NVIDIA, nVIDIA or nvidia) is an American technology company based in Santa Clara, California. It designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SOCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Its primary GPU product line, labeled "GeForce", is in direct competition with Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) "Radeon" products. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld SHIELD Portable, SHIELD Tablet and SHIELD Android TV.
Since 2014, Nvidia has shifted to become a platform company focused on four markets – gaming, professional visualization, data centers and auto.
In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[6][7] More recently, It has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[8][9][10] In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel, Qualcomm and ARM (e.g., because of Denver, while Nvidia also licenses ARM's designs).
Nvidia is now focused on artificial intelligence.[11]

Company history[edit]
The name of the company comes from Invidia in Roman mythology who corresponds to Nemesis.[12]
Founders and initial investment[edit]
Three people co-founded Nvidia in April 1993:[13][14]

Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2017), a Taiwanese-born American, previously Director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Chris Malachowsky, an electrical engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems
Curtis Priem, previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at Sun Microsystems

The founders received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[15]
Major releases and acquisitions[edit]





This section may be too long and excessively detailed. Please consider summarizing the material while citing sources as needed. (December 2016)


RIVA TNT in 1998 solidified Nvidia's reputation for capable hardware.
Late 1999 saw the release of the GeForce 256 (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.
Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000.
In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from mid 1990s until 2000.[16][17] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[18]
In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[19]
In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[20]
On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[21]
In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. In May 2005, Microsoft chose to license a design by ATI and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the Xbox 360 graphics hardware, as had Nintendo for the Wii console (which succeeded the ATI-based Nintendo GameCube).[22]
On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[23]
In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[24]
In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[25]
Forbes magazine named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous 5 years.[26]
On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[27]
In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[28][29]
In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had "abnormal failure rates" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[30][31]
On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[32]
In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-chip for mobile devices. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[33][34]
In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[35]
In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system-on-chip.[36]
On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[citation needed]
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GeForce 10 series GPUs, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[37][38][39]
In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of RAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[40]
In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota will use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[41]
In July 2017, NVIDIA Corporation and Chinese search giant Baidu, Inc. announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI supercomputer will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform. [42]
GPU Technology Conference[edit]
The GPU Technology Conference is an annual technical conference started by Nvidia in 2009 which focuses on using the GPU to solve computing challenges.[43] In 2015, the conference attracted over 4000 attendees.[44]
Product families[edit]




The Nvidia GTX 1070 video card, which uses a 16 nm Pascal chip and was first released in June 2016.


Nvidia's family includes primarily graphics, wireless communication, PC processors and automotive hardware/software. Some families are listed below:

GeForce, consumer-oriented graphics processing products
Quadro computer-aided design and digital content creation workstation graphics processing products
NVS, multi-display business graphics solution
Tegra, a system on a chip series for mobile devices
Tesla, dedicated general purpose GPU for high-end image generation applications in professional and scientific fields
nForce, a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia for Intel (Celeron, Pentium and Core 2) and AMD (Athlon and Duron) microprocessors
Nvidia Grid, a set of hardware and services by Nvidia for graphics virtualization
Nvidia Shield, a range of gaming hardware including the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet and, most recently, the Shield Android TV
Nvidia Drive automotive solutions, a range of hardware and software products for assisting car drivers. The Drive PX-series is a high performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning,[45] while Driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars.[46]

Open-source software support[edit]
See also: Free and open-source device drivers: graphics, Mesa 3D, and nouveau (software)
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware,[47] meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and open-source device driver for its products without resorting to (clean room) reverse engineering.
Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and a thin open-source library that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[48]
The proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.[49] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers, and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as wholly inadequate, given that competing manufacturers (like Intel) offer support and documentation for open-source developers, and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[50][51]
Because of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides x86/x64 driver builds.[52] As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on PowerPC does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the hypervisor-restricted PlayStation 3 console.
Some users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[53]
Deep learning[edit]
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, artificial intelligence, and accelerated analytics. The company developed GPU-based deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection, weather prediction, and self-driving vehicles.[54] They are included in all Tesla vehicles.[55] The purpose is to help networks learn to “think”.[56] According to TechRepublic, Nvidia GPUs “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing, and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning.”[57] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[58] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).”[59] That year, the Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[60]
In April 2016 Nvidia produced the DGX-1 supercomputer based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[61] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[62] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS’s P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[63] called IBM PowerAI.[64][65] Nvidia also offers its own NVIDIA Deep Learning software development kit. [66] In 2017 the GPUs were also brought online at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[67] The company’s deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[68]

Why NVIDIA Corporation's Volta Gaming Products Won't Use HBM2
For consumer-oriented products, the potential technical advantages of HBM2 memory are outweighed by other considerations. 











                Ashraf Eassa
            

                (TMFChipFool)



            
            May 22, 2017 at 2:15PM
            
            





Over in DigiTimes, contributor Nebojsa Novakovic recently speculated that gaming-oriented graphics processors based on NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently announced Volta architecture could use a type of video memory known as HBM2 ("high bandwidth memory 2") rather than a more traditional graphics double data rate (GDDR) memory.
HBM2 memory is believed to be more expensive to produce than traditional GDDR-type memory, but the idea is that HBM2 is said to offer power efficiency and physical footprint advantages over GDDR-type memories.

Image source: NVIDIA.

Today, NVIDIA's GP100 chip -- which powers the company's Tesla P100 datacenter accelerator and its Quadro GP100 professional visualization accelerator -- uses HBM2, while the company's gaming-oriented Pascal products (GP102, GP104, GP106, GP107, GP108) use either GDDR5X (for higher-end products) or GDDR5 (for lower-end products).
NVIDIA's first Volta-based product, known as GV100, will include a faster flavor of HBM2 memory than what's currently found on the GP100. However, I doubt that NVIDIA will utilize this technology in the gaming-oriented versions of Volta.
Cost and capacity issues
First, the use of HBM2 would likely drive product costs up. Even if NVIDIA restricted HBM2 use to the higher-end of its Volta-based product stack, use of the technology could possibly either lead to increased product prices for end users (reducing demand) or lower gross profit margins for NVIDIA.





For datacenter-targeted accelerators like the P100 or V100, product manufacturing cost isn't as important a consideration as it is for consumer-grade products because datacenter customers care about total cost of ownership, not necessarily upfront product acquisition costs.
So, if NVIDIA charges datacenter customers more for a potentially more space/power efficient product, then they'll probably gladly pay as the space/power efficiency improvements would probably lead to cheaper-to-own products over the long-run (even if initial acquisition costs are higher).
For gaming products, efficiency is obviously important, but upfront acquisition costs are also a significant consideration. Remember, gamers aren't buying these graphics cards to perform work that will allow them to generate a financial return on their initial investments -- they're buying these cards so that they can play video games with their personal cash.
Further, even if NVIDIA were to adopt HBM2 in high-end/enthusiast gaming products, it would probably need to limit the cards to 8GB of memory to keep product costs sane; NVIDIA's high-end GeForce GTX 1080 Ti currently packs 11GB of GDDR5X memory and I don't think the company would want to deliver a capacity regression to customers.





GDDR is good enough
Obviously in addition to power efficiency considerations, the whole point of HBM2 is to give graphics processors access to a lot of memory bandwidth (that is, to allow the graphics processor to read from and write to memory as quickly as possible).
However, NVIDIA seems to be able to use GDDR-type memories to give its graphics processors access to a substantial amount of memory bandwidth. The company's latest Titan Xp graphics card, for example, uses fast GDDR5X and a wide memory interface to deliver 547.7GB/second of memory bandwidth.
That's less bandwidth than what the current Pascal P100 or upcoming Volta V100 have access to, but it's certainly the most memory bandwidth available to any gaming-oriented graphics processor today.
Furthermore, SK Hynix recently announced extremely fast GDDR6 memory that should, using a similarly wide memory interface as the one on the Titan Xp, deliver 768 GB/second of bandwidth. Again, that's less than the 900 GB/second of bandwidth that the Volta-based V100 has access to, but the difference isn't that huge.





In light of this discussion, I just can't see NVIDIA using HBM2 in its upcoming Volta-architecture gaming graphics processors when potentially cheaper GDDR-type memory should be able to do the trick.

					Full Description



Nvidia Corporation, incorporated on February 24, 1998, focuses on personal computer (PC) graphics, graphics processing unit (GPU) and also on artificial intelligence (AI). The Company provides service to its customers through PC, mobile and cloud architectures. The Company operates through two segments: GPU and Tegra Processor, which are based on a single underlying architecture. The Company's processor has created platforms that address four markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive. The Company's GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets, including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers, and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. The Company's Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core central processing units (CPUs) to drive supercomputing for mobile gaming and entertainment devices, as well as autonomous robots, drones and cars.GamingThe Company's gaming platforms utilizes three-dimensional (3D) software and algorithms, including its GameWorks libraries that provide special effects for games. These enable it to deliver realism and immersion, even when playing games remotely from the cloud. Its GeForce Experience, the gaming application optimizes the PC user's settings for each title and enables players to record and share gameplay. It provides developers with a suite of software libraries called VRWorks to enable virtual reality. VRWorks allows developers to create immersive experiences by enabling physically realistic visuals, sound, touch interactions and simulated environments. Its products for the gaming market include GeForce GTX GPUs for PC gaming; the SHIELD family of tablets, portable devices for mobile gaming and television (TV) streaming, and GeForce NOW for cloud-based gaming; as well as platforms and development services for specialized console gaming devices.Professional VisualizationThe Company serves the Professional Visualization market by working with independent software vendors to optimize their offerings for its GPUs. Its GPU computing solutions enhance productivity and introduce capabilities for parts of the workflow for such industries as automotive, media and entertainment, architectural engineering, oil and gas, and medical imaging. Its Iray and DesignWorks software enables an architect designing a building with a computer-aided design package to interact with the model in real time, view it in detail, and generate photorealistic renderings for the client. They also allow an automotive designer to create a realistic 3D image of a car, which can be viewed from all angles, reducing reliance on costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training, architectural walkthroughs, and bringing historical scenes to life all deploy this technology, powered by its GPUs. Visual computing is vital to productivity in many environments, including Design and Manufacturing, which includes computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-products manufacturing, medical instrumentation and aerospace, and Digital Content Creation, which includes professional video editing and post production, special effects for films and broadcast-television graphics. Its brand for this market is Quadro for workstations.DatacenterThe Company's accelerated computing platform addresses AI, in which systems learn using unstructured data, and computing, in which it speeds work toward reaching answers for narrowly defined problems. The platform consists of GPUs, its CUDA programming language, specific libraries, such as cuDNN, and inventions, such as NVLink, which enables application scalability across multiple GPUs. It is engaged with companies working on AI in a multitude of industries, from automating tasks, such as reading medical images, to surveying coral on the sea bottom, to identifying the physical world for the blind. It provides a family of GPUs designed to speed up training and inferencing of neural networks. They are available in industry standard servers from companies, such as HP, Dell and Cisco; from cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services, Alicloud, Azure and Google Cloud; as well as in its DGX AI supercomputer, a purpose-built system for learning and AI accelerated analytics. DGX comes fully integrated with hardware, deep learning software, development tools, support for existing AI frameworks, and runs popular accelerated analytics applications.GPUs also increases the speed of applications used in such fields as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. They have already had an impact on scientific discovery, including improving heart surgery, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) research and mapping human genome folds. Accelerated computing is recognized as the path forward for computing amid the slowing of Moore's Law. Tesla GPU accelerators power many of the world's supercomputers. They will also drive the United States Energy Department's supercomputers at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. It also serves the datacenter market with GRID for virtualized graphics. GRID makes it possible to run graphics-intensive applications remotely on a server in the datacenter.AutomotiveThe Company is working with automotive partners to enable AI pilot and co-pilot within the car. It is working with automakers, tier-one suppliers, automotive research institutions, high definition (HD) mapping companies, and startups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Its unified AI computing architecture starts with mapping and training neural networks using its Tesla GPUs, and then running them within the vehicle on the its DRIVE PX AI car computing platform.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Nvidia Corporation (/ɪnˈvɪdiə/ in-VID-eeə)[5] (most commonly referred to as Nvidia, stylized as NVIDIA, nVIDIA or nvidia) is an American technology company based in Santa Clara, California. It designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SOCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Its primary GPU product line, labeled "GeForce", is in direct competition with Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) "Radeon" products. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld SHIELD Portable, SHIELD Tablet and SHIELD Android TV.
Since 2014, Nvidia has shifted to become a platform company focused on four markets – gaming, professional visualization, data centers and auto.
In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[6][7] More recently, It has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[8][9][10] In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel, Qualcomm and ARM (e.g., because of Denver, while Nvidia also licenses ARM's designs).
Nvidia is now focused on artificial intelligence.[11]

RIVA TNT in 1998 solidified Nvidia's reputation for capable hardware.
Late 1999 saw the release of the GeForce 256 (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.
Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000.
In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from mid 1990s until 2000.[16][17] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[18]
In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[19]
In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[20]
On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[21]
In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. In May 2005, Microsoft chose to license a design by ATI and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the Xbox 360 graphics hardware, as had Nintendo for the Wii console (which succeeded the ATI-based Nintendo GameCube).[22]
On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[23]
In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[24]
In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[25]
Forbes magazine named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous 5 years.[26]
On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[27]
In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[28][29]
In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had "abnormal failure rates" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[30][31]
On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[32]
In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-chip for mobile devices. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[33][34]
In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[35]
In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system-on-chip.[36]
On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[citation needed]
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GeForce 10 series GPUs, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[37][38][39]
In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of RAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[40]
In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota will use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[41]
In July 2017, NVIDIA Corporation and Chinese search giant Baidu, Inc. announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI supercomputer will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform. [42]
GPU Technology Conference[edit]
The GPU Technology Conference is an annual technical conference started by Nvidia in 2009 which focuses on using the GPU to solve computing challenges.[43] In 2015, the conference attracted over 4000 attendees.[44]
Product families[edit]




The Nvidia GTX 1070 video card, which uses a 16 nm Pascal chip and was first released in June 2016.


Nvidia's family includes primarily graphics, wireless communication, PC processors and automotive hardware/software. Some families are listed below:

GeForce, consumer-oriented graphics processing products
Quadro computer-aided design and digital content creation workstation graphics processing products
NVS, multi-display business graphics solution
Tegra, a system on a chip series for mobile devices
Tesla, dedicated general purpose GPU for high-end image generation applications in professional and scientific fields
nForce, a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia for Intel (Celeron, Pentium and Core 2) and AMD (Athlon and Duron) microprocessors
Nvidia Grid, a set of hardware and services by Nvidia for graphics virtualization
Nvidia Shield, a range of gaming hardware including the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet and, most recently, the Shield Android TV
Nvidia Drive automotive solutions, a range of hardware and software products for assisting car drivers. The Drive PX-series is a high performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning,[45] while Driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars.[46]

Open-source software support[edit]
See also: Free and open-source device drivers: graphics, Mesa 3D, and nouveau (software)
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware,[47] meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and open-source device driver for its products without resorting to (clean room) reverse engineering.
Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and a thin open-source library that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[48]
The proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.[49] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers, and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as wholly inadequate, given that competing manufacturers (like Intel) offer support and documentation for open-source developers, and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[50][51]
Because of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides x86/x64 driver builds.[52] As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on PowerPC does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the hypervisor-restricted PlayStation 3 console.
Some users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[53]
Deep learning[edit]
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, artificial intelligence, and accelerated analytics. The company developed GPU-based deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection, weather prediction, and self-driving vehicles.[54] They are included in all Tesla vehicles.[55] The purpose is to help networks learn to “think”.[56] According to TechRepublic, Nvidia GPUs “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing, and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning.”[57] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[58] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).”[59] That year, the Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[60]
In April 2016 Nvidia produced the DGX-1 supercomputer based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[61] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[62] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS’s P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[63] called IBM PowerAI.[64][65] Nvidia also offers its own NVIDIA Deep Learning software development kit. [66] In 2017 the GPUs were also brought online at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[67] The company’s deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[68]

Nvidia Corporation (/ɪnˈvɪdiə/ in-VID-eeə)[5] (most commonly referred to as Nvidia, stylized as NVIDIA, nVIDIA or nvidia) is an American technology company based in Santa Clara, California. It designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SOCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Its primary GPU product line, labeled "GeForce", is in direct competition with Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) "Radeon" products. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld SHIELD Portable, SHIELD Tablet and SHIELD Android TV.
Since 2014, Nvidia has shifted to become a platform company focused on four markets – gaming, professional visualization, data centers and auto.
In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[6][7] More recently, It has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[8][9][10] In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel, Qualcomm and ARM (e.g., because of Denver, while Nvidia also licenses ARM's designs).
Nvidia is now focused on artificial intelligence.[11]

Company history[edit]
The name of the company comes from Invidia in Roman mythology who corresponds to Nemesis.[12]
Founders and initial investment[edit]
Three people co-founded Nvidia in April 1993:[13][14]

Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2017), a Taiwanese-born American, previously Director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Chris Malachowsky, an electrical engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems
Curtis Priem, previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at Sun Microsystems

The founders received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[15]
Major releases and acquisitions[edit]





This section may be too long and excessively detailed. Please consider summarizing the material while citing sources as needed. (December 2016)


RIVA TNT in 1998 solidified Nvidia's reputation for capable hardware.
Late 1999 saw the release of the GeForce 256 (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.
Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000.
In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from mid 1990s until 2000.[16][17] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[18]
In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[19]
In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[20]
On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[21]
In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. In May 2005, Microsoft chose to license a design by ATI and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the Xbox 360 graphics hardware, as had Nintendo for the Wii console (which succeeded the ATI-based Nintendo GameCube).[22]
On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[23]
In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[24]
In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[25]
Forbes magazine named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous 5 years.[26]
On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[27]
In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[28][29]
In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had "abnormal failure rates" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[30][31]
On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[32]
In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-chip for mobile devices. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[33][34]
In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[35]
In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system-on-chip.[36]
On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[citation needed]
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GeForce 10 series GPUs, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[37][38][39]
In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of RAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[40]
In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota will use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[41]
In July 2017, NVIDIA Corporation and Chinese search giant Baidu, Inc. announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI supercomputer will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform. [42]
GPU Technology Conference[edit]
The GPU Technology Conference is an annual technical conference started by Nvidia in 2009 which focuses on using the GPU to solve computing challenges.[43] In 2015, the conference attracted over 4000 attendees.[44]
Product families[edit]




The Nvidia GTX 1070 video card, which uses a 16 nm Pascal chip and was first released in June 2016.


Nvidia's family includes primarily graphics, wireless communication, PC processors and automotive hardware/software. Some families are listed below:

GeForce, consumer-oriented graphics processing products
Quadro computer-aided design and digital content creation workstation graphics processing products
NVS, multi-display business graphics solution
Tegra, a system on a chip series for mobile devices
Tesla, dedicated general purpose GPU for high-end image generation applications in professional and scientific fields
nForce, a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia for Intel (Celeron, Pentium and Core 2) and AMD (Athlon and Duron) microprocessors
Nvidia Grid, a set of hardware and services by Nvidia for graphics virtualization
Nvidia Shield, a range of gaming hardware including the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet and, most recently, the Shield Android TV
Nvidia Drive automotive solutions, a range of hardware and software products for assisting car drivers. The Drive PX-series is a high performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning,[45] while Driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars.[46]

Open-source software support[edit]
See also: Free and open-source device drivers: graphics, Mesa 3D, and nouveau (software)
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware,[47] meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and open-source device driver for its products without resorting to (clean room) reverse engineering.
Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and a thin open-source library that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[48]
The proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.[49] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers, and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as wholly inadequate, given that competing manufacturers (like Intel) offer support and documentation for open-source developers, and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[50][51]
Because of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides x86/x64 driver builds.[52] As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on PowerPC does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the hypervisor-restricted PlayStation 3 console.
Some users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[53]
Deep learning[edit]
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, artificial intelligence, and accelerated analytics. The company developed GPU-based deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection, weather prediction, and self-driving vehicles.[54] They are included in all Tesla vehicles.[55] The purpose is to help networks learn to “think”.[56] According to TechRepublic, Nvidia GPUs “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing, and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning.”[57] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[58] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).”[59] That year, the Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[60]
In April 2016 Nvidia produced the DGX-1 supercomputer based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[61] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[62] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS’s P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[63] called IBM PowerAI.[64][65] Nvidia also offers its own NVIDIA Deep Learning software development kit. [66] In 2017 the GPUs were also brought online at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[67] The company’s deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[68]

Nvidia Corporation (/ɪnˈvɪdiə/ in-VID-eeə)[5] (most commonly referred to as Nvidia, stylized as NVIDIA, nVIDIA or nvidia) is an American technology company based in Santa Clara, California. It designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SOCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Its primary GPU product line, labeled "GeForce", is in direct competition with Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) "Radeon" products. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld SHIELD Portable, SHIELD Tablet and SHIELD Android TV.
Since 2014, Nvidia has shifted to become a platform company focused on four markets – gaming, professional visualization, data centers and auto.
In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[6][7] More recently, It has moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[8][9][10] In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel, Qualcomm and ARM (e.g., because of Denver, while Nvidia also licenses ARM's designs).
Nvidia is now focused on artificial intelligence.[11]

Company history[edit]
The name of the company comes from Invidia in Roman mythology who corresponds to Nemesis.[12]
Founders and initial investment[edit]
Three people co-founded Nvidia in April 1993:[13][14]

Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2017), a Taiwanese-born American, previously Director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Chris Malachowsky, an electrical engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems
Curtis Priem, previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at Sun Microsystems

The founders received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[15]
Major releases and acquisitions[edit]





This section may be too long and excessively detailed. Please consider summarizing the material while citing sources as needed. (December 2016)


RIVA TNT in 1998 solidified Nvidia's reputation for capable hardware.
Late 1999 saw the release of the GeForce 256 (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.
Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000.
In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from mid 1990s until 2000.[16][17] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[18]
In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[19]
In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[20]
On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[21]
In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. In May 2005, Microsoft chose to license a design by ATI and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the Xbox 360 graphics hardware, as had Nintendo for the Wii console (which succeeded the ATI-based Nintendo GameCube).[22]
On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[23]
In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[24]
In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[25]
Forbes magazine named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous 5 years.[26]
On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[27]
In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[28][29]
In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had "abnormal failure rates" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[30][31]
On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[32]
In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-chip for mobile devices. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[33][34]
In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[35]
In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system-on-chip.[36]
On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[citation needed]
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GeForce 10 series GPUs, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[37][38][39]
In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of RAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[40]
In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota will use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[41]
In July 2017, NVIDIA Corporation and Chinese search giant Baidu, Inc. announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI supercomputer will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform. [42]
GPU Technology Conference[edit]
The GPU Technology Conference is an annual technical conference started by Nvidia in 2009 which focuses on using the GPU to solve computing challenges.[43] In 2015, the conference attracted over 4000 attendees.[44]
Product families[edit]




The Nvidia GTX 1070 video card, which uses a 16 nm Pascal chip and was first released in June 2016.


Nvidia's family includes primarily graphics, wireless communication, PC processors and automotive hardware/software. Some families are listed below:

GeForce, consumer-oriented graphics processing products
Quadro computer-aided design and digital content creation workstation graphics processing products
NVS, multi-display business graphics solution
Tegra, a system on a chip series for mobile devices
Tesla, dedicated general purpose GPU for high-end image generation applications in professional and scientific fields
nForce, a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia for Intel (Celeron, Pentium and Core 2) and AMD (Athlon and Duron) microprocessors
Nvidia Grid, a set of hardware and services by Nvidia for graphics virtualization
Nvidia Shield, a range of gaming hardware including the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet and, most recently, the Shield Android TV
Nvidia Drive automotive solutions, a range of hardware and software products for assisting car drivers. The Drive PX-series is a high performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning,[45] while Driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars.[46]

Open-source software support[edit]
See also: Free and open-source device drivers: graphics, Mesa 3D, and nouveau (software)
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware,[47] meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and open-source device driver for its products without resorting to (clean room) reverse engineering.
Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and a thin open-source library that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[48]
The proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.[49] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers, and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as wholly inadequate, given that competing manufacturers (like Intel) offer support and documentation for open-source developers, and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[50][51]
Because of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides x86/x64 driver builds.[52] As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on PowerPC does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the hypervisor-restricted PlayStation 3 console.
Some users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[53]
Deep learning[edit]
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, artificial intelligence, and accelerated analytics. The company developed GPU-based deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection, weather prediction, and self-driving vehicles.[54] They are included in all Tesla vehicles.[55] The purpose is to help networks learn to “think”.[56] According to TechRepublic, Nvidia GPUs “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing, and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning.”[57] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[58] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).”[59] That year, the Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create Deep Neural Networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[60]
In April 2016 Nvidia produced the DGX-1 supercomputer based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[61] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[62] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS’s P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[63] called IBM PowerAI.[64][65] Nvidia also offers its own NVIDIA Deep Learning software development kit. [66] In 2017 the GPUs were also brought online at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[67] The company’s deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[68]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
