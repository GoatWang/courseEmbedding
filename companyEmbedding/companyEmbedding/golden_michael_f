Michael F. Golden

When Michael Golden took over as CEO of Smith & Wesson in 2004, he faced a bleak situation. The world-famous revolver brand had been shooting blanks while competitors stole markets and opportunities went untargeted.   Under Golden’s leadership, Smith & Wesson has improved marketing, introduced new product lines such as rifles and shotguns, and acquired companies to expand into new markets, such as perimeter security. Here, he shares the leadership methods that he relied on throughout this remarkable turnaround.
