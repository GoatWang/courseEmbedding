      To whom it may concern
    

      July 27, 2017
    

      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (Securities Code: 8309 TSE, NSE) Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited
    

      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co., Ltd.
    

      Notice regarding Basic Policy for the Split and Integration of Asset Management Functions
    

      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (President: Tetsuo Ohkubo) hereby announces that it has decided on the basic policy for the split of asset management functions from Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited (President: Masaru Hashimoto, hereinafter "SuMi TRUST"), and the integration of aforementioned functions with the related Group company, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co., Ltd. (President: Hideki Hiraki, hereinafter "SuMi TRUST AM") (the "Business Split and Integration"), with the purpose of strengthening the asset management business, which is positioned as a growth business for the Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group.
    

      Further, as a preparatory step for the Business Split and Integration, we will segregate as a business within the company, the asset management business of SuMi TRUST, which is to be the subject of the split and integration, and we will commence concrete initiatives, beginning with formulation of growth strategies.
    


          Background to the Business Split and Integration
        

          With the continued harsh asset management environment of low interest rates worldwide, and increasing price volatility in a wide-range of assets, etc., for clients of all sizes, from individuals and corporations to institutional investors, there are increasing expectations on asset management companies to provide stable and high-quality investment returns, and the provision of products that contribute to future asset-formation primarily through medium- to long-term investment has become an important social mission for asset management companies.
        

          In addition, as a further social mission, asset management companies are urged to contribute to Japan's economic growth through sophistication of the investment chain, by providing growth capital through asset management products and making sustainable improvements to corporate value through constructive dialogue.
        

          In order to meet these expectations, SuMi TRUST, which has been providing services for corporate and institutional investors for many years, will split its asset management functions, which
        

          feature high-level know-how and quality, and strategically integrate aforementioned functions with SuMi TRUST AM, which has been aiming to expand its business from individual investors, focusing on defined contribution pensions, fund wraps, and index trusts, etc. We aim to concentrate and proactively allocate our management resources to growth areas.
        



          Vision for the New Company
        

          As a new asset management company that boasts of being among the largest in scale in Japan, the new company will focus on development of asset management products that will allow clients to entrust, with peace of mind, their medium- to long-term asset formation, and will aim to be an asset management company that has nationally well-known brand power, with recognition from many clients that "SuMi TRUST AM is the most reliable partner in medium- to long-term investment".
        

          The new company will aim to thoroughly strengthen its asset management capabilities, and it will be equipped with an extensive line-up that is responsive to the broad-range of investor needs, and will pursue the maximization of client profits by responding swiftly to the various client needs.
        

          Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group, as a financial group specialized in trust banking, has as its management philosophy, the fulfillment of "trustee's responsibilities" - which are the origin of fiduciary duties. In this specific matter of the split and integration of the asset management business, in order to contribute to business conduct that is still more thoroughly client-oriented, and the improvement of management independence and transparency, the new company intends to continue to enhance its corporate governance framework through measures such as, for example, actively inviting external experts with high-level knowledge to serve as independent external directors.
        



          Schedule for the Business Split and Integration
        


      For the Business Split and Integration, we will, effective on August 1, 2017, implement business segregation within the company regarding the asset management operations relating to the fiduciary services business of SuMi TRUST, which is to be the subject of the integration, and we will commence concrete preparations.
    

      Based on detailed review and discussions, and subject to matters such as necessary resolutions of the board of directors and the shareholder of each company, and filings with the relevant Japanese and overseas authorities, and approvals, we will aim for integration during Fiscal Year 2018.

What are analysts saying about Caterpillar stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Caterpillar stock: 
1. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "hard to imagine a robust surge" in the near term. Nevertheless, the mining and energy sector as a whole has "passed the lows," and the company is well positioned to capitalize on its status as a leader in capital equipment and engines — when an upturn eventually arrives.Meanwhile, Caterpillar's cost-cutting initiatives, headcount reductions, improved sourcing and shuttering or consolidating more than 30 factories will reduce fixed costs by nearly $2 billion, the analyst continued. Also, the company can save another $750 million from the closings of two factories in Belgium and Illinois while incentive compensation fell by more than $1 billion since peaking in 2014 at $1.3 billion.Last, Caterpillar's new CEO Jim Umpleby is likely to focus on profitability, free cash flow, and returns as opposed to the recent CEO Doug Oberhelman who focused on penetrating new markets and gaining market share. As such, the company should now be viewed as "a whole different animal." (7/24/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Caterpillar’s May sales rose 8%, an improvement from 1% growth witnessed in the last two months thanks to continual improvement in Asia Pacific. It remains to be seen whether this momentum will be sustained as even though commodity prices have improved lately, it is not sufficient to drive a relevant increase in short-term demand for new equipment. Caterpillar guides revenues in the range of $38–$41 billion and earnings of $3.75 per share for 2017, a 2% and 10% year–over-year growth, respectively. In construction, Asia Pacific is showing promise while leading indicators of U.S. construction signal robust conditions ahead. The company’s efforts to reduce costs will help boost margins. Year to date, the stock has outperformed the Zacks sub industry. Also, it has a positive record of earnings surprises." (7/14/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Cost cuts continue to benefit margins despite ongoing market weakness. 4Q16 earnings, ex. adjustments, were better than expected on favorable decremental margins in Construction and E&T versus modeled expectations. With FX remaining a headwind CAT lowered the mid-point of the 2017 revenue guide to $37.5bln (prior: ~$38bln) resulting in EPS of $2.90 (Consensus: $3.06). Shares continue to trade above 30x earnings, a premium to prior cycles." (1/27/2017)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 10 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.41)Consensus Price Target: $103.06 (9.67% downside)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
