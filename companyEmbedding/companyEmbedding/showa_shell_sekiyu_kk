Business Overview






Showa Shell Sekiyu Group's goal is to support its customers and society as an energy solutions provider supplying safe and sustainable energy, with Oil and Energy Solutions Business as its two main businesses.

Through partnerships with the Shell Group and Saudi Aramco, the latter of which is a major shareholder, we refine crude oil imported from around the world at Group refineries in Japan (Yokkaichi, Keihin, and Yamaguchi; crude oil processing capacity: 445,000 barrels/day), and sell to customers such products as gasoline and diesel oil  mainly at about 3,200 (as of Dec 31, 2015) service stations (SS) and through other marketing channels in Japan. In addition, we sell oil products including industrial fuels, LPG, chemicals, lubricants, and bitumen, and utilize the Shell Group's global network to export oil products.

● Energy Solutions Business

Our 100% subsidiary, Solar Frontier K.K. is operating the business.ăIt has been developing its proprietary next-generation CIS thin-film solar cell technology and manufacturing the solar panels with its total annual production capacity of over 1,000MW (1GW).

Corporate Social Responsibility







In accordance with its Management Philosophy, the Showa Shell Group aims to cooperate with its stakeholders and become the energy solutions provider that society and its customers require. We consider activities that lead to achieving this objective to be our corporate social responsibility (CSR). Accordingly, from 2012 we have consolidated our Annual Report and Sustainability Report, previously published separately, into a single "Corporate Report" to present the Group's management and corporate activities in a more easily understood format. 
Corporate Report
The "CSR Book" provides a more detailed account of non-financial information related to CSR and other activities presented in our "Corporate Report".

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
In 1900, Samuel Samuel & Co, which had started in Japan in 1876 by Samuel Samuel as an international trading business in Yokohama, created an independent petroleum division. It subsequently set up Rising Sun Petroleum Co. Ltd (which later became Shell Petroleum) to expand its distribution channels of candles and kerosene for lamps.
Before long, Samuel Samuel & Co, which expanded as Shell Transport, merged with Royal Dutch to form Royal Dutch/Shell. Rising Sun Petroleum continued to expand its operations as the base of the Shell Group in Japan.
At the same time, oilfields were discovered in Japan along the coast of the Japan Sea primarily in Niigata Prefecture. Hayama Sekiyu and Niitsu Sekiyu, the predecessors of Showa Sekiyu, were established amidst the production of domestic petroleum.
20th century[edit]
In 1947, Rising Sun Petroleum was renamed Shell Sekiyu and resumed business. Starting with a capital agreement between the Shell Group and Showa Sekiyu, domestic oil companies deepened the collaboration with foreign oil companies, and before long were preparing to be a key industry to support the energy needs of the impending recovery period.
Shell Sekiyu and Showa Sekiyu, which had played crucial roles since the dawn of Japan's oil industry, merged in 1985 to form Showa Shell Sekiyu.

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
In 1900, Samuel Samuel & Co, which had started in Japan in 1876 by Samuel Samuel as an international trading business in Yokohama, created an independent petroleum division. It subsequently set up Rising Sun Petroleum Co. Ltd (which later became Shell Petroleum) to expand its distribution channels of candles and kerosene for lamps.
Before long, Samuel Samuel & Co, which expanded as Shell Transport, merged with Royal Dutch to form Royal Dutch/Shell. Rising Sun Petroleum continued to expand its operations as the base of the Shell Group in Japan.
At the same time, oilfields were discovered in Japan along the coast of the Japan Sea primarily in Niigata Prefecture. Hayama Sekiyu and Niitsu Sekiyu, the predecessors of Showa Sekiyu, were established amidst the production of domestic petroleum.
20th century[edit]
In 1947, Rising Sun Petroleum was renamed Shell Sekiyu and resumed business. Starting with a capital agreement between the Shell Group and Showa Sekiyu, domestic oil companies deepened the collaboration with foreign oil companies, and before long were preparing to be a key industry to support the energy needs of the impending recovery period.
Shell Sekiyu and Showa Sekiyu, which had played crucial roles since the dawn of Japan's oil industry, merged in 1985 to form Showa Shell Sekiyu.
Business[edit]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

It subsequently set up Rising Sun Petroleum Co. Ltd (which later became Shell Petroleum) to expand its distribution channels of candles and kerosene for lamps.
Before long, Samuel Samuel & Co, which expanded as Shell Transport, merged with Royal Dutch to form Royal Dutch/Shell. Rising Sun Petroleum continued to expand its operations as the base of the Shell Group in Japan.
At the same time, oilfields were discovered in Japan along the coast of the Japan Sea primarily in Niigata Prefecture. Hayama Sekiyu and Niitsu Sekiyu, the predecessors of Showa Sekiyu, were established amidst the production of domestic petroleum.
20th century[edit]
In 1947, Rising Sun Petroleum was renamed Shell Sekiyu and resumed business. Starting with a capital agreement between the Shell Group and Showa Sekiyu, domestic oil companies deepened the collaboration with foreign oil companies, and before long were preparing to be a key industry to support the energy needs of the impending recovery period.
Shell Sekiyu and Showa Sekiyu, which had played crucial roles since the dawn of Japan's oil industry, merged in 1985 to form Showa Shell Sekiyu.

Submit      Top searches   Your recent searches                                 Our business    There are currently three companies using the Shell brand in Japan: Shell Japan Ltd., Shell Chemicals and the publicly listed company Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. Shell Japan looks after Integrated Gas business and Project & Technology.                 Shell Japan Ltd.              Integrated Gas & New Energies In Integrated Gas and New Energies, we focus on liquefying natural gas (LNG) and converting gas to liquids (GTL) so that it can be safely stored and shipped to markets around the world. The New Energies business has been established to explore and invest in new low-carbon opportunities. Today, more than ever, energy powers human civilisation. At the same time, the world needs to mitigate the threat of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. An affordable, environmentally acceptable and technically proven option to power and sustain people’s lives is to increase the world’s reliance on natural gas, the cleanest-burning fossil fuel. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Shell has been a pioneer in liquefied natural gas (LNG) for more than 50 years. In 2015, Shell sold 22.6mt of equity LNG globally, which is about a 9% share of global LNG sales. In 2015, Japan imported a total of 85mtpa of LNG, which is about 35% of globally traded LNG. Shell is a leading LNG provider to Japan and has been supplying the country through joint venture projects such as Brunei LNG, North West Shelf, Malaysia LNG, Oman LNG and Sakhalin Energy, as well as directly from Shell’s portfolio of LNG. Shell works with Japanese partners across both Upstream and LNG, and Shell Japan coordinates a wide range of activities between Shell and these partners. Visit Shell global LNG website New Business Development Shell Japan is working closely with a wide range of Shell businesses and Japanese companies in pursuing new business opportunities. These include LNG for transport projects and identifying new market opportunities for GTL products.
