FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Nasdaq Composite ventures under the 50-day average, retest underway 
U.S. stocks are lower early Thursday, pressured against the backdrop of a headline technical test.  Specifically, the Nasdaq Composite is back for its latest crack at the 50-day moving average â currently 6,150 â an area that initially underpinned the early-week downdraft.  As a widely-tracked intermediate-term trending indicator, this area marks a bull-bear inflection point.

					Full Description



SAGE Therapeutics, Inc., incorporated on April 16, 2010, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in developing and commercializing medicines to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The Company's lead product candidate, SAGE-547 is an intravenous formulation of allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that acts as a synaptic and extrasynaptic modulator of the Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid-A (GABAA) receptor. The Company's next-generation product candidates, SAGE-217 and SAGE-689, also target the GABAA receptor system. The Company is focused on developing drugs based on selective allosteric modulation of CNS synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. The Company's chemistry platform is focused on chemical scaffolds of endogenous or chemically modified synthetic neuroactive steroid compounds that are allosteric modulators of GABAA or N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid or N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.SAGE-547The Company's SAGE-547 is an intravenous (IV) formulation of allopregnanolone, which is a neurosteroid that acts as a synaptic and extrasynaptic modulator of the GABAA receptor. SAGE-547 is being developed as an adjunctive therapy in conjunction with underlying anesthesia as a treatment for super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE). The Company is conducting SAGE-547 Treatment as Adjunctive Therapy Utilized in Status Epilepticus (STATUS) Phase III trials.SAGE-217The Company's product SAGE-217 is a neuroactive steroid that is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. SAGE-217 targets synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. The Company is conducting Phase I clinical trials. SAGE-217 is being studied as an oral solution. The Company in the process of developing a solid dosage formulation of SAGE-217 intended for chronic use.SAGE-689The Company's SAGE-689 is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. SAGE-689 has shown anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and sedative properties in animal models. The characteristics of SAGE-689 include a therapeutic window to allow for modulation of the GABAA receptor without inducing deep anesthesia, and a short half-life to permit onset and loss of activity.SAGE-718The Company's SAGE-718 is a product candidate selected for development from its NMDA receptor program. SAGE-718 is an oxysterol-based positive allosteric modulator of NMDA receptors. SAGE-718 has been designed to be a potent and selective modulator of NMDA receptors with an optimized pharmacokinetic profile intended to support oral dosing. The Company has begun non-clinical studies of SAGE-718, with an initial development focus on two conditions, Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) and Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis (ANRE). SLOS is a metabolic disorder caused by a mutation in the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) gene, which codes for an enzyme that is involved in the production of cholesterol in the brain. ANRE is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies attack NMDA receptors. Symptoms of ANRE include a set of neuropsychiatric deficits, including cognitive and behavioral disturbances, movement disorders and loss of consciousness.The Company competes with Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Nasdaq Composite ventures under the 50-day average, retest underway 
U.S. stocks are lower early Thursday, pressured against the backdrop of a headline technical test.  Specifically, the Nasdaq Composite is back for its latest crack at the 50-day moving average â currently 6,150 â an area that initially underpinned the early-week downdraft.  As a widely-tracked intermediate-term trending indicator, this area marks a bull-bear inflection point.
