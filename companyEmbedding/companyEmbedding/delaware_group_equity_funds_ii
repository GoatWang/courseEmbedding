Q: HOW WOULD THE BROAD-BASED PROPOSALS AFFECT ME AS A FUND SHAREHOLDER?



o  Changing the designation of a fund's investment objective from "fundamental"
to "non-fundamental" will not alter any fund's current investment
objective, but it will allow a fund's Board to make future adjustments to
the investment objective without having to obtain shareholder approval.
Shareholders would, however, receive advance written notice of any proposed
changes. Management does not currently intend to recommend any material
changes to the investment objective of any fund.


o  Adopting a standardized list of "fundamental" investment restrictions across
all funds would modernize the restrictions to meet all current regulatory
requirements and would provide operational efficiencies and make it easier
to monitor compliance with these restrictions.


o  Designating all existing investment restrictions as "non-fundamental" would
not change the way a fund is currently managed or operated, but would allow
a fund's Board to analyze and approve changes to the fund's existing
investment restrictions, without having to obtain additional shareholder
approval. Over time, management expects to recommend that the Board
evaluate each fund's investment restrictions so that those restrictions can
be modernized and standardized, if appropriate.


o  Approval of the proposed fee increases, fee decreases or potential fee
decreases through the introduction of breakpoints for certain funds would
ensure management fee levels that will enable those funds to have
competitive fee structures and continue to receive high quality investment
management services.


o  Approval of new standardized investment management agreements for each fund
(and standardized sub-advisory agreements where applicable) would help
provide operational efficiencies.


o  The restructuring of funds from their current form of organization into
Delaware business trusts would provide both consistency across the Delaware
Investments fund family and greater flexibility of fund operations.



Q: HOW DO THE BOARD MEMBERS FOR MY FUND RECOMMEND THAT I VOTE?



The Board members for all the funds recommend that you vote in favor of, or
FOR, all of the proposals described above.



Q: WHOM DO I CALL FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOW TO PLACE MY VOTE?



Please call your fund at 1-800-523-1918 for additional information on how to
place your vote.



PLEASE VOTE

Dear Shareholder                                                                

"AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2000, THE U.S. STOCK MARKET HAD JUST TURNED IN A THIRD      
CONSECUTIVE MONTH OF LACKLUSTER RETURNS, AND THE EQUITY MARKETS WERE ON THEIR   
WAY TO FINISHING THEIR WORST YEAR SINCE 1990."                                  
January 9, 2001                                                                 

Recap of Events -- As of November 30, 2000, the U.S. stock market had just      
turned in a third consecutive month of lackluster returns, and the equity       
markets were on their way to finishing their worst year since 1990. Major U.S.  
equity indexes were down year to date, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq         
Composite Index off a notable 36.16% year to date and almost 50% from its March 
10th peak.                                                                      

There are a number of factors arguably contributing to the troubles, including  
high oil prices, tensions in the Middle East, corporate earnings                
disappointments, and tightening by an inflation-wary U.S. Federal Reserve Board 
early in 2000.                                                                  

It is also clear that many investors and analysts in 2000 began reassessing     
stock valuations for companies that play a role in the New Economy. In December 
1999 and through the first two months of 2000, growth stocks were completing a  
monumental price boom that was often led by hopeful prospects for technology,   
and in particular for Internet-related companies. The rest of 2000 was a reverse
image of that speculative environment, however. Many technology stocks lost     
significant value in the spring, leading the broad market downward. The entire  
market has generally been volatile ever since and, as a result, we have seen an 
increased focus on corporate fundamentals as the year has progressed. We believe
this newfound focus on fundamentals can be a positive development, as it helps  
move stocks toward values from which we can be optimistic about future returns. 

Delaware Blue Chip Fund, by definition of its investment strategy, focuses on   
stocks that have both growth and value characteristics. It holds stocks from a  
diverse array of industries, including banking, energy, healthcare, technology, 
and telecommunications.                                                         

The Fund focuses on "blue chip" companies -- those with large market            
capitalizations that typically have lengthy records of profit growth, sound     
management teams, and reputations for quality products and services.            

Total Return

All performance shown above is at net asset value without the effect of sales   
charges and assumes reinvestment of all distributions. Performance for all Fund 
classes can be found on page 5. In the past, the Fund's benchmark was the S&P   
500 Index, which measures the performance of mostly large-capitalization U.S.   
companies. The Fund now uses the Russell Top 200 Index as its benchmark because 
it more accurately represents the investment strategy of Delaware Blue Chip     
Fund. The Russell Top 200 Index measures the largest 200 companies in the       
Russell 1000 Index. The Russell 1000 Index measures the 1,000 largest companies 
in the Russell 3000 Index, which measures the performance of the largest 3,000  
companies in the U.S. All of the indexes are unmanaged. You cannot invest       
directly in an index. The Lipper category represents the average of all         
multi-cap core funds tracked by Lipper (Source: Lipper Inc.). Past performance  
is not a guarantee of future results.

"WE BELIEVE THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS CURRENTLY ACHIEVING THE SOFT LANDING IT 
SOUGHT FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY, AND THAT INVESTORS' VARIOUS CONCERNS ARE ALREADY   
REFLECTED IN THE MARKET."                                                       

Your Fund returned -8.64% (Class A shares at net asset value with distributions 
reinvested) during the year ended November 30, 2000. Although the Fund's        
performance was disappointing, it managed to outperform its benchmark, the      
Russell Top 200 Index, which returned -13.55% for the same period.              

Difficult times in the stock market call for long-term mutual fund investors to 
remain disciplined. Down markets can represent opportunities. We believe that   
investors who stick to a regular investment plan, diversify their assets, and   
keep a long-term outlook are generally well prepared, regardless of short-term  
market direction. As always, we recommend that investors continue to rely on    
basic, sound principles of investing. For help with your financial plan, or with

Market Outlook -- The factors mentioned above as contributing to this year's    
market woes are almost identical to those seen in 1990. That year was the last  
in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq Composite Index, and the  
S&P 500 Index all finished down for the year.                                   

The difference is that in 1990 the U.S. economy was in recession. We believe    
that the Federal Reserve is currently achieving the soft landing it sought for  
the U.S. economy, and that investors' various concerns are already reflected in 
the market. Although we expect market volatility may continue, it is our opinion
that declining stock prices, positive fundamentals, and a healthy economic      
backdrop make the current environment for equity investing quite attractive.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT REVIEW                                                     
---------------------------                                                     

The Fund's Results                                                              
Delaware Blue Chip Fund returned -8.64% for the year ended November 30, 2000    
(Class A shares at net asset value with distributions reinvested). The Fund     
outperformed its benchmark, the Russell Top 200 Index, which returned -13.55%   
for the same period.                                                            

By its nature, the Fund allocates a good portion of its portfolio to stocks of  
large technology and growth companies which were especially hard hit by the     
volatile market conditions. We seek out companies with a history of profit      
growth and shareholder dividends. We use a combination of quantitative models   
and fundamental research to pick what we believe are undervalued or mispriced   
securities. We also attempt to maintain an allocation that generally reflects   
the overall market's composition.                                               

A primary reason the Fund performed below our expectations was our investment in
large technology companies which were especially hard hit by the volatile market
conditions. Following strong performance for large technology and growth stocks 
early in 2000, the tide turned and many large growth stocks -- particularly blue
chip technology stocks -- fell sharply. However, because the Fund is well       
diversified (140 holdings as of November 30, 2000) and does not hold a high     
percentage of stocks in any particular sector, the negative impact from the     
technology sector was somewhat minimized.                                       

Portfolio Highlights                                                            
Apple Computer, Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard were among the stocks that had
the greatest impact on the Fund's performance. Both Apple and Dell fell         
substantially in price during the latter half of our fiscal year as revenues and
earnings projections began to fall for computer manufacturers.                  

Other PC-related stocks hurt performance as well during the period, including   
Micron Technology and Microsoft. Microsoft's price dropped quite precipitously  
when the company lost its anti-trust case.                                      

Poor performance in the technology sector was partially offset by a solid       
showing by some brokerage stocks, as the financial industry was dominated by    
merger and acquisition activity. In addition to actual acquisitions, speculation
about possible deals caused other stocks to rise. We were fortunate to own      
PaineWebber, which was acquired by Swiss financial giant, UBS Warburg, as well  
as A. G. Edwards, whose stock price rose in relation to brokerage stocks        
overall, but which remained independent. We sold our position in PaineWebber in 
July 2000, however, after the announcement of the takeover.                     

                                                                               3

As of November 30, 2000

Other 12.88%

Capital Goods 6.03%                                                             

Electronics & Electrical Equipment 6.13%                                        

Telecommunications 8.41%                                                        

One area where our performance was enhanced by holding a smaller percentage of  
stocks was long-distance telecommunication stocks. These stocks generally       
performed particularly poorly, especially AT&T and WorldCom. Some media stocks  
in the portfolio also turned in disappointing performance, including Walt Disney
and Time Warner. Time Warner started the period very positively after the       
announcement that it would be acquired by America Online, but the stock faltered
later in the year.                                                              

Within consumer staples, Quaker Oats and Best Foods benefited from acquisition  
interest by PepsiCo and Unilever, respectively, with prices rising from the time
a takeover was first rumored. These were cases in which we bought stocks because
they were fundamentally attractive and then benefited from acquisitions.        

Market Outlook                                                                  
Because many blue chip stocks have suffered declines in the past few months, we 
view them as well positioned for future growth. While the accumulated impact of 
higher energy prices, interest rates, and uncertainty about the direction of the
U.S. economy have caused some softness in prices and earnings, we believe       
economic fundamentals are still sound. We expect the Fund to benefit over the   
long term from our technology holdings. We also see good opportunities in the   
healthcare sector.                                                              

We remain committed to our disciplined, objective approach to selecting stocks  
with potential for long-term growth as we believe this strategy positions us to 
take advantage of new market opportunities as they arise.

Returns reflect the reinvestment of distributions and, where indicated, any     
applicable sales charges as noted below. Returns and share values will fluctuate
so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original    
cost. Class B and C share results, excluding sales charges, assume either that  
contingent deferred sales charges did not apply or the investment was not       
redeemed. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.                

Class A shares have a 5.75% maximum front-end sales charge and an annual        
distribution and service fee not to exceed 0.30%.                               

Class B shares do not have a front-end sales charge, but are subject to a 1%    
annual distribution and service fee. They are also subject to a contingent      
deferred sales charge of up to 5% if redeemed before the end of the sixth year. 

Class C shares have a 1% annual distribution and service fee. If redeemed within
12 months, a 1% contingent deferred sales charge applies.                       

Average annual total returns for the lifetime and one-year periods ended        
November 30, 2000 for Delaware Blue Chip Fund's Institutional Class were +9.20% 
and -8.46%, respectively. The Institutional Class was originally made available 
without sales charges only to a certain eligible institutional accounts on      
February 24, 1997.                                                              

An expense limitation was in effect for all classes of Delaware Blue Chip Fund  
during the periods shown. Performance would have been lower if the expense      
limitation was not in effect.

Delaware Group Equity Funds II (the "Trust") is organized as a Delaware business
trust and offers five series: Delaware Blue Chip Fund, Delaware Decatur Equity  
Income Fund, Delaware Diversified Value Fund, Delaware Growth and Income Fund   
and Delaware Social Awareness Fund. These financial statements and related notes
pertain to Delaware Blue Chip Fund (the "Fund"). Delaware Blue Chip Fund is a   
diversified open-end investment company under the Investment Company Act of     
1940, as amended. The Fund offers four classes of shares. The A Class carries a 
maximum front-end sales charge of 5.75%. The B Class carries a back-end deferred
sales charge. The C Class carries a level load deferred sales charge and the    
Institutional Class has no sales charge.                                        

The Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation. Current income is a   
secondary objective.                                                            

1. Significant Accounting Policies                                              
The following accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles  
generally accepted in the United States and are consistently followed by the    
Fund.                                                                           

Security Valuation -- All equity securities are valued at the last quoted sales 
price as of the regular close of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the      
valuation date. If on a particular day an equity security does not trade, then  
the mean between the bid and asked prices will be used. Money market instruments
having less than 60 days to maturity are valued at amortized cost, which        
approximates market value. Other securities and assets for which market         
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in  
good faith under the direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees.                 

Federal Income Taxes -- The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated  
investment company and make the requisite distributions to shareholders.        
Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made in the         
financial statements. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in   
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.                             

Class Accounting -- Investment income, common expenses and realized and         
unrealized gain (loss) on investments are allocated to the various classes of   
the Fund on the basis of daily net assets of each class. Distribution expenses  
relating to a specific class are charged directly to that class.                

Repurchase Agreements -- The Fund may invest in a pooled cash account along with
other members of the Delaware Investments Family of Funds. The aggregate daily  
balance of the pooled cash account is invested in repurchase agreements secured 
by obligations of the U.S. government. The respective collateral is held by the 
Fund's custodian bank until the maturity of the respective repurchase           
agreements. Each repurchase agreement is 102% collateralized. However, in the   
event of default or bankruptcy by the counterparty to the agreement, realization
of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires          
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results    
could differ from those estimates.                                              

Other -- Expenses common to all funds within the Delaware Investments Family of 
Funds are allocated amongst the funds on the basis of average net assets.       
Security transactions are recorded on the date the securities are purchased or  
sold (trade date). Costs used in calculating realized gains and losses on the   
sale of investment securities are those of the specific securities sold.        
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and interest income is      
recorded on the accrual basis. The Fund declares and pays dividends from net    
investment income and capital gains, if any, annually.                          

Certain expenses of the Fund are paid through commission arrangements with      
brokers. These transactions are done subject to best execution. The amount of   
these expenses was approximately $1,227 for the year ended November 30, 2000. In
addition, the Fund receives earnings credits from its custodian when positive   
cash balances are maintained, which are used to offset custody fees. These      
credits were approximately $940 for the year ended November 30, 2000. The       
expenses paid under the above arrangements are included in their respective     
expense captions on the Statement of Operations with the corresponding expense  
offset shown as "Expenses paid indirectly".                                     

2. Investment Management and Other Transactions with Affiliates                 
In accordance with the terms of the investment management agreement, the Fund   
pays Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Delaware Management Business
Trust and the investment manager of the Fund, an annual fee which is calculated 
daily at the rate of 0.65% on the first $500 million of net assets of the Fund, 
0.60% on the next $500 million, 0.55% on the next $1.5 billion and 0.50% on the 
net assets in excess of $2.5 billion. At November 30, 2000, the Fund had a      
liability for investment management fees and other expenses payable to DMC of   
$2,416.                                                                         

For the year ended November 30, 2000, Vantage Investment Advisors, Inc., an     
affiliate of DMC, provided sub-advisory services to the Fund. For the services  
provided to DMC, DMC paid the sub-adviser an annual fee which was calculated at 
the rate of 0.15% of average daily net assets averaging one year old or less,   
0.20% of average daily net assets averaging two years or less but greater than  
one year old and 0.35% of average daily net assets averaging over two years old.
The Fund did not pay any fees to the sub-adviser.                               

The investment management capabilities of Vantage Investment Advisors, Inc. have
been consolidated into Delaware Management Business Trust as of January 1, 2001.
As a result, DMC and Vantage are part of the same entity and, because there no  
longer is a need for the Fund to have an adviser and a sub-adviser, DMC assumed 
full management of the Fund.                                                    

                                                                              13

2. Investment Management and Other Transactions with Affiliates                 
(continued)                                                               

DMC has elected to waive the portion, if any, of the management fee and         
reimburse the Fund to the extent that annual operating expenses exclusive of    
taxes, interest, brokerage commissions, distribution fees and extraordinary     
expenses exceed 1.25% of average daily net assets of the Fund through January
31, 2002.                                                                       

The Fund has engaged Delaware Service Company, Inc. (DSC), an affiliate of DMC, 
to provide dividend disbursing, transfer agent, accounting and administrative   
services. The Fund pays DSC a monthly fee based on the number of shareholder    
accounts, shareholder transactions and average net assets, subject to certain   
minimums. At November 30, 2000, the Fund had a liability for such fees and other
expenses payable to DSC of $25,044.                                             

Pursuant to the distribution agreement, the Fund pays Delaware Distributors,    
L.P. (DDLP), the distributor and an affiliate of DMC, an annual fee not to      
exceed 0.30% of the average daily net assets of the A Class and 1.00% of the    
average daily net assets of the B and C Classes. At November 30, 2000, the Fund 
had a liability for fees and other expenses payable to DDLP of $24,285.         

For the year ended November 30, 2000, DDLP earned $21,758 for commissions on    
sales of the Fund A Class shares.                                               

Certain officers of DMC, DSC and DDLP are officers, trustees and/or employees of
the Fund. These officers, trustees and employees are paid no compensation by the
Fund.                                                                           

3. Investments                                                                  
For the year ended November 30, 2000, the Fund made purchases of $56,643,095 and
sales of $34,696,106 of investment securities other than short-term investments.

At November 30, 2000, the aggregate cost of securities for federal income tax   
purposes was $54,683,917 and net unrealized depreciation for federal income tax 
purposes was $1,083,161 of which $6,747,435 related to unrealized appreciation  
of securities and $7,830,596 related to unrealized depreciation of securities.

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees                                       
Delaware Group Equity Funds II -- Delaware Blue Chip Fund                       

We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets of Delaware Blue Chip  
Fund (the "Fund") as of November 30, 2000, and the related statement of         
operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for 
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the three years in the period then ended and for the period February 24,
1997 (commencement of operations) through November 30, 1997. These financial    
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's        
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial      
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.                        

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and       
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes       
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included      
confirmation of securities owned as of November 30, 2000, by correspondence with
the custodian and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting      
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as        
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of       
Delaware Blue Chip Fund at November 30, 2000, the results of its operations for 
the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in 
the period then ended, and its financial highlights for each of the three years 
in the period then ended and for the period February 24, 1997 (commencement of  
operations) through November 30, 1997, in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States.

This annual report is for the information of Delaware Blue Chip Fund            
shareholders, but it may be used with prospective investors when preceded or    
accompanied by a current prospectus for Delaware Blue Chip Fund and the Delaware
Investments Performance Update for the most recently completed calendar quarter.
The prospectus sets forth details about charges, expenses, investment objectives
and operating policies of the Fund. You should read the prospectus carefully    
before you invest. The figures in this report represent past results which are  
not a guarantee of future results. The return and principal value of an         
investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be     
worth more or less than their original cost.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

VIEW MORE



Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
