J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) announced Friday the hiring of Therace Risch as its chief information officer.
Risch's role, formerly held by Scott Laverty, is effective immediately. She joins Plano-based Penney from the insurance company Country Financial, where she served as executive vice president and chief information officer. Her responsibilities included technology strategies and planning and overseeing data security.

Before joining Country Financial, Risch served in various roles with Target Corp.
"Therace is an outstanding (information technology) professional with an extensive background of merging innovative retail technologies and powerful applications to drive both brick-and-mortar and online growth," Marvin R. Ellison, J.C. Penney’s CEO, said in a news release. "We are pleased to blend her 20 years of experience with the recently announced leaders of e-commerce and supply chain to offer a seamless omnichannel shopping experience across multiple customer touch points."
Details of Risch's salary have not yet been disclosed.
In the release, Penney said Risch’s appointment “reinforces the company’s commitment to becoming a world-class omnichannel retailer.” Omnichannel refers to a customer’s ability to buy a company’s products by multiple methods, including online and in stores.
In August, J.C. Penney hired executive Michael Amend as executive vice president of omnichannel. Amend is the former vice president of online, mobile and omnichannel with Ellison’s former company, Home Depot. While there, Amend helped roll out pick-up in store, buy online, ship to store, buy online and deliver to store options.
Penney also hired Mike Robbins as its senior vice president of supply chain. Robbins previously held the same position with Target Corp.’s U.S. stores.




 


Ellison has repeatedly highlighted the importance of omnichannel shopping to J.C. Penney’s profitability. The company now offers Sephora cosmetic products online and is working on an Apple Watch app.
"We’re deeply passionate about an omnichannel experience that serves customers any way that they want to be served," Ellison said at a retailing conference in October. "We want to monetize every engagement with the customer so when he or she comes in, we offer them something that gives them the ability to solve a problem, fill a need and gets them excited about coming back."

As J.C. Penney’s chief information officer, Therace Risch is using technology to improve the company’s shopping experience in and out of stores.
Risch, who joined the Plano retailer in December, was brought on board to “reinforce the company’s commitment to becoming a world-class omnichannel retailer,” J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) said in an announcement of her hire.

Omnichannel refers to a customer’s ability to buy a company’s products by multiple methods, including online and in stores, and is one of three prongs in CEO Marvin Ellison’s plan to bring J.C. Penney back to profitability.
"Therace is an outstanding (information technology) professional with an extensive background of merging innovative retail technologies and powerful applications to drive both brick-and-mortar and online growth," Ellison said. "We are pleased to blend her 20 years of experience with the recently announced leaders of e-commerce and supply chain to offer a seamless omnichannel shopping experience across multiple customer touch points."
Since Risch stepped into the CIO role, the company has rolled out buy online, pick up in store same day capabilities and said in its first quarter earnings it is working on a new mobile app.
Risch also said she and her team are working on technology strategies that will help the retailer’s sales associates spend more time with customers.
And the company announced last month that it will build a global in-house center, or tech hub, in Bangaluru, India. Set to open on Aug. 22, it will eventually employ around 1,000 workers, 50 of which have already started. It will manage internal IT systems; develop digital, e-commerce and analytics solutions; and support J.C. Penney’s digital platform, with an emphasis on the company’s mobile capabilities.
Though some job functions will be transferred from J.C. Penney’s headquarters to the new center, most of the affected positions are contracted workers. J.C. Penney is looking to fill more than 50 IT positions at its Plano headquarters, the company added.
“Anyone who looks at what’s happening in the Dallas area sees so many companies are coming here and there’s a war on talent. And in the U.S. we have fewer and fewer people going into technology jobs,” Risch said of the company’s decision to open the Bengaluru hub. “Jobs will always be important here, but we need other markets we can go to, and (Bengaluru) is a huge tech hub.”

Before joining the company, Risch served as executive vice president and CIO of insurance company Country Financial, overseeing technology strategies and planning and data security.
She also has roughly 10 years of experience in retail, serving in various roles with Target Corp. before joining Country Financial.
She gave us more insight on her role at J.C. Penney and the strategies she’s spearheading.
Once you took over the position, what was the first thing you started working on?
The first thing I wanted to do when I came in was really understand the differences from the retail business that I had spent 10 years in and J.C. Penney, being a bit more of a department store. I spent quite a bit of time with my new peer group understanding the business strategy so I could make sure my team could support it.
And then I really spent time getting to know my team. My belief in IT is that it’s all about people, so I spent time with my direct reports, and then the next level down, and then pods below that to understand what we had in terms of culture, talent and workflow.
What initiatives are you working on now?
There’s been a lot of press about the work we’ve been doing with Oracle systems to support the merchandising part of our business. That really aligns with our omnichannel vision as we move all of our merchandising systems to one set of systems across the whole company.
The store area has been a big area of opportunity for us to make sure that we really have good performing systems. We focused extensively on point of sale, both hardware and software, and feel like we’re making a big impact for our stores. We are using a device we call a mobile warrior, which has a hip printer that goes with it that’s been a great productivity tool for our store associates. I work closely with (executive vice president of stores) Joe McFarland to prioritize the work and help him get his associates more on the sales floor than in the back rooms.
And then (I continue) to look at the type of technologies we need to enable more mobile device use within our stores, and that’s a lot of infrastructure work.
In what other ways do you contribute to J.C. Penney’s omnichannel strategy?




 


(Executive vice president of omnichannel) Mike Amend and I are basically joined at the hip. Mike is really focused on the website and mobile devices, and I help in a couple of ways. One is by making sure we’ve got really reliable infrastructure for his systems to work on top of.
And then his systems rely a lot on core systems that I’m responsible for, whether they be distribution, replenishment or pricing systems. I work in conjunction with him so that when we want to provide new capabilities to our customers, we can do that seamlessly.
We just finished rolling out buy online, pick up in store capabilities, and that was a joint effort between Mike and I, with my team making sure we have the right inventory connections.
How do you work with other J.C. Penney executives to shape the company’s strategy?
Marvin’s direct report team works really closely together. We spend hours together each week, specifically to make sure we’re aligned on strategies, whether they be omnichannel or making sure we have the right private brands.
I’m in every business meeting you can think of where we’re talking about strategies, thinking about how we’re going to execute them, so I can link back with my team and say, ‘This is the direction we’re going, what can we offer in terms of system support?’ Nothing really gets done in this day and age without having a tech solution.
How is J.C. Penney protecting against data breaches?
We had been building up our capabilities before I got here, and we’ve added some additional capabilities since I’ve come. For us, it’s really about making sure that we understand the risks and are staying close to other security organizations in peer companies and in other industries where we think there are collaboration points. We are leveraging partner organizations, (because) it’s a hard field to get top talent in. A lot of security people in technology like to go to the security companies rather than to businesses like us.
And we constantly have to be assessing what’s happening in our own environment and reacting to that. It’s just the world we live in.
What are your goals for your first year at J.C. Penney?
One is to make sure we have the right staffing levels across our functions. We’ve had a lot of shakeups with staffing over the last couple of years, and now is the time to slow down, look at what our work looks like, and make sure we aren’t understaffing key functions.
I want to stabilize some core systems that aren’t as reliable as we need them to be. Our store area is one of the key areas where we’re focused right now.
And then (I want to) make sure we have the right infrastructure in place to support our strategies in omnichannel and some of the new advancements we want to drive within our stores.
