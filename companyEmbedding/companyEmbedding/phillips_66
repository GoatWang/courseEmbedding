    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The Phillips 66 Company (NYSE: PSX) is an American multinational energy company headquartered in Westchase, Houston, Texas. It debuted as an independent energy company when ConocoPhillips executed a spin-off of its downstream and midstream assets. Taking its name from the 1927 "Phillips 66" trademark of ConocoPhillips predecessor Phillips Petroleum Company, Phillips 66 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2012, under the ticker PSX. The company is engaged in producing natural gas liquids (NGL) and petrochemicals. The company has approximately 14,000 employees worldwide and is active in more than 65 countries.[2] Phillips 66 is ranked No. 30 on the Fortune 500 list and No. 74 on the Fortune Global 500 list as of 2016[update].[3][4]

History[edit]
Beginning[edit]
Founded by Lee Eldas "L.E." Phillips and Frank Phillips of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Phillips Petroleum Co. was incorporated on June 13, 1917. The new company had assets of $3 million, 27 employees and land throughout Oklahoma and Kansas. After discovery of Texas's huge Panhandle gas field in 1918 and the Hugoton Field to its north in Kansas, Phillips became increasingly involved in the rapidly developing natural gas industry. In particular, the company specialized in extracting liquids from natural gas and by 1925 was the nation's largest producer of natural gas liquids. In 1927, the company's gasoline was being tested on U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma, and when it turned out that the car was going 66 mph (106 km/h), which was fast at the time, the company decided to name the new fuel Phillips 66.[5]
The first Phillips 66 service station opened November 19, 1927 at 805 E. Central in Wichita, Kansas.[6] This station has been preserved by the local historical society.
Logo[edit]
The Phillips 66 shield logo, created for its link to the famous highway of the same number, was introduced in 1930 in a black and orange color scheme that would last nearly 30 years. In 1959, Phillips introduced a revised version of the shield in red, white and black, a color scheme still used by Phillips 66 Co. for the brand.

From the late 1930s until the 1960s, Phillips employed registered nurses as "highway hostesses," who made periodic and random visits to Phillips 66 stations within their regions. The women inspected station restroom facilities to ensure they were well cleaned and stocked. The highway hostesses also served as ambassadors for the company by directing motorists to suitable dining and lodging facilities. Union 76 employed similar hostesses, called the "Sparkle Corps."
Motor oil[edit]
Phillips was among the first oil companies to introduce a multi-grade motor oil, TropArtic, in 1954. Such motor oils were designed to be used year-round in automobile engines, as opposed to single grades for which different grades of motor oils were recommended to meet weather variances.
Gas stations[edit]
Phillips also had gasoline stations in Canada's western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan under the name Pacific 66 until the late 1970s. In 1932, the 76 brand, long familiar in the western U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal). In 1946, Phillips purchased the Utah-based Wasatch Oil Co., bringing the Phillips 66 brand to the northern Rocky Mountain states and the far eastern portions of Oregon and Washington. In 1966, Phillips entered the West Coast market by purchasing Tidewater Oil Co.'s refining and marketing properties in that region and rebranding all Flying A distributorships and service stations to Phillips 66.
In 1967, Phillips became the nation's second oil company, after Texaco, to sell and market gasoline in all 50 states, by opening a Phillips 66 station in Anchorage, Alaska. However, Phillips' experiment in 50-state marketing was short-lived. The company withdrew from gasoline marketing in the northeastern U.S. in 1972 (although it has been returning; for example, there is a Phillips 66 in Westport, Connecticut, Newington, Connecticut, Hadley, Massachusetts, and Exeter, New Hampshire, and the Phillips 66 owned 76 gas brand appearing in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), and sold the former Tidewater properties on the West Coast to The Oil & Shale Corporation (Tosco) in 1976. Today, Phillips 66 primarily operates in the Midwest and Southwest.
Mergers[edit]
Phillips 66 created a joint venture with Chevron Corporation's chemicals and plastics division in 2000, as well as, acquired ARCO Alaska Inc. from British Petroleum. It purchased Tosco, which included Circle K convenience stores and Union 76 gasoline, in 2001. The 76 brand, long familiar in the western and southern U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal) in 1932.
In 2002, Phillips 66 merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. The merged company continued marketing gasoline and other products under the Phillips 66, Conoco, and 76 brands. However, Phillips 66 Co. licenses the Phillips 66 brand to Suncor Energy for its Phillips 66 branded stations in Colorado.[7]
Marketing[edit]

The advertising slogan from circa 1973 until the ConocoPhillips merger was "The Performance Company," promoting not only the performance of Phillips 66 gasoline and other petroleum products, but also innovations with asphaltic materials, fertilizers and other non-automotive products. Other slogans through the years have included: "Go first-class... go Phillips 66", "The gasoline that won the West", "Good things for cars and the people who drive them", "Hard working gas", and "At Phillips 66, it's performance that counts". Their current slogan (July 2015) is "Proud To Be Here". The 2016 slogan will be "The Power of 2" after consolidation of the family of brands to just Phillips 66 and Kendall.
Phillips 66 also was a long-time supporter of PBS programming for most of the 1980s. It provided funding for shows such as A.M. Weather, The Search for Solutions, and Onstage with Judith Somogi.
Spin-off[edit]
In 2012, Phillips 66 was spun off from ConocoPhillips.
Berkshire Hathaway trade[edit]
On December 30, 2013, it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway would trade more than 19 million of its 27.2 million shares in Phillips 66 to acquire a business that makes additives that help crude oil flow through pipelines. The final number of shares will be determined when the deal actually closes.[8]
Spin-off of natural gas pipelines[edit]
On February 17, 2015, Phillips 66 sold two natural gas pipeline systems to its affiliate, Phillips 66 Partners for $1.01 billion in cash and stock.[9]
Operations[edit]
In the United States, the company operates Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations. In Europe, Phillips 66 operates Jet filling stations in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It sold its Jet stations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to its Russian affiliate, Lukoil. It uses the COOP identity in Switzerland. The company is the fourth largest finished lubricants supplier in the United States.
Phillips 66 owns 15 refineries with a net crude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day (350×10^3 m3/d), 10,000 branded marketing outlets, and 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of pipelines. It has 50 percent stake in DCP Midstream, LLC, a natural gas gatherers and processors with 7.2 billion cubic feet per day (200×10^6 m3/d) of processing capacity. It also owns 50 percent stake in Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
Phillips 66 also owns a one-quarter share in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[10]

Phillips 66's Los Angeles (CA), Lake Charles (LA), San Francisco (CA), and Sweeney (TX) refineries receive and process crude oil from the Amazon River Basin of South America. In 2015, the Los Angeles refinery was processing 21,512 barrels per day of Amazonian oil.
Corporate affairs[edit]
In 2012, after Phillips 66 split from ConocoPhillips, it moved its operations from the ConocoPhillips headquarters to the Pinnacle Westchase building,[14] a nine-story Class A office building located on 8.4 acres (3.4 ha) of land in Westchase, Houston.[15] This was a temporary headquarters location.[14]
In July 2016, Phillips 66 completed their move to a new permanent headquarters on a 14-acre (5.7 ha) plot of land in Westchase. The new headquarters is between Westheimer Road and Briar Forest, in close proximity to the Sam Houston Tollway. Phillips 66 purchased the land from a subsidiary of Thomas Properties Group. The architect of record is HOK.[16] The official groundbreaking was in November 2013, and the opening was completed on schedule. The 1.1 million square foot headquarters includes conference spaces, medical facilities, food service facilities, outdoor recreational space, a gymnasium with full-size basketball court, and training facilities. Irrigation of the outdoor landscaping is via a reclaimed water system. The new campus houses 2,200 workers who were spread among six different Houston locations, including the ConocoPhillips headquarters, where several hundred Phillips 66 workers had remained post spin-off.[14][17][18]
On 4 August 2015 it was announced that the company had formed a "long-term partnership" with English non-league association football club Leamington F.C.. The deal involved, amongst other things, the renaming of the club's ground from "The New Windmill Ground" to "The Phillips 66 Community Stadium."[19]

The Phillips 66 Company (NYSE: PSX) is an American multinational energy company headquartered in Westchase, Houston, Texas. It debuted as an independent energy company when ConocoPhillips executed a spin-off of its downstream and midstream assets. Taking its name from the 1927 "Phillips 66" trademark of ConocoPhillips predecessor Phillips Petroleum Company, Phillips 66 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2012, under the ticker PSX. The company is engaged in producing natural gas liquids (NGL) and petrochemicals. The company has approximately 14,000 employees worldwide and is active in more than 65 countries.[2] Phillips 66 is ranked No. 30 on the Fortune 500 list and No. 74 on the Fortune Global 500 list as of 2016[update].[3][4]

History[edit]
Beginning[edit]
Founded by Lee Eldas "L.E." Phillips and Frank Phillips of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Phillips Petroleum Co. was incorporated on June 13, 1917. The new company had assets of $3 million, 27 employees and land throughout Oklahoma and Kansas. After discovery of Texas's huge Panhandle gas field in 1918 and the Hugoton Field to its north in Kansas, Phillips became increasingly involved in the rapidly developing natural gas industry. In particular, the company specialized in extracting liquids from natural gas and by 1925 was the nation's largest producer of natural gas liquids. In 1927, the company's gasoline was being tested on U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma, and when it turned out that the car was going 66 mph (106 km/h), which was fast at the time, the company decided to name the new fuel Phillips 66.[5]
The first Phillips 66 service station opened November 19, 1927 at 805 E. Central in Wichita, Kansas.[6] This station has been preserved by the local historical society.
Logo[edit]
The Phillips 66 shield logo, created for its link to the famous highway of the same number, was introduced in 1930 in a black and orange color scheme that would last nearly 30 years. In 1959, Phillips introduced a revised version of the shield in red, white and black, a color scheme still used by Phillips 66 Co. for the brand.

From the late 1930s until the 1960s, Phillips employed registered nurses as "highway hostesses," who made periodic and random visits to Phillips 66 stations within their regions. The women inspected station restroom facilities to ensure they were well cleaned and stocked. The highway hostesses also served as ambassadors for the company by directing motorists to suitable dining and lodging facilities. Union 76 employed similar hostesses, called the "Sparkle Corps."
Motor oil[edit]
Phillips was among the first oil companies to introduce a multi-grade motor oil, TropArtic, in 1954. Such motor oils were designed to be used year-round in automobile engines, as opposed to single grades for which different grades of motor oils were recommended to meet weather variances.
Gas stations[edit]
Phillips also had gasoline stations in Canada's western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan under the name Pacific 66 until the late 1970s. In 1932, the 76 brand, long familiar in the western U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal). In 1946, Phillips purchased the Utah-based Wasatch Oil Co., bringing the Phillips 66 brand to the northern Rocky Mountain states and the far eastern portions of Oregon and Washington. In 1966, Phillips entered the West Coast market by purchasing Tidewater Oil Co.'s refining and marketing properties in that region and rebranding all Flying A distributorships and service stations to Phillips 66.
In 1967, Phillips became the nation's second oil company, after Texaco, to sell and market gasoline in all 50 states, by opening a Phillips 66 station in Anchorage, Alaska. However, Phillips' experiment in 50-state marketing was short-lived. The company withdrew from gasoline marketing in the northeastern U.S. in 1972 (although it has been returning; for example, there is a Phillips 66 in Westport, Connecticut, Newington, Connecticut, Hadley, Massachusetts, and Exeter, New Hampshire, and the Phillips 66 owned 76 gas brand appearing in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), and sold the former Tidewater properties on the West Coast to The Oil & Shale Corporation (Tosco) in 1976. Today, Phillips 66 primarily operates in the Midwest and Southwest.
Mergers[edit]
Phillips 66 created a joint venture with Chevron Corporation's chemicals and plastics division in 2000, as well as, acquired ARCO Alaska Inc. from British Petroleum. It purchased Tosco, which included Circle K convenience stores and Union 76 gasoline, in 2001. The 76 brand, long familiar in the western and southern U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal) in 1932.
In 2002, Phillips 66 merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. The merged company continued marketing gasoline and other products under the Phillips 66, Conoco, and 76 brands. However, Phillips 66 Co. licenses the Phillips 66 brand to Suncor Energy for its Phillips 66 branded stations in Colorado.[7]
Marketing[edit]

The advertising slogan from circa 1973 until the ConocoPhillips merger was "The Performance Company," promoting not only the performance of Phillips 66 gasoline and other petroleum products, but also innovations with asphaltic materials, fertilizers and other non-automotive products. Other slogans through the years have included: "Go first-class... go Phillips 66", "The gasoline that won the West", "Good things for cars and the people who drive them", "Hard working gas", and "At Phillips 66, it's performance that counts". Their current slogan (July 2015) is "Proud To Be Here". The 2016 slogan will be "The Power of 2" after consolidation of the family of brands to just Phillips 66 and Kendall.
Phillips 66 also was a long-time supporter of PBS programming for most of the 1980s. It provided funding for shows such as A.M. Weather, The Search for Solutions, and Onstage with Judith Somogi.
Spin-off[edit]
In 2012, Phillips 66 was spun off from ConocoPhillips.
Berkshire Hathaway trade[edit]
On December 30, 2013, it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway would trade more than 19 million of its 27.2 million shares in Phillips 66 to acquire a business that makes additives that help crude oil flow through pipelines. The final number of shares will be determined when the deal actually closes.[8]
Spin-off of natural gas pipelines[edit]
On February 17, 2015, Phillips 66 sold two natural gas pipeline systems to its affiliate, Phillips 66 Partners for $1.01 billion in cash and stock.[9]
Operations[edit]
In the United States, the company operates Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations. In Europe, Phillips 66 operates Jet filling stations in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It sold its Jet stations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to its Russian affiliate, Lukoil. It uses the COOP identity in Switzerland. The company is the fourth largest finished lubricants supplier in the United States.
Phillips 66 owns 15 refineries with a net crude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day (350×10^3 m3/d), 10,000 branded marketing outlets, and 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of pipelines. It has 50 percent stake in DCP Midstream, LLC, a natural gas gatherers and processors with 7.2 billion cubic feet per day (200×10^6 m3/d) of processing capacity. It also owns 50 percent stake in Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
Phillips 66 also owns a one-quarter share in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[10]

In 1932, the 76 brand, long familiar in the western U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal). In 1946, Phillips purchased the Utah-based Wasatch Oil Co., bringing the Phillips 66 brand to the northern Rocky Mountain states and the far eastern portions of Oregon and Washington. In 1966, Phillips entered the West Coast market by purchasing Tidewater Oil Co.'s refining and marketing properties in that region and rebranding all Flying A distributorships and service stations to Phillips 66.
In 1967, Phillips became the nation's second oil company, after Texaco, to sell and market gasoline in all 50 states, by opening a Phillips 66 station in Anchorage, Alaska. However, Phillips' experiment in 50-state marketing was short-lived. The company withdrew from gasoline marketing in the northeastern U.S. in 1972 (although it has been returning; for example, there is a Phillips 66 in Westport, Connecticut, Newington, Connecticut, Hadley, Massachusetts, and Exeter, New Hampshire, and the Phillips 66 owned 76 gas brand appearing in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), and sold the former Tidewater properties on the West Coast to The Oil & Shale Corporation (Tosco) in 1976. Today, Phillips 66 primarily operates in the Midwest and Southwest.
Mergers[edit]
Phillips 66 created a joint venture with Chevron Corporation's chemicals and plastics division in 2000, as well as, acquired ARCO Alaska Inc. from British Petroleum. It purchased Tosco, which included Circle K convenience stores and Union 76 gasoline, in 2001. The 76 brand, long familiar in the western and southern U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal) in 1932.
In 2002, Phillips 66 merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. The merged company continued marketing gasoline and other products under the Phillips 66, Conoco, and 76 brands. However, Phillips 66 Co. licenses the Phillips 66 brand to Suncor Energy for its Phillips 66 branded stations in Colorado.[7]
Marketing[edit]

The advertising slogan from circa 1973 until the ConocoPhillips merger was "The Performance Company," promoting not only the performance of Phillips 66 gasoline and other petroleum products, but also innovations with asphaltic materials, fertilizers and other non-automotive products. Other slogans through the years have included: "Go first-class... go Phillips 66", "The gasoline that won the West", "Good things for cars and the people who drive them", "Hard working gas", and "At Phillips 66, it's performance that counts". Their current slogan (July 2015) is "Proud To Be Here". The 2016 slogan will be "The Power of 2" after consolidation of the family of brands to just Phillips 66 and Kendall.
Phillips 66 also was a long-time supporter of PBS programming for most of the 1980s. It provided funding for shows such as A.M. Weather, The Search for Solutions, and Onstage with Judith Somogi.
Spin-off[edit]
In 2012, Phillips 66 was spun off from ConocoPhillips.
Berkshire Hathaway trade[edit]
On December 30, 2013, it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway would trade more than 19 million of its 27.2 million shares in Phillips 66 to acquire a business that makes additives that help crude oil flow through pipelines. The final number of shares will be determined when the deal actually closes.[8]
Spin-off of natural gas pipelines[edit]
On February 17, 2015, Phillips 66 sold two natural gas pipeline systems to its affiliate, Phillips 66 Partners for $1.01 billion in cash and stock.[9]
Operations[edit]
In the United States, the company operates Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations. In Europe, Phillips 66 operates Jet filling stations in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It sold its Jet stations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to its Russian affiliate, Lukoil. It uses the COOP identity in Switzerland. The company is the fourth largest finished lubricants supplier in the United States.
Phillips 66 owns 15 refineries with a net crude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day (350×10^3 m3/d), 10,000 branded marketing outlets, and 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of pipelines. It has 50 percent stake in DCP Midstream, LLC, a natural gas gatherers and processors with 7.2 billion cubic feet per day (200×10^6 m3/d) of processing capacity. It also owns 50 percent stake in Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
Phillips 66 also owns a one-quarter share in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[10]

Phillips 66's Los Angeles (CA), Lake Charles (LA), San Francisco (CA), and Sweeney (TX) refineries receive and process crude oil from the Amazon River Basin of South America. In 2015, the Los Angeles refinery was processing 21,512 barrels per day of Amazonian oil.
Corporate affairs[edit]
In 2012, after Phillips 66 split from ConocoPhillips, it moved its operations from the ConocoPhillips headquarters to the Pinnacle Westchase building,[14] a nine-story Class A office building located on 8.4 acres (3.4 ha) of land in Westchase, Houston.[15] This was a temporary headquarters location.[14]
In July 2016, Phillips 66 completed their move to a new permanent headquarters on a 14-acre (5.7 ha) plot of land in Westchase. The new headquarters is between Westheimer Road and Briar Forest, in close proximity to the Sam Houston Tollway. Phillips 66 purchased the land from a subsidiary of Thomas Properties Group. The architect of record is HOK.[16] The official groundbreaking was in November 2013, and the opening was completed on schedule. The 1.1 million square foot headquarters includes conference spaces, medical facilities, food service facilities, outdoor recreational space, a gymnasium with full-size basketball court, and training facilities. Irrigation of the outdoor landscaping is via a reclaimed water system. The new campus houses 2,200 workers who were spread among six different Houston locations, including the ConocoPhillips headquarters, where several hundred Phillips 66 workers had remained post spin-off.[14][17][18]
On 4 August 2015 it was announced that the company had formed a "long-term partnership" with English non-league association football club Leamington F.C.. The deal involved, amongst other things, the renaming of the club's ground from "The New Windmill Ground" to "The Phillips 66 Community Stadium."[19]

Phillips 66 is among the largest refiners in the United States and a major supplier of jet fuels and avgas to general, commercial and military aviation. Our extensive network of refineries, pipelines and supply terminals are strategically located to provide reliable and cost-effective supply across the country. For you, this translates into secure supply now and in the future.
Pilots and FBOs have been relying on Phillips 66 Aviation for more than 85 years as their source for the highest quality jet and aviation gasoline fuels. Our stature in aviation stretches back to WWII, when we developed 100-octane fuel. Later, we developed anti-icing additives for jet fuel and made technology improvements such as the controllable-pitch propeller, the first refueling truck, and the drag chute. At Phillips 66 Aviation, our dedication to innovation continues today. We remain an industry leader, providing forward-thinking programs and quality fuel for both the flying community and our vast network of high-quality FBOs.This site contains information about Phillips 66 Aviation, its programs and its lubricants, as well as links to additional aviation resources.

Page Content



























 Phillips 66 produces asphalt at its Wood River refinery in Roxana, Illinois. Consistent production of high quality asphalt is essential to the operation of the refinery and great care is taken to ensure that the optimum blend of crude feed for quality asphalt production is obtained. Finished products are distributed throughout the Midwest by barge, truck and rail. Product is available directly from the refinery or through the company’s network of asphalt terminals. This site offers a list of the company’s asphalt products, as well as locations and contact information, and links for additional research.

Phillips 66 Type M Aviation Oil 20w-50 


HomeAviation Lubricants By ApplicationAviation Piston Engine OilsMulti-Viscosity Mineral Oil for Engine Break-inPhillips 66 Type M Aviation Oil 20w-50 



Phillips 66 Type M Aviation Oil 20W-50 is an ashless, nondispersant, multigrade engine oil recommended for use in aircraft piston engines where the operator prefers a mineral oil-based engine oil that does not contain dispersant additives. It provides easier starting and quicker oil circulation at low temperatures compared with single-grade mineral oils, while maintaining high film strength at high temperatures and under high loads for protection against wear and piston scuffing.
Phillips 66 Type M Aviation Oil 20W-50 typically is used as break-in oil for newly overhauled engines where all-mineral type oils are recommended. The multigrade formulation helps reduce cylinder glazing tendency during break-in. Break-in normally is accomplished in less than 25 hours of engine operation.
Phillips 66 Type M Aviation Oil 20W-50 Benefits

Easier starting and quicker oil circulation at low temperatures compared with single-grade oils
High film strength for protection against wear and piston scuffing, even under high-load conditions, such as takeoff, and at elevated operating temperatures
Reduces cylinder glazing tendency during break-in, compared with single-grade oils

Phillips 66 Type M Aviation Oil 20W-50 Application

Aircraft piston engines where the operator prefers a nondispersant engine oil
Break-in oil for newly overhauled aircraft engines
