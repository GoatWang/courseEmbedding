Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

A New Model for Investing in Energy Innovation

			
        By Bill Gates 


			
         |
            December 12, 2016
    
		











By the middle of this century, the world will use twice as much energy as we use today.
There’s good news in this: more energy means better lives and stronger economies.
But it also means the world needs a new energy supply—one that doesn’t contribute to climate change. Climate change is a serious threat, especially in the poorest parts of the world.  
We need affordable and reliable energy that doesn’t emit greenhouse gas to power the future—and to get it, we need a different model for investing in good ideas and moving them from the lab to the market.
That is why today, I, along with an incredible group of people who care a lot about energy innovation, am announcing the launch of Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), a fund that will invest more than $1 billion in scientific breakthroughs that have the potential to deliver cheap and reliable clean energy to the world.
It’s the next step in an effort that began last December, when we brought together private investors from around the globe who were passionate about solving this problem. We formed the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a group of entrepreneurs, business leaders, and institutional investors committed to help bring promising new zero-emissions energy technologies to market.
The Coalition partnered with Mission Innovation, an initiative of more than 20 countries and the European Union to double their investment in clean energy research and development in the next five years.  
 
As I’ve argued before, an investment in a true energy transformation requires governments, research institutions, businesses, and private investors to work together. And it’s hard to overstate how important this public commitment is. Government funding gives scientists the freedom to come up with bold new ideas and try to prove they will work. But government research is not enough. The world needs the skills and resources of investors with experience driving innovation from a lab to the marketplace. The private sector knows how to take great research, turn it into a great product, and ultimately create a great company to bring a transformative technology to market.
It’s this type of public-private collaboration that’s given rise to advances in defense, space, medicine, and information technology. In fact, it’s what brought these words to your screen right now. During the Cold War, the Department of Defense developed a network of computers that could survive a nuclear attack, and private companies saw an opportunity to expand this technology to the public. Together, they created the Internet.
When it comes to energy, though, this transition—from idea to product to company—is often complicated by the challenges of the market. Unlike a software start up, getting a new energy technology from a lab to market takes a lot of infrastructure, a lot of upfront capital, and a lot of time.
The Breakthrough Energy Coalition created BEV to address some of those challenges in the energy market. We are willing to wait a longer time for returns than other funds. We have a higher tolerance for technical risk, because we know it’s tough to determine which technologies will succeed in a complicated energy market. We are led by our investors, who are a unique group of global business leaders, entrepreneurs, energy experts, and company builders who can help new companies navigate the challenges of building a business while developing partnerships with the companies and institutional investors who will help bring those products to scale. 
The fund is also driven by science. Because of the technical nature of succeeding in an energy market, we will build a team that knows as much about the science behind energy breakthroughs as the investment strategies necessary to build those businesses.
Finally, the fund is committed to discovering breakthroughs, wherever they are. The world has made remarkable progress in wind and solar over the past decade, and these technologies will continue to play an important role in our zero-carbon energy mix. I have argued before that innovative industries deploy the technology they have while developing the technology they need. But because the scale of the challenge of providing reliable and affordable power without contributing to climate change is so vast, and the future energy needs are so great, we need to explore as many viable solutions as possible. As I’ve learned through my work in business and philanthropy: to be successful, you have to get the most out of the technology you already have while developing the technology you still need.
After talking with some of the world’s greatest scientists, energy experts, and energy investors, the Coalition has developed a list of scientific priorities that will set us on the path toward the energy future we need. We see this list as a “landscape of innovation”—essentially, a roadmap that Breakthrough Energy Ventures and others can use to focus their attention and guide their investment decisions over the next two decades.
In this landscape, we’ve outlined five grand challenges, corresponding to the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions around the world:

Electricity: How can we deliver reliable, affordable zero-carbon electricity to the world?
Buildings: How can we eliminate emissions from our homes, offices, hospitals, and schools?
Manufacturing: How can we make everything we use without emitting greenhouse gases?
Transportation: How can we get around our communities and the world without emitting carbon?
Food: How can we feed the planet without contributing to climate change?

Of course, no investor can answer these questions alone. That’s why, in addition to funding new ventures, Breakthrough Energy investors will help build a broader clean energy ecosystem. We’ll explore new partnerships with governments, businesses, and institutional investors who want to be part of the global energy transition. Through these partnerships, we will not only help organize more investments, but we will also help research new solutions. One of the Coalition’s partners is the University of California, which has an amazing capacity to innovate through their labs and universities. In the coming years, we’ll work with them to expand our research partnerships and identify the best ways to pull great inventions out of the lab and turn them into companies. 
Even though $1 billion is a significant step, it is just one of many steps on the path to a sustainable energy future.
With patience, flexibility, collaboration, and a clear vision backed by meaningful investment, we, the fund’s investors, are confident the world can meet its energy needs in a way that is fair, safe, and sustainable. And we’re excited about the role that Breakthrough Energy Ventures will play in that effort.

PRESS RELEASE
SEATTLE, Dec. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Today, members of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition (BEC) have committed to invest more than $1 billion in Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), an investor-led fund that will finance emerging energy breakthroughs to deliver affordable and reliable energy with the goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to near-zero.
“It is extremely exciting for us to launch this fund as the next step in the commitment made by the Breakthrough Energy Coalition last year,” said BEV Chairman Bill Gates. “I am honored to work along with these investors to build on the powerful foundation of public investment in basic research. Our goal is to build companies that will help deliver the next generation of reliable, affordable, and emissions-free energy to the world.”
About Breakthrough Energy Ventures
The world is demanding more energy and goods than ever before, bringing about new opportunities for economic growth, but also increasing pressure on our climate. Successfully navigating this dynamic requires a combination of new tools and solutions to help scale the most promising technologies we have today.
Breakthrough Energy Ventures will collaborate with other investors, governments, research institutions and corporate partners, bringing to the table an investor-led fund with internal scientific expertise, a long-term horizon, and a tolerance and understanding of the investment risks required to transform energy markets.
The mission, experience and global networks of BEV investors will allow it to attract the best scientists, entrepreneurs, and private sector experts to guide the fund’s trajectory. BEV is not confined to any segment of the investment pipeline—it will build companies, engage in traditional venture investment, and have the ability to invest for growth as innovations mature. 





Today’s announcement continues the commitments made by these investors when the BEC was launched last year alongside Mission Innovation, an international collaboration to accelerate the pace of clean energy innovations through smart government investment. BEV will help build companies based on the promising technologies that come out of these countries’ scaled-up public research pipelines.
In addition to the formation of the BEV, the BEC today shared its “Landscape of Innovation,” which illustrates the universe of technologies that public and private investors might support in order to lead us to a world of zero carbon emissions. The Landscape will serve not only as a tool for the BEV to guide investment focus, but also as a guide for other public and private investors committed to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The scale of the challenge and the size of the opportunity presented by the global energy market will require investments far beyond the resources of the BEV. It will take the efforts of governments and investors from around the world.
Because of the size of the challenges and opportunities, the launch of the BEV and sharing of the landscape is just the initial step for Breakthrough Energy. In the future it will explore how the coalition can help organize an ecosystem of investment by engaging strategic corporate partners to coordinate expertise and capital to move these technologies forward. Led by our partners at the University of California, we will engage a similar network of international research institutions to develop an investment pipeline of projects as well as identify other investment partnership opportunities. 





Board Of Directors Statements
“Too often we let what we think we know limit what is possible. When it comes to energy, people say you cannot make money, meet demand, and also benefit the environment. But we can, and we will. This effort will combine technological innovation and scientific knowledge with the investment expertise needed to transform energy markets. Together, we’ll remind the world that visionary ideas make wonderful realities.” – Jack Ma, Executive Chairman, Alibaba Group
“BEV is a fresh, bold initiative to invest in energy breakthroughs. It is building a global network of the best scientists, innovators, investors, and business leaders. BEV’s mission is to find, fund, and accelerate the success of technologies and entrepreneurs who will create our zero carbon future.” – John Doerr, Chairman, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers
“BEV is taking the bold step to support companies in a complicated market with tremendous promise for changing the world while being a strong investment. Successful investing in any market requires patience for failure and identifying the best tools for addressing the idiosyncrasies of that market. The investors leading BEV will back some of the most innovative companies.” – Vinod Khosla, Founder, Khosla Ventures
“The dearth of venture funding for clean energy technologies threatens to create a valley of death for the industry, with emerging ideas unable to find the necessary capital to reach commercialization. As an investor led effort, Breakthrough Energy Ventures is designed as a source of patient capital to spur innovation to meet the growing demand for low-cost, clean energy solutions.” – John Arnold, Co-Chair, Laura and John Arnold Foundation 





“Energy is one of the critical drivers for economic growth. Several parts of the developing economies still do not have access to affordable and reliable energy. It is an immediate need to find and provide new energy sources that are affordable, clean and reliable for every person on our planet. Breakthrough Energy Ventures will help build the companies that can solve and deploy new energy solutions everywhere.” – Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited
“We need to create new companies to push the boundaries of innovation. The businesses that Breakthrough Energy Ventures will fund and grow are going to develop the disruptive technology to help satisfy the world’s energy needs while also limiting the impact on our environment.” – Hasso Plattner, Co-Founder, SAP SE
About The Breakthrough Energy Coalition
The Breakthrough Energy Coalition (BEC) is an influential group of investors and institutions that is committed to investing in technology that can help solve the urgent energy and climate challenges facing the planet. The BEC was launched alongside Mission Innovation, a global initiative of 22 countries and the European Union to accelerate the pace of clean energy innovations through smart government spending that increases the rate of innovation in their domestic sectors.

PRESS RELEASE
SEATTLE, Feb. 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV) today announced Eric Toone as executive managing director and science lead and David Danielson as managing director for science. The two are the first employees hired on the BEV science team since the $1 billion fund launched in December to finance emerging technology with the potential to deliver affordable, reliable, zero-carbon energy.
“BEV’s vision to transform the energy market requires the deep in-house scientific expertise that Eric and David provide,” said John Arnold, BEV board member, founder of Centaurus Advisors and co-chair of the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. “They understand the unique complexities of the energy technology landscape and what it will take to build the breakthroughs that will power the world in the future.”
As the core of the scientific team, Toone and Danielson will work with investors, entrepreneurs, and managers as part of the BEV leadership group, which is currently being hired. Together, the BEV team will make investments that align to the leadership and strategic direction established by the fund’s board. 





Toone was most recently the leader of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative at Duke University. In 2009, he was a founding member of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E) where he created and led the agency’s electrofuels program. Toone, who holds a PhD in organic chemistry from the University of Toronto, has also founded three pharmaceutical companies—Vindica Pharmaceuticals, Valanbio Therapeutics and Aerie Pharmaceuticals—that scaled novel research into commercially-viable products.
Danielson joins BEV from Stanford University, where he is a Precourt Energy Scholar. Prior to Stanford, Danielson spent seven years at the U.S. Department of Energy, including four years as assistant secretary of energy heading the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy—the world’s largest government funding agency devoted exclusively to energy innovation. In 2009, Danielson joined ARPA-E as its first employee and worked closely with Toone to build the organization. Danielson holds a PhD in materials science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In December 2016, members of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition formed Breakthrough Energy Ventures as a vehicle to help satisfy the world’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, zero-carbon energy. The investor-led fund is currently focused on building its management team, which is being recruited from a global talent pool of entrepreneurs, scientists and investment experts. As a for-profit, private-sector effort, BEV builds on the foundation of research laid by efforts such as Mission Innovation—a commitment by 22 nations and the European Union to double their investment in clean energy R&D. 





About Breakthrough Energy Ventures
Founded by members of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV) invests in next generation technologies to provide reliable, affordable, zero-carbon energy, food, and products to the world. BEV is led by investors, guided by science, and equipped with patient and flexible capital needed to transform the energy market.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
