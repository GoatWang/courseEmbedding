You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Impact Genetics Inc. > About Us > Our Company
Dr. Brenda Gallie, an internationally recognized leader in retinoblastoma genetics, biology and clinical care founded Impact Genetics’ team in 1999. Over the next decade, our clinical tests for retinoblastoma and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia gained the trust of medical specialists around the world because of the quality of our lab work, focused expertise in those diseases and excellent service.
In 2012, Impact Genetics Inc. combined the expertise of Retinoblastoma Solutions, HHT Solutions and Solutions by Sequence into one company. In 2013, Dynacare Medical Laboratories acquired Impact Genetics, helping us to support our expanding mission of providing cost-effective, high quality genetic testing for rare diseases. Dynacare, owned by LabCorp, is one of Canada’s largest and most respected providers of laboratory services. In 2016, Impact Genetics’ tests were listed on the LabCorp test menu, improving US customer access to Impact Genetics tests.
Dr. Gallie’s original team continues with Impact and together with our new partners, we will build Impact’s expanding services with the same care, attention to detail and expertise we are renowned for. Our growing team is committed to providing high quality genetic diagnostics for rare diseases, to as many people as possible.

Impact Genetics Inc. > Testing Services > Retinoblastoma (RB)
Retinoblastoma (RB): Test Description
Genes tested:


RB1
MYCN


Copy number changes
Our lab uses MLPA multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification to look for whole-exon and multi-exon deletions and duplications in the RB1 gene; this method simultaneously screens for small intra-exon insertions and deletions in RB1. Our lab also performs a QM-PCR test to measure MYCN copy number in any tumor sample that does not have an RB1 mutation. This test detects a new sub-set of retinoblastoma with early age at diagnosis, distinct histology, no RB1 mutations, and huge amplification of the MYCN oncogene. [Rushlow, D. et al. 2013. Lancet Oncology.]
Sequence analysis
Our lab sequences the RB1 gene core promoter and exons 1 through 25, as well as nearby flanking intronic regions. Our sequence analysis is able to detect mosaic mutations at a level of 15% or greater. We consider reported polymorphisms when designing our sequencing assays to ensure the accuracy of our sequence results.
Splice site analysis
We sequence a minimum of 25 nucleotides flanking each exon of RB1 to detect changes in splice sites. We use in silico analysis and scoring to determine whether a particular change is likely to cause missplicing. In the case of an intronic variant of uncertain significance we perform RNA transcript analysis on a fresh blood sample at no added charge.
Allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) for eleven recurrent RB1 mutations
Our lab uses multiplex AS-PCR screens for rapid detection of eleven recurrent RB1 mutations, which are then confirmed by sequence analysis. The highly sensitive AS-PCR can detect the eleven mutations at mosaic levels as low as 1% mutant DNA.
Testing for methylation of the RB1 Promoter
Aberrant methylation of the RB1 promoter leads to reduced transcription of RB1, and can initiate unilateral sporadic retinoblastoma in the absence of an RB1 mutation. Our lab identifies RB1 promoter methylation leading to retinoblastoma in approximately 12% of unilateral sporadic tumors.
Amino acid conservation analysis
For missense amino acid changes of uncertain significance we employ several in silico conservation analysis programs to predict whether a particular missense change is likely to be pathogenic. In addition, when appropriate we will test known affected and unaffected relatives at no charge to clarify variant classification.

Literature Review of articles in Molecular Biology Genetics Bioinformatics The Impact of Bacterial Genomics on Natural Product ResearchArticle · Literature Review · January 2006 with 33 ReadsDOI: 10.1002/anie.200501080 · Source: PubMed1st Helge B Bode42.76 · Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main2nd Rolf Müller49.21 · Universität des SaarlandesAbstract"There's life in the old dog yet!" This adage also holds true for natural product research. After the era of natural products was declared to be over, because of the introduction of combinatorial synthesis techniques, natural product research has taken a surprising turn back towards a major field of pharmaceutical research. Current challenges, such as emerging multidrug-resistant bacteria, might be overcome by developments which combine genomic knowledge with applied biology and chemistry to identify, produce, and alter the structure of new lead compounds. Significant biological activity is reported much less frequently for synthetic compounds, a fact reflected in the large proportion of natural products and their derivatives in clinical use. This Review describes the impact of microbial genomics on natural products research, in particularly the search for new lead structures and their optimization. The limitations of this research are also discussed, thus allowing a look into future developments.Do you want to read the rest of this article?Request full-text12 Figures

The identified gene clusters were mostly linked to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and NRPS-polyketide synthases (PKS) hybrid clusters (Medema et al., 2011). Molecular Keys to the Janthinobacterium and Duganella spp. Interaction with the Plant Pathogen Fusarium graminearum[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Janthinobacterium and Duganella are well-known for their antifungal effects. Surprisingly, almost nothing is known on molecular aspects involved in the close bacterium-fungus interaction. To better understand this interaction, we established the genomes of 11 Janthinobacterium and Duganella isolates in combination with phylogenetic and functional analyses of all publicly available genomes. Thereby, we identified a core and pan genome of 1058 and 23,628 genes. All strains encoded secondary metabolite gene clusters and chitinases, both possibly involved in fungal growth suppression. All but one strain carried a single gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of alpha-hydroxyketone-like autoinducer molecules, designated JAI-1. Genome-wide RNA-seq studies employing the background of two isolates and the corresponding JAI-1 deficient strains identified a set of 45 QS-regulated genes in both isolates. Most regulated genes are characterized by a conserved sequence motif within the promoter region. Among the most strongly regulated genes were secondary metabolite and type VI secretion system gene clusters. Most intriguing, co-incubation studies of J. sp. HH102 or its corresponding JAI-1 synthase deletion mutant with the plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum provided first evidence of a QS-dependent interaction with this pathogen.

Genome sequencing played a key role in the revitalization of natural products research[24], which was largely abandoned by the pharmaceutical industry, and created a rush to incorporate 'omic' sciences into discovery pipelines[25,26]. With increasing access to genome sequence data have come opportunities to ask broader questions about secondary metabolism, such as a recent global analysis of 1154 diverse bacterial genomes[27]. Natural Products and the Gene Cluster Revolution[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Genome sequencing has created unprecedented opportunities for natural-product discovery and new insight into the diversity and distributions of natural-product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). These gene collectives are highly evolved for horizontal exchange, thus providing immediate opportunities to test the effects of small molecules on fitness. The marine actinomycete genus Salinispora maintains extraordinary levels of BGC diversity and has become a useful model for studies of secondary metabolism. Most Salinispora BGCs are observed infrequently, resulting in high population-level diversity while conforming to constraints associated with maximum genome size. Comparative genomics is providing a mechanism to assess secondary metabolism in the context of evolution and evidence that some products represent ecotype-defining traits while others appear selectively neutral. Full-text · Article · Aug 2016 Paul R JensenRead full-textNatural products from lichens have gained immense interest due to their broad range of biological activity [7,8]. From in silico analyses of the lichen genomes [12,51525354 it is obvious that lichens harbor a yet underestimated number of PKS and NRPS encoding genes as it is also the case for fungal and bacterial natural product producers [55]. As all NRPS and type I PKS known up to date require a PPTase for activity, we initially focused on the identification of a PPTase from the lichen E. prunastri as model system that is also known as oakmoss. Identification of the Sfp-Type PPTase EppA from the Lichenized Fungus Evernia prunastri[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: In the last decades, natural products from lichens have gained more interest for pharmaceutical application due to the broad range of their biological activity. However, isolation of the compounds of interest directly from the lichen is neither feasible nor sustainable due to slow growth of many lichens. In order to develop a pipeline for heterologous expression of lichen biosynthesis gene clusters and thus the sustainable production of their bioactive compounds we have identified and characterized the phosphopantheteinyl transferase (PPTase) EppA from the lichen Evernia prunastri. The Sfp-type PPTase EppA was functionally characterized through heterologous expression in E. coli using the production of the blue pigment indigoidine as readout and by complementation of a lys5 deletion in S. cerevisiae. Full-text · Article · Jan 2016 Olivia SchimmingImke SchmittHelge B BodeRead full-textStreptomyces bacteria have evolved to produce a vast array of important bioactive secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics, antitumor agents and insecticides (Berdy, 2005; Bode and Müller, 2005 ). Pristinamycin, which is produced by Streptomyces pristinaespiralis , is a streptogramin antibiotic that contains two chemically unrelated molecules, pristinamycin I (PI) and pristinamycin II (PII). A stepwise increase in pristinamycin II biosynthesis by Streptomyces pristinaespiralis through combinatorial metabolic engineering[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Pristinamycin, which is a streptogramin antibiotic produced by Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, contains two chemically unrelated compounds, pristinamycin I (PI) and pristinamycin II (PII). Semi-synthetic derivatives of PI and PII have been approved for use in human medicine to treat a broad range of drug-resistant pathogens. In this study, we design and implement a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy for improving PII production. First, an extra copy of the PII biosynthetic gene cluster, which was assembled using a modified Gibson assembly method for cloning large DNA fragments with high GC contents, was introduced into a high-producing strain S. pristinaespiralis HCCB10218. This duplication of the PII biosynthetic gene cluster resulted in a maximum increase in PII titer by 45%. Second, all seven cluster-situated regulatory genes (from papR1 to papR6 and spbR) were systematically manipulated. Higher PII titers were achieved by deleting either one of the two repressor genes papR3 or papR5 in combination with overexpression of both activator genes papR4 and papR6, and the resulting strains ∆papR3+R4R6 and ∆papR5+R4R6 showed maximum increases in PII production by 99% and 75%, respectively. A combination of the above two different approaches was employed. Integration of the assembled PII gene cluster (BAC-F1F15) into ∆papR5+R4R6 led to the highest PII titer improvement, which was approximately 1.5-fold higher than the parental strain. By adding the macroreticular resin, which can separate pristinamycin in situ and thereby lessen end-product feedback inhibition and toxic effects, PII titers of the final engineered strain ∆papR5+R4R6/BAC-F1F15 reached 1.13 and 1.16g/L in the Erlenmeyer flask and 5-L bioreactor, respectively, with 5.13- and 5.26-fold improvements over the parental strain. Taken together, this combinatorial strategy is an efficient method to optimize PII biosynthesis of S. pristinaespiralis and may be extended to other industrially used streptomycetes for strain improvement.

The genomic revolution of the last decade has had a tremendous impact in the field due to the revelation of the hidden potential these organisms have for production of natural products (Baltz, 2008; Bode and Muller, 2005; Corre and Challis, 2009; Nett et al., 2009; Scherlach and Hertweck, 2009; Zerikly and Challis, 2009). In turn, this has generated a wide interest in the development of methodologies that could be used for exploitation of this untapped reservoir of metabolites, and several different methods ranging from heterologous expression (Escribano and Bibb, 2014; Ongley et al., 2013) to modification of regulatory networks (Scherlach and Hertweck, 2009) have been established, with each having their own limitations (Craney et al., 2013). Targeted activation of silent natural product biosynthesis pathways by reporter-guided mutant selection[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The continuously increasing genome sequencing data has revealed numerous cryptic pathways, which might encode novel secondary metabolites with interesting biological activities. However, utilization of this hidden potential has been hindered by the observation that many of these gene clusters remain silent (or poorly expressed) under laboratory conditions. Here we present reporter-guided mutant selection (RGMS) as an effective and widely applicable method for targeted activation of silent gene clusters in the native producers. The strategy takes advantage of genome-scale random mutagenesis for generation of genetic diversity and a reporter-guided selection system for the identification of the desired target-activated mutants. It was first validated in the re-activation of jadomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230, where high efficiency of activation was achieved. The same strategy was then applied to a hitherto unactivable pga gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. PGA64 leading to the identification of two new anthraquinone aminoglycosides, gaudimycin D and E.

Type III PKSs, however, are homodimeric enzymes with interactively-acting domains (Bode and Müller, 2005). While type I PKS genes are common among cyanobacteria, type II and III PKS genes have been rarely identified. Exploring cyanobacterial genomes for natural product biosynthesis pathways[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Cyanobacteria produce a vast array of natural products, some of which are toxic to human health, while others possess potential pharmaceutical activities. Genome mining enables the identification and characterisation of natural product gene clusters; however, currently the number of cyanobacterial genomes remains low compared to other phyla. There has been a recent effort to rectify this issue by increasing the number of sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. This has enabled the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters for structurally diverse metabolites, including non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, ribosomal peptides, UV-absorbing compounds, alkaloids, terpenes and fatty acids. While some of the identified biosynthetic gene clusters correlate with known metabolites, genome mining also highlights the number and diversity of clusters for which the product is unknown (referred to as orphan gene clusters). A number of bioinformatics tools have recently been developed in order to predict the products of orphan gene clusters; however, in some cases the complexity of the cyanobacterial pathways makes the prediction problematic. This can be overcome by the use of mass spectrometry-guided natural product genome mining, or heterologous expression. Application of these techniques to cyanobacterial natural product gene clusters will be explored.
