To maximize the value of CRH, Mr. Wright leveraged our relationships with the GI community leading to the launch of CRH Anesthesia Management, a business focused on providing GI anesthesia services to Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”) across the US. CRH Anesthesia is now the primary driver of the company’s revenue and is positioned as one of the leading GI anesthesia brands in the US with outstanding growth potential. 

Under Mr. Wright’s management CRH has become a profitable company with strong cash flow generation and access to North American capital markets to fund the company’s long-term growth strategy. 

Mr. Wright is a member of the Young Presidents’ Organization and Chair of Vancouver College’s Board of Directors.

												Edward Wright												 - Chief Executive Officer, Director											
											Mr. Wright became CEO and director of the company in September of 2006. Prior to joining CRH he gained extensive management experience in global luxury brands at Richemont, the holding company for some of the world’s leading luxury goods. As President of Baume & Mercier first, and then as Executive Vice-President of North America Retail for Cartier, Mr. Wright developed an ability for building solid relationships with customers and business partners alike.

Upon arriving at CRH, Mr. Wright was tasked with maximizing the value of CRH’s O’Regan System. He quickly determined that CRH needed to transition from a retail model to a wholesale model and by introducing it to the gastrointestinal (“GI”) community in the US, he created a paradigm shift for gastrointestinal doctors (“GIs”) by extending their continuum of care for patients. 

To maximize the value of CRH, Mr. Wright leveraged our relationships with the GI community leading to the launch of CRH Anesthesia Management, a business focused on providing GI anesthesia services to Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”) across the US. CRH Anesthesia is now the primary driver of the company’s revenue and is positioned as one of the leading GI anesthesia brands in the US with outstanding growth potential. 

Under Mr. Wright’s management CRH has become a profitable company with strong cash flow generation and access to North American capital markets to fund the company’s long-term growth strategy. 

Mr. Wright is a member of the Young Presidents’ Organization and Chair of Vancouver College’s Board of Directors.
