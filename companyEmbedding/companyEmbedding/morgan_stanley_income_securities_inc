Investment Approach

We seek a high level of current income and as a secondary objective, capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of debt issued by corporations and other non-government issuers over the long term. To help achieve this objective, the fund combines a top-down macroeconomic assessment, to identify the most attractively priced securities based on our proprietary valuation methodology and to construct portfolios that represent the best values available in the market, with rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis. We focus on high and medium quality sectors of the credit market, while our investment process leads to an emphasis on larger capitalization issuers.

Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors /Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the fund's current annual report.
Growth of Investment illustration is based on an initial investment of $10,000 made since fund inception, assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not include sales charges and fees. Performance would have been lower if sales charges and fees had been included. Results are hypothetical.
Please keep in mind that high double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions. 
The Net Asset Value (NAV) per share is determined by dividing the value of the fund's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the fund at a given time. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the fund's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the period. SEC yield is a measure of the income generated by the portfolio's underlying asset over the trailing 30 days, relative to the asset base of the portfolio itself. The SEC 30-Day yield - Subsidized (Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The SEC 30-Day yield- Unsubsidized (Unsub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect.
Subject to change daily. Fund information and Portfolio Composition are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the sectors and countries presented. Monthly Holdings are updated 15 calendar days after month-end.
The repurchase information only represents shares repurchased as part of a share repurchase program and does not account for any shares repurchased through a tender offer.
RISK CONSIDERATIONS
There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is significant possibility of loss. Concentration in a single region may make the portfolio more volatile than one that invests globally. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In the current rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Investments in securities rated below investment grade (commonly known as "junk bonds") present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk).  

The Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate Bond Index - measures the investment grade, fixed-rate, taxable corporate bond market. It includes USD denominated securities publicly issued by US and non-US industrial, utility and financial issuers. The indices do not include any expenses, fees or sales charges, which would have lower performance. The indices are unmanaged and should not be considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

1 Source: Barron's “Top 100 Financial Advisors,” April 17, 2017. Barron's “Top 100 Financial Advisors” bases its ratings on qualitative criteria: professionals with a minimum of seven years of financial services experience, acceptable compliance records, client retention reports, customer satisfaction, and more. Financial Advisors are quantitatively rated based on varying types of revenues and assets advised by the financial professional, with weightings associated for each. Because individual client portfolio performance varies and is typically unaudited, this rating focuses on customer satisfaction and quality of advice. The rating may not be representative of any one client’s experience because it reflects a sample of all of the experiences of the Financial Advisor’s clients. The rating is not indicative of the Financial Advisor’s future performance.

Morgan Stanley in 2009 was worth $50 billion less than its longtime rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. After reporting strong earnings on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley has nearly closed that gap.

The surprising turnabout between the two rivals shows just how much has changed on Wall Street since the financial crisis: Boring is beating swashbuckling. 
Goldman's strengths -- making market bets and serving hedge funds -- have been zapped by new regulations and investors' aversion to risk. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has cut traders and trained those who remain to take fewer risks, while adding to businesses that make money reliably and aren't penalized by capital rules. 
The quarter was challenging for the industry as trading sputtered and loan growth stalled in spots. All six of the big banks beat analysts' earnings expectations, but they sometimes required the help of noncore businesses such as private investing. Shares of Bank of America Corp. fell after its earnings release on Tuesday as investors fretted about net interest income falling from the first quarter due in part to lower long-term bond yields. And J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., while reporting record profit, trimmed its outlook for the second half. 
Morgan Stanley's results had no such caveats, with contributions spread evenly among its traders, investment bankers and stockbrokers. 
It has been a remarkable run for the bank and its chief executive, James Gorman, who in 2010 took the reins of a firm humbled by the financial crisis and strategically adrift. His decision to de-emphasize trading and embrace wealth management -- a business he once ran for Morgan Stanley -- has paid off, producing steady growth and winning over investors who had stayed away after repeated burns.

"These changes don't happen quickly, they happen over many years," Mr. Gorman said Wednesday. "Much of it came together in this quarter. I wouldn't run a victory lap around it yet, but this is proof of the model." 
Morgan Stanley's shares rose 3.3%, bringing the firm's market value to $86.2 billion, compared with Goldman's $87.7 billion. Also contributing to the narrowing gap this week was a sharp drop in trading reported by Goldman on Tuesday. 
In some ways, both firms aren't the top players they once were. The two are now eclipsed in trading revenue by J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Bank of America, which have used their sheer size to dominate the new high-volume, low-margin trading landscape. 
The two rivals, having spent decades dueling as private partnerships, came through the financial crisis as the only two large stand-alone investment banks to survive. But Goldman emerged stronger and stuck to the strategy that made it the most envied trader on Wall Street, even while peers like J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America bulked up. 
Morgan Stanley decided it had to evolve, buying Citigroup Inc.'s Smith Barney brokerage and slashing trading businesses. The firm didn't catch up to Goldman quickly, slowly closing the gap first in revenue and then in profitability. 
For the quarter, Morgan Stanley reported a profit of $1.8 billion on revenue of $9.5 billion, both up from the year-earlier period and better than analysts had expected. 
While the second half of the year may prove tougher, the first half has been a validation of Mr. Gorman's reshaping of a firm he joined relatively late in his career. A former management consultant brought over from Merrill Lynch in 2007 to run wealth management, he ascended to the corner office after the crisis humbled Morgan Stanley's trading desk, and then-CEO John Mack, a former bond salesman, retired. 
In 2009, Mr. Mack and Mr. Gorman struck the deal to buy Smith Barney. The purchase added heft to Morgan Stanley's wealth-management business, which remained hobbled by a tumultuous 1997 merger with Dean Witter. In 2009, the business made a profit of about $280 million. This year, it is on track for $4 billion, with remarkably steady revenue. On 98% of days in 2015, the unit bringing in between $50 million and $70 million. 
That predictability is an antidote to more-volatile trading business, which the firm has been shrinking. Last year, Mr. Gorman and top lieutenant Colm Kelleher, a former trading chief, fired 25% of fixed-income traders and slashed the capital available to the unit for bets. 
Still, that division -- which trades everything from corporate bonds to oil to interest-rate swaps -- has kept revenue from falling sharply. It has made more than $1 billion in revenue for five straight quarters, hitting a goal Mr. Gorman set last year. 
On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley reported $1.2 billion in revenue from the division, outperforming Goldman for the second straight quarter thanks to strong trading in currencies and corporate debt. 
Including Morgan Stanley's stock traders, the firm reported trading revenue for the quarter of $3.2 billion compared with Goldman's $3.1 billion. 
During the first half, Morgan Stanley's overall trading revenue surpassed Goldman's for the first time since at least the financial crisis. 
Part of the story is that Goldman has stumbled. Its traders, once dominant on Wall Street, are struggling to find their footing amid sweeping market changes since the crisis. Trillions of dollars have shifted to passive funds, and then came a down spell for hedge funds as well as a long stretch of calm in the markets -- all of which have reduced demand for the complex products that are Goldman's signature. 
On Tuesday, Goldman reported trading revenue that fell 17% from a year earlier, the worst start to a year in CEO Lloyd Blankfein's 11-year tenure. Fixed-income revenue fell 40%. Shares tumbled 2.6% on Tuesday and another 0.2% Wednesday. 
Goldman has acknowledged challenges at trading business, with its Chief Financial Officer R. Martin Chavez saying in a conference call that the firm "didn't navigate the market as well as we want to," over the past year or so. It has added new clients and businesses to be more resilient in different market conditions. 
Morgan Stanley, though, has tried to avoid trading mistakes while leaning heavily on its wealth-management business. That unit reported a record $4.2 billion in revenue and hit a 25% profit-margin target, the high end of a range set by Mr. Gorman. 
"There were plenty of skeptics" on Morgan Stanley, said Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities. "They've been proving naysayers wrong."

         Morgan Stanley tops Goldman in trading again

Morgan Stanley said its second-quarter profit rose to $1.76 billion as the Wall Street firm's traders delivered strong results, topping rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the second straight quarter. Shares rose 3.5% premarket as earnings and revenue beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts. "We feel good about the decisions we've made," Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview. "To put up those numbers across the board, in a quarter where we saw fewer market events, less client activity, feels good." Morgan Stanley reported earnings of 87 cents a share. Analysts had expected 76 cents, up from 75 cents a year ago. Revenue of $9.5 billion was up from $8.91 billion in the second quarter of last year, and well ahead of analyst expectations of $9.09 billion. The bank run by Chairman and Chief Executive James Gorman is in the late stages of a multiyear turnaround that de-emphasizes volatile trading businesses in favor of more stable assets and wealth management. With the big pieces in place -- buying Citigroup Inc.'s Smith Barney brokerage, slashing risk-weighted assets, and firing hundreds of fixed-income traders -- the challenge now is to produce higher returns. Mr. Gorman has promised a 10% return on equity by year-end. The figure stood at 9.1% in the quarter. Morgan Stanley is the last of the large U.S. banks to report earnings for the second quarter, a three-month stretch of calm markets that did little to jolt Wall Street businesses. Big banks including Goldman, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Citigroup offset trading declines with gains in other businesses such as commercial lending or private-equity investing. Morgan Stanley reported a 2.1% drop in trading revenue, the smallest decline reported by any big bank this quarter. At Goldman, whose securities business most closely resembles -- and competes with -- Morgan Stanley's, trading revenue was off by 17%. The figure that stands out is $1.24 billion from trading debt, currencies and other fixed-income products. That business is traditionally a laggard for Morgan Stanley, with its smaller balance sheet and history of bungling risk. But it has been performing better over the past year following a leadership shake-up that saw its top stock trader, Ted Pick, take over all of sales and trading. This marks the fifth straight quarter of $1 billion-plus revenue, a bar set by Mr. Gorman last year, and once again tops Goldman Sachs, which continues to struggle in fixed-income trading and posted a 40% decline in that business Tuesday. Revenue was flat in stock trading, Morgan Stanley's strength. The firm has outmaneuvered peers in courting business from so-called "quant" hedge funds that trade huge volumes of stocks in fractions of a second. Morgan Stanley's wealth-management business, which manages about $2.2 trillion in client assets, took in a best-ever $4.15 billion in revenue last quarter. The unit's profit margin hit 25%, the high end of a goal set last year by Mr. Gorman, as it continues to sweep in client cash and find more profitable uses for it, like lending. Loans to wealth clients hit a record $74 billion as of June 30, with gains across all three major products: mortgages, securities-backed loans and tailored lending, Mr. Pruzan said. As interest rates rise, Morgan Stanley is hustling to lend out a surfeit of deposits it picked up in the multiyear acquisition of of SmithBarney. In investment banking, where Morgan Stanley is generally a top-three player, revenue rose 28%, as big gains in stock and debt underwriting overcame flat merger fees. Morgan Stanley's smallest division, investment management, reported revenue of $665 million, up 14% from a year ago. The business manages about $435 billion, making it about one-tenth the size of index-fund giant Vanguard Group. Unlike rivals, Morgan Stanley offers no index funds that simply mirror the performance of certain corners of the stock market. Instead, it is betting on active stock pickers who can beat the market -- a tall order lately as stock prices have churned indiscriminately higher. Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
