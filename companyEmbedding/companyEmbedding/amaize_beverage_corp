AMAIZE ™ 100% NATURAL DRINK
 
Amaize is a uniquely delicious drink, rich is color and high in antioxidants. It is based on an ancient Peruvian drink made by brewing Purple Corn and adding tropical pineapple juice and apple juice. It offers many potential health benefits. Due to high concentrations of natural purple pigments known as anthocyanins, Purple Corn is an antioxidant powerhouse. It protects cells from damage by free radicals, detoxifies, is a powerful anti-inflammatory and lowers blood pressure. Because Purple Corn's anthocyanins are stable when heated, Amaize beverage harnesses their special properties.

 
 



 
 





 


AMAIZING LEMONADES
 
Amaizing Lemonade is a 100% Natural Lemonade blended with brewed Purple Corn It is a refreshing take on one of America’s favorite beverages. We plan to extend the line to five distinct and great tasting flavors offering significantly reduced calories without the use of artificial sweeteners or coloring. Amaizing Lemonade is being formulated to contain approximately 40% fewer calories than our competitors and will be the only lemonade blended with brewed Purple Corn in the marketplace.

 
 
 




AMAIZING TEAS
 
Somewhere between the pumped-up, sugar-saturated drinks and the tasteless waters, there is a need for a healthier alternative, to provide genuine natural taste without the artificially concocted sweeteners and preservatives. Amaizing Tea allows you to enjoy the world’s second most popular drink the way hundreds of civilizations did and nature intended it to be. A world of flavor, freshly brewed and barely  sweetened, We blend tea from around the world with brewed Purple Corn and add a hint of honey or pure palm sugar. Finally, we filter Amaizing Tea to produce a pure genuine taste that doesn’t need a disguise. Unlike most of the bottled teas in the marketplace, Amaizing Tea is not made with bricks of tea dust, tea concentrate, or other artificial sweeteners or acids. The tea has no bitter aftertaste or sugar kick, and does not leave a syrupy film on the drinker’s teeth.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-0.08      Market Cap $1.51 M     Shares Outstanding 15.71 M     Public Float 3.73 M     Yield BEVS has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
