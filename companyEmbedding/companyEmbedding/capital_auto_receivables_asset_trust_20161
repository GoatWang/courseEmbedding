March 16, 2016 12:17 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned ratings to the following notes issued by 
      Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2016-1:
    

      --$247,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$105,000,000 class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$195,000,000 class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$242,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$85,660,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,360,000 class B notes 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,360,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39,900,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Characteristics: The 2016-1 pool is representative of 
      non-prime collateral, with a 633 weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. 
      (FICO) score, 9.17% WA APR and 105.00% WA loan-to-value ratio (LTV), all 
      relatively consistent with recent pools securitized.
    

      Increasing Extended Term: Of the 2016-1 initial pool, 77% contains 
      extended-term contracts, the highest level for the platform since 2014-1 
      (not rated by Fitch). Furthermore, 12% of the pool consists of contracts 
      with terms greater than 72 months.
    

      Removal of Revolving Feature: 2016-1 is the first CARAT transaction 
      since re-inception of the platform in 2013 that will not include a 
      one-year revolving feature, with certain structural features removed as 
      a result. Given this, Fitch's initial loss proxy for 2016-1 is 5.25%, 
      decreased from 5.50% in the last Fitch-rated transaction (2015-3), due 
      to the removal of risks associated with the revolving feature. The 
      recommend proxy is consistent with the proxy determined for 2015-3 prior 
      to application of additional stresses relating to the revolving 
      structure.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for 
      the class A notes totals 15.00%, down from 19.50% in the prior three 
      transactions. The reserve is 0.50% non-declining, subordination totals 
      11.40%, and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 3.10% growing to a 
      target of 5.00% of the initial pool balance. The OC target will decrease 
      to 3.00% once the A-2 floating-rate notes are paid in full. Excess 
      spread is approximately 5.79% per annum.
    

      Weakening Portfolio Performance: Delinquencies and losses for Ally 
      Financial Inc.'s (AFIN) non-prime auto loan portfolio have been 
      increasing since 2013, largely driven by weaker collateral underwriting 
      and lower recoveries from softer used vehicle values. Although trending 
      higher, performance is still well below peak levels experienced in the 
      recessionary years.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates AFIN 'BB+/B' with a 
      Stable Outlook. AFIN demonstrates solid capabilities as an originator, 
      underwriter, and servicer as evidenced by its historical prime and 
      non-prime portfolio and securitization performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of AFIN would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Capital Auto 
      Receivables Asset Trust 2016-1 to increased credit losses over the life 
      of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. We saw a 
      potential downgrade of one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base 
      case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes 
      could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories, potentially 
      leading to distressed ratings, under Fitch's severe (2.0x base case 
      loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 225 loans 
      from the statistical data file. We considered this information in our 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link at the bottom of 
      this rating action commentary (RAC).
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled 'Capital Auto Receivables 
      Asset Trust 2016-1 -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of 
      typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated March 26, 2015.

Seller and CARI that the sale, transfer, assignment and other
conveyances of the Receivables contemplated by this Agreement and
the First Step Receivables Assignment shall constitute a sale of
the Receivables from the Seller to CARI and the beneficial interest

petition by or against the Seller under any bankruptcy
law.

connection with the Receivables, any Dealer Agreements, any
insurance policies or any other agreement or instrument relating to
any of them.

Principal Balance shall be paid to the Seller in immediately
available funds and the balance of such purchase price shall be
paid through one or both of (a)Â an increase in the amount
owing from CARI to Seller under the Intercompany Advance Agreement
(as a result of an advance made thereunder from Seller to CARI) and

recorded by the Seller and CARI.

ARTICLE III

ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF
RECEIVABLES

SECTION 3.01 Duties of the
Servicer .

(a) The Servicer is hereby appointed
and authorized to act as agent for the Owner of the Receivables and
in such capacity shall manage, service, administer and process
collections on the Receivables with reasonable care, using that
degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with
respect to comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it
services for itself or others. The Servicer hereby accepts such
appointment and authorization and agrees to perform the duties of
Servicer with respect to the Receivables set forth herein and in
the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements.

(b) The Servicerâs duties
shall include collection and posting of all payments, responding to
inquiries of Obligors, investigating delinquencies, sending billing
statements to Obligors, policing the collateral, including
remarketing repossessed and returned Financed Vehicles, accounting
for collections and furnishing monthly and annual statements to the
Owner of any Receivables with respect to distributions, generating
federal income tax information and performing the other duties
specified herein. Subject to the provisions of
SectionÂ 3.02 (including the provisions regarding
âPermitted Modificationsâ set forth therein) and the
limitations set forth in SectionÂ 3.07(a)(iii) ), the
Servicer shall follow its customary standards, policies and
procedures and shall have full power and authority, acting alone,
to do any and all things in connection with such managing,
servicing, administration and collection as set forth
herein.

(c) Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered
by the Owner of the Receivables, pursuant to this
SectionÂ 3.01 , to
Â 
4


execute and deliver, on behalf of all Interested
Parties, or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or
cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all
other comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables and
the Financed Vehicles (including proceeds). The Servicer is hereby
authorized to (i)Â commence, in its own name or in the name of
the Owner of such Receivable a legal proceeding, whether through
judicial process or (with respect to repossession of a Financed
Vehicle) non-judicial process, (ii)Â participate in a voluntary
or involuntary liquidation proceeding to enforce a Liquidating
Receivable or Receivable as contemplated by
SectionÂ 3.03 , (iii)Â enforce all obligations of
the Seller, the Servicer, CARI or the Issuing Entity under this
Agreement and under the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements
or (iv)Â commence or participate in a legal proceeding
(including a bankruptcy case) relating to or involving a Receivable
or a Liquidating Receivable. If the Servicer commences or
participates in such a legal proceeding in its own name, the
Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered by the Owner of the
Receivables pursuant to this SectionÂ 3.01 to obtain
possession of the related Financed Vehicle and immediately and
without further action on the part of the Owner or the Servicer,
the Owner of such Receivable shall thereupon automatically assign
in trust such Receivable and the security interest in the related
Financed Vehicle to the Servicer for the benefit of the Interested
Parties immediately prior to such legal or liquidation proceeding
for purposes of commencing or participating in any such proceeding
as a party or claimant. Upon such automatic assignment, the
Servicer will be, and will have all the rights and duties of, a
secured party under the UCC and other applicable law with respect
to such Receivable and the related Financed Vehicle. At the
Servicerâs request from time to time, the Owner of a
Receivable assigned under this SectionÂ 3.01 shall
provide the Servicer with evidence of the assignment in trust for
the benefit of the Interested Parties as may be reasonably
necessary for the Servicer to take any of the actions set forth in
the following sentence.

(d) The Servicer is hereby
authorized and empowered by the Owner of a Receivable to execute
and deliver in the Servicerâs name any notices, demands,
claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or
instruments in connection with any such proceeding. Any Owner of
Receivables shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney
and other documents and take any other steps which the Servicer may
deem necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out
its servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement and
the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements. Except to the extent
required by the preceding two sentences, the authority and rights
granted to the Servicer in this SectionÂ 3.01 shall be
nonexclusive and shall not be construed to be in derogation of the
retention by the Owner of a Receivable of equivalent authority and
rights.

SECTION 3.02 Collection of
Receivable Payments . The Servicer shall make reasonable
efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of the Receivables as and when the same shall become due
and shall follow such collection practices, policies and procedures
as it follows with respect to comparable motor vehicle related
receivables that it services for itself or others in connection
therewith (the â Established Collection Procedures
â). Subject to the limitations provided in
SectionÂ 3.07(a)(iii) (which limitations shall remain in
effect at all times), the Servicer is hereby authorized to make any
Permitted Modifications (as defined below) without the prior
consent of the Owner of such Receivable. The Servicer is not
authorized to, and shall not, make or grant any extensions,
rebates, deferrals, alterations, amendments or adjustments on a
Receivable (collectively, â Receivable Modifications
â) unless such Receivable Modification is a Permitted
Modification.
Â 
5


â Permitted Modification â
means any Receivable Modification made pursuant to the Established
Collection Procedures with respect to which at least one of the
following conditions has been or will be satisfied: (i)Â the
Receivable Modifications, individually and collectively,
considering all Receivable Modifications proposed to be made to
such Receivable, are ministerial in nature (such as, by way of
example, the change of payment dates due from an Obligor to a
different day in the month, waiver of any prepayment charge or late
payment charge, or waiver of other fees that may be collected in
the ordinary course of servicing the Receivable); (ii)Â the
Servicer, in response to a request made by an Obligor and pursuant
to the Established Collection Procedures, provides for extensions
or deferrals of payments with respect to such Receivable to the
extent that the following conditions all apply: (a)Â such
extensions or deferrals will not exceed 90 days in the aggregate
during any 12-month period; (b)Â such extensions or deferrals
will not exceed 180 days in the aggregate during the life of such
Receivable; and (c)Â the Servicer believes that such extensions
or deferrals are appropriate or necessary to preserve the value of
such Receivable and to prevent the Receivable from going into
default (or where such Receivable is already in default, to prevent
the Receivable from becoming further impaired); (iii)Â the
Servicer provides for extensions or deferrals of payment with
respect to a Receivable which is in default and which the Servicer
believes are appropriate or necessary to preserve the value of such
Receivable and to prevent such Receivable from becoming further
impaired; or (iv)Â the Servicer has delivered an opinion to the
Issuing Entity to the effect that such Receivable Modifications
will not cause the Issuing Entity to fail to qualify as a grantor
trust for United States federal income tax purposes.

SECTION 3.03 Realization Upon
Liquidating Receivables . The Servicer shall use reasonable
efforts, consistent with its customary practices, policies and
procedures, to repossess or otherwise comparably convert the
ownership or gain control of any Financed Vehicle that it has
reasonably determined should be repossessed or otherwise converted
following a default under the Receivable secured by the Financed
Vehicle. The Servicer is authorized to follow such customary
practices, policies and procedures as it follows with respect to
comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it services for
itself or others, which customary practices, policies and
procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any
recourse to Dealers, selling the related Financed Vehicle at public
or private sale and the taking of other actions by the Servicer in
order to realize upon such a Receivable. The Servicer is hereby
authorized to exercise its discretion consistent with its customary
practices, policies and procedures and the terms of the Basic
Documents, in servicing Liquidating Receivables so as to maximize
the net collection of those Liquidating Receivables, including the
discretion to choose to sell or not to sell any of the Liquidating
Receivables itself on behalf of the Depositor or any other Owner.
The Servicer shall not be liable for any such exercise of its
discretion made in good faith and in accordance with such servicing
procedures. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any
case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the
Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with any repair or
towards the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it shall
determine in its discretion that such repair or repossession shall
increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related Receivable by
an amount greater than the amount of such expenses. The Servicer
shall be entitled to receive Liquidation Expenses with respect to
each Liquidating Receivable at such time as the Receivable becomes
a Liquidating Receivable (or as may otherwise be provided in the
Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements).

SECTION 3.04 Maintenance of
Insurance Policies . The Servicer shall, in accordance with its
customary practices, policies and procedures, require that each
Obligor shall
Â 
6


have obtained physical damage insurance covering
the Financed Vehicle as of the execution of the related Receivable.
The Servicer shall, in accordance with its customary practices,
policies and procedures, track such physical damage insurance with
respect to each Receivable.

SECTION 3.05 Maintenance of
Security Interests in Vehicles . The Servicer shall, in
accordance with its customary practices, policies and procedures
and at its own expense, take such steps as are necessary to
maintain perfection of the security interest created by each
Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. The Owner of each
Receivable hereby authorizes the Servicer to re-perfect such
security interest on behalf of such Owner, as necessary because of
the relocation of a Financed Vehicle, or for any other
reason.

SECTION 3.06 Covenants,
Representations and Warranties of the Servicer . As of the
Closing Date, the Servicer hereby makes the following
representations, warranties and covenants on which CARI relies in
accepting the Receivables hereunder and pursuant to the First Step
Receivables Assignment, and on which the Issuing Entity shall rely

Agreement and the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements, the

(iv) Binding Obligation . The
Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements and this Agreement, when
duly executed and delivered, shall constitute the legal, valid and

affecting the enforcement of creditorsâ rights in general and
by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law;

(v) No Violation . The
consummation by the Servicer of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements,

the terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or without notice
or lapse of time) a default under, the articles of incorporation or

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
