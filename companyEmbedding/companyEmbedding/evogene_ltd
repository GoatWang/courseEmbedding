- The collaboration will focus on novel microbial bio-stimulant seed treatments for the improvement of corn productivity globally


JOHNSTON, Iowa and REHOVOT, Israel, July  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DuPont Pioneer (DuPont) and Evogene Ltd (NASDAQ:EVGN) (TASE:EVGN), a leading company for the improvement of crop productivity and economics for the food, feed and biofuel industries, announced today that they have entered into a multiyear collaboration. The scope of the agreement includes the research and development of microbiome-based seed treatments in corn. The goal of the collaboration is to provide farmers with innovative bio-stimulant seed treatment products that protect and maximize corn yield by leveraging each other’s relevant market-leading technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, DuPont will provide access to its extensive seed treatment application technology and product development expertise. Evogene will apply its predictive computational biology platform to decipher plant/microbiome interactions along with its microbial formulation and fermentation technologies. The combination of these key capabilities increases the opportunity to fully activate the potential of the emerging field of microbiome-based seed treatment products. “This is an important step forward in our efforts to discover, develop and provide advanced seed-applied technologies,” said Neal Gutterson, vice president, Research & Development, DuPont Pioneer. “Our relationship with Evogene is consistent with our history of collaboration to advance science-based customer solutions and our open innovation strategy.” Ofer Haviv, Evogene's president and CEO added: "We believe microbiome-based biologicals will be an important and valuable tool for farmers in driving agricultural productivity. Evogene’s biological predictive technology platform drives research and development of such novel ag-biological solutions and generates significant positive outcomes. We are extremely pleased and proud to collaborate with agriculture leader DuPont Pioneer – a collaboration which will improve our potential for success and reduce our time to market.” Ag-biologicals represent a growing approach for driving agriculture productivity and are increasingly adopted by farmers to complement the existing solutions of improved seed traits and crop protection chemistry. The bio-stimulant market is an evolving segment with immense potential and estimated by MarketsandMarkets™ in 2016 at over $1.6 billion with a projected annual growth rate of approximately 10 percent. 1 Microbiomes are microbial communities that reside on or within the plant's immediate microbial environment and play a significant role in plant health. Bio-stimulants are agricultural biologic products, which increase crop yield and resilience to environmental (abiotic) stress by enhancing desirable plant characteristics and promoting efficient use of nutrient inputs. By leveraging the understanding of the complex plant/microbiome interaction, the parties will work to develop a next generation of bio-stimulant products aimed at demonstrating high standards for performance and consistency criteria across a range of corn varieties and global locations. Product development efforts under the collaboration will utilize, as a starting point, Evogene’s proprietary microbe combinations which are already identified and validated in field testing to have significant positive impact on key crop characteristics, including yield productivity as previously disclosed by Evogene in 2016. The multi-year collaboration has an extension option if certain milestones are met. Pioneer will obtain worldwide marketing rights for any products, with milestone payments and royalties to be paid to Evogene. Specific financial terms and additional details of the agreement were not disclosed. ___________________ 1 Based on the report of Market & Markets, May 2016 http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/biostimulant.asp  Evogene (NASDAQ:EVGN) (TASE:EVGN) is a leading biotechnology company for the improvement of crop productivity.

Merger of EqualsOn December 11, 2015, DuPont and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) announced entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended on March 31, 2017 and as may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms, (the “Merger Agreement”) under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger (the “Merger Transaction”), subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval. Dow and DuPont have obtained conditional approval for the Merger Transaction from the antitrust regulatory authorities in the United States, Brazil, Canada and China, among others. The conditional approvals were granted based on the companies fulfilling their commitments to divest certain assets, among other conditions, (the “Conditional Commitments”). In connection with the Conditional Commitments, DuPont entered into a definitive agreement (the “FMC Transaction Agreement”) with FMC Corporation (FMC). Under the FMC Transaction Agreement subject to the closing of the Merger Transaction in addition to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval, FMC will acquire certain Crop Protection business and R&D assets from DuPont and DuPont has agreed to acquire certain assets relating to FMC’s Health and Nutrition segment, (collectively, the “FMC Transactions”). The combined company will be DowDuPont Inc. DuPont and Dow intend, following consummation of the Merger Transaction, that DowDuPont Inc. will pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the board of directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company’s agriculture business, specialty products business, and materials science business through a series of tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the “Intended Business Separations”). For more information, please see DuPont’s latest annual, quarterly and current reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, as well as the joint proxy/prospectus included in the DowDuPont Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed in connection with the Merger Transaction.

Positive Fusarium resistance achieved with Evogene discovered genes Evogene also announces completion of candidate gene discovery stage in Monsanto yield and abiotic stress collaboration  REHOVOT, Israel, July  11, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evogene Ltd. (NASDAQ:EVGN) (TASE:EVGN), a leading company for the improvement of crop productivity and economics for food, feed and biofuel industries, announced today that the company reached an important milestone in its crop disease collaboration with Monsanto Company with the demonstration of positive Fusarium resistance results with Evogene discovered genes. Additionally, Evogene announced the completion of the candidate gene discovery stage in the companies’ yield and abiotic stress collaboration, which mainly focuses on corn and soy. The crop disease collaboration program is focused on the discovery of candidate genes predicted to provide resistance to Stalk Rot disease caused by multiple Fusarium species. Fusarium is a family of fungi that causes yield loss across many of the world’s major crops, including corn and wheat.  In model plant validation testing, Evogene discovered genes were successful in showing resistance to Fusarium, and the top prioritized genes are now advancing to testing in Monsanto’s corn pipeline. Evogene also announced that in its yield and abiotic stress collaboration with Monsanto for the development of improved seed traits primarily in corn and soy, Evogene successfully completed the gene discovery stage, and the collaboration will now focus on progressing selected gene candidates through additional testing in Monsanto’s product development pipeline. During the recently completed gene discovery phase of the collaboration, Evogene identified approximately 4,000 genes predicted to be associated with individual plant traits. "We are very pleased to announce these positive results in our disease resistance program in seed traits and the completion, according to plan, of the discovery phase in our yield and abiotic stress program with Monsanto," said Ofer Haviv, Evogene's President and CEO. "This progress again demonstrates the power and versatility of our unique predictive discovery platform. Most importantly, we are confident that the continuing progress in our multiple areas of collaboration with Monsanto, combining our efforts with Monsanto’s world-class development and commercialization capabilities will lead to novel end products.” "Monsanto is excited about its continued partnership with Evogene," said Tom Adams, VP Global Biotechnology at Monsanto, "Through the partnership, Monsanto is gaining access to novel genes that have the potential to reveal new mechanisms for disease control in crops that could have a significant impact on our product pipeline and agriculture." About Evogene Ltd.:Evogene (NASDAQ:EVGN) (TASE:EVGN) is a leading biotechnology company for the improvement of crop productivity.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

DuPont Pioneer & Evogene Announce Multiyear Research Collaboration for Development of Corn Bio-Stimulant Products
The collaboration will focus on novel microbial bio-stimulant seed treatments for the improvement of corn productivity globally



















July 26, 2017 07:00 ET

 | Source: Evogene






JOHNSTON, Iowa and REHOVOT, Israel, July  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DuPont Pioneer (DuPont) and Evogene Ltd (NASDAQ:EVGN) (TASE:EVGN), a leading company for the improvement of crop productivity and economics for the food, feed and biofuel industries, announced today that they have entered into a multiyear collaboration. The scope of the agreement includes the research and development of microbiome-based seed treatments in corn. The goal of the collaboration is to provide farmers with innovative bio-stimulant seed treatment products that protect and maximize corn yield by leveraging each other’s relevant market-leading technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, DuPont will provide access to its extensive seed treatment application technology and product development expertise. Evogene will apply its predictive computational biology platform to decipher plant/microbiome interactions along with its microbial formulation and fermentation technologies. The combination of these key capabilities increases the opportunity to fully activate the potential of the emerging field of microbiome-based seed treatment products. “This is an important step forward in our efforts to discover, develop and provide advanced seed-applied technologies,” said Neal Gutterson, vice president, Research & Development, DuPont Pioneer. “Our relationship with Evogene is consistent with our history of collaboration to advance science-based customer solutions and our open innovation strategy.” Ofer Haviv, Evogene's president and CEO added: "We believe microbiome-based biologicals will be an important and valuable tool for farmers in driving agricultural productivity. Evogene’s biological predictive technology platform drives research and development of such novel ag-biological solutions and generates significant positive outcomes. We are extremely pleased and proud to collaborate with agriculture leader DuPont Pioneer – a collaboration which will improve our potential for success and reduce our time to market.” Ag-biologicals represent a growing approach for driving agriculture productivity and are increasingly adopted by farmers to complement the existing solutions of improved seed traits and crop protection chemistry. The bio-stimulant market is an evolving segment with immense potential and estimated by MarketsandMarkets™ in 2016 at over $1.6 billion with a projected annual growth rate of approximately 10 percent. 1 Microbiomes are microbial communities that reside on or within the plant's immediate microbial environment and play a significant role in plant health. Bio-stimulants are agricultural biologic products, which increase crop yield and resilience to environmental (abiotic) stress by enhancing desirable plant characteristics and promoting efficient use of nutrient inputs. By leveraging the understanding of the complex plant/microbiome interaction, the parties will work to develop a next generation of bio-stimulant products aimed at demonstrating high standards for performance and consistency criteria across a range of corn varieties and global locations. Product development efforts under the collaboration will utilize, as a starting point, Evogene’s proprietary microbe combinations which are already identified and validated in field testing to have significant positive impact on key crop characteristics, including yield productivity as previously disclosed by Evogene in 2016. The multi-year collaboration has an extension option if certain milestones are met. Pioneer will obtain worldwide marketing rights for any products, with milestone payments and royalties to be paid to Evogene. Specific financial terms and additional details of the agreement were not disclosed. ___________________ 1 Based on the report of Market & Markets, May 2016 http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/biostimulant.asp  Evogene (NASDAQ:EVGN) (TASE:EVGN) is a leading biotechnology company for the improvement of crop productivity.

Activity[edit]
Evogene focuses on four key fields for its future growth: I. Improving yield and abiotic stress tolerance traits for key agricultural crops. II.Improving disease, insects and other biotic stress resistance traits III. agrochemistry (the interface between chemicals and plants) IV. Develop non-food feedstock for biodiesel through its subsidiary, Evofuel.
The company employs about 200 workers in various fields, of them 85% are engaged in research and development. The multidisciplinary team includes computer experts, biologists, geneticists, agronomists and others. Evogene has its main offices and compound of laboratories in Rehovot, Israel. The company also has greenhouses and other plant growing sites throughout Israel.
The company cooperates with some of the leading seed companies around the world, among them, Syngenta, DuPont, Monsanto and Bayer CropScience, in order to develop and commercialize its technology.
Technology[edit]
Evogene's performs the biotechnological procedure of seed development in several stages. For this end, the company has been developing computational technology for detecting genes and DNA sequences that could improve one or more of the certain plant's qualities. The company's method of work starts with mapping and prioritizing the genes, then examining the impact of these genes and gene sequences on the plant in order to improve actual features of the certain plant. The company focuses on agricultural and industrial needs and also on the alternative energy industry.
As of December 2012, Evogene has four main technologies: ATHLETE™ - Evogene's proprietary computational technology for plant gene discovery; Gene2Product™ - a number of proprietary computational genomic components to improve trait efficacy and the probability of successful development of biotechnology seed products; Evobreed™ - a computational technology for discovery of molecular markers to enhance plant breeding; and PoinTar™ - a computational platform for target discovery, aimed at identifying proteins that are important to plant function and performance. The company plans to enter new fields, such as RNA-based gene regulation and to explore the benefits of reducing the impact of certain genes.
Evogene as a public company[edit]
The company's shares are traded on Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and is a member of the TA-100 Index, the TA BlueTech Index and the TA-Biomed Index. The company does not have a controlling stock holder: Monsanto holds 9% of the company's shares, Leon Recanati holds 5%, Compugen holds 3%, Chairman Martin Gerstel holds 2% and the rest 81% are held by the general public.

Evogene focuses on four key fields for its future growth: I. Improving yield and abiotic stress tolerance traits for key agricultural crops. II.Improving disease, insects and other biotic stress resistance traits III. agrochemistry (the interface between chemicals and plants) IV. Develop non-food feedstock for biodiesel through its subsidiary, Evofuel.
The company employs about 200 workers in various fields, of them 85% are engaged in research and development. The multidisciplinary team includes computer experts, biologists, geneticists, agronomists and others. Evogene has its main offices and compound of laboratories in Rehovot, Israel. The company also has greenhouses and other plant growing sites throughout Israel.
The company cooperates with some of the leading seed companies around the world, among them, Syngenta, DuPont, Monsanto and Bayer CropScience, in order to develop and commercialize its technology.
Technology[edit]
Evogene's performs the biotechnological procedure of seed development in several stages. For this end, the company has been developing computational technology for detecting genes and DNA sequences that could improve one or more of the certain plant's qualities. The company's method of work starts with mapping and prioritizing the genes, then examining the impact of these genes and gene sequences on the plant in order to improve actual features of the certain plant. The company focuses on agricultural and industrial needs and also on the alternative energy industry.
As of December 2012, Evogene has four main technologies: ATHLETE™ - Evogene's proprietary computational technology for plant gene discovery; Gene2Product™ - a number of proprietary computational genomic components to improve trait efficacy and the probability of successful development of biotechnology seed products; Evobreed™ - a computational technology for discovery of molecular markers to enhance plant breeding; and PoinTar™ - a computational platform for target discovery, aimed at identifying proteins that are important to plant function and performance. The company plans to enter new fields, such as RNA-based gene regulation and to explore the benefits of reducing the impact of certain genes.
Evogene as a public company[edit]
The company's shares are traded on Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and is a member of the TA-100 Index, the TA BlueTech Index and the TA-Biomed Index. The company does not have a controlling stock holder: Monsanto holds 9% of the company's shares, Leon Recanati holds 5%, Compugen holds 3%, Chairman Martin Gerstel holds 2% and the rest 81% are held by the general public. In June 2013, the company submitted a draft prospectus to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ahead of its public offering at the New York Stock Exchange. The Shares began trading on November 2013 [1].

Evogene Ltd. (Hebrew: אבוג'ן‎‎) is an Israeli company engaged in research and development for improving crop quality, productivity and economics, through application of plant genomics,[1] for the food, feed and biofuel industries. The Company has strategic collaborations with world-leading agricultural companies to develop improved seed traits in relation to yield and a-biotic stress (such as tolerance to drought), and biotic stress (such as resistance to disease), in key crops as corn, soybean, wheat and rice.

Activity[edit]
Evogene focuses on four key fields for its future growth: I. Improving yield and abiotic stress tolerance traits for key agricultural crops. II.Improving disease, insects and other biotic stress resistance traits III. agrochemistry (the interface between chemicals and plants) IV. Develop non-food feedstock for biodiesel through its subsidiary, Evofuel.
The company employs about 200 workers in various fields, of them 85% are engaged in research and development. The multidisciplinary team includes computer experts, biologists, geneticists, agronomists and others. Evogene has its main offices and compound of laboratories in Rehovot, Israel. The company also has greenhouses and other plant growing sites throughout Israel.
The company cooperates with some of the leading seed companies around the world, among them, Syngenta, DuPont, Monsanto and Bayer CropScience, in order to develop and commercialize its technology.
Technology[edit]
Evogene's performs the biotechnological procedure of seed development in several stages. For this end, the company has been developing computational technology for detecting genes and DNA sequences that could improve one or more of the certain plant's qualities. The company's method of work starts with mapping and prioritizing the genes, then examining the impact of these genes and gene sequences on the plant in order to improve actual features of the certain plant. The company focuses on agricultural and industrial needs and also on the alternative energy industry.
As of December 2012, Evogene has four main technologies: ATHLETE™ - Evogene's proprietary computational technology for plant gene discovery; Gene2Product™ - a number of proprietary computational genomic components to improve trait efficacy and the probability of successful development of biotechnology seed products; Evobreed™ - a computational technology for discovery of molecular markers to enhance plant breeding; and PoinTar™ - a computational platform for target discovery, aimed at identifying proteins that are important to plant function and performance. The company plans to enter new fields, such as RNA-based gene regulation and to explore the benefits of reducing the impact of certain genes.
Evogene as a public company[edit]
The company's shares are traded on Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and is a member of the TA-100 Index, the TA BlueTech Index and the TA-Biomed Index. The company does not have a controlling stock holder: Monsanto holds 9% of the company's shares, Leon Recanati holds 5%, Compugen holds 3%, Chairman Martin Gerstel holds 2% and the rest 81% are held by the general public.

Seed traits






The global seed market is a $37B market, as of 2016, of which 53% is attributed to available biotech seeds, seeds which have been improved by gene transformation, in crops such as corn, soy and cotton. Currently available biotech seed traits capture approximately $8B and it is expected that as additional traits become available, the market may reach $14B1, thus attempting to provide a solution to improve traits such as yield, abiotic stress, disease resistance, insect control and herbicide tolerance.
As global seed companies constantly aim to reach beyond current limitations to address the world’s growing need for feed, food and fuel, Evogene forges collaborations with these global companies to discover genes and genomic element to develop improved seed traits.
The key traits Evogene targets are:

Improved yield
Resistance to abiotic/environmental stress (e.g. drought…)
Nutrient uptake (N2)
Insect control
Disease resistance

At Evogene, we discover and develop improved seed traits, focusing on the world’s major field crops: corn, soy, wheat, rice, cotton, canola and more. Following over a decade of discovery and research into seed traits, Evogene now aims to provide a comprehensive solution of an overall package to enhance the performance of various crops.
Evogene utilizes proprietary computational platforms, ATHLETE, Gene2Product, PlaNet NG and BiomeMiner, to identify target genes and additional genomic elements, leveraging both plant and microbial gene pools including meta-genomic approaches.
Likewise, Evogene has put into place state-of-the-art validation systems for each of its key traits, to support various product development stages. Evogene’s R&D facilities in Israel and in its St. Louis US site conduct discovery and validation with multi-disciplinary scientific teams to address global agricultural challenges.
Constantly evolving innovation – Genome Editing
The next frontier in genomics value capturing, gaining high traction in multiple areas in both pharma and agriculture, is Genome Editing technology, which allows the specific modification, at the molecular level, of essentially any given genome, in a highly precise and targeted manner.
Leveraging on Evogene’s unique technological infrastructure and significant accumulated Big Data, allows the company the ability to precisely identify required edits in the genome. Thereby, opening a new spectrum of opportunities for seed trait improvement.

Ag-Chemicals






Ag-chemicals are an essential part in the farmer’s agronomical practices and are broadly used to control weeds, insects and disease. The Ag-Chemical market in 2015 was estimated at $50B, 42% of which is attributed to herbicides, 28% to insecticides and 27% to fungicides (others are 3%), with an expected growth of 13.6% till 2021, reaching a total market of 56.7$B2.
Over the last few years, farmers have been faced with a significant increase in resistance to existing chemical products. This reality creates a pressing need for novel products that will secure crop yields in the coming years.
Evogene’s Ag-Chemical program aims to provide chemical based products including herbicides, insecticides and fungicides.
Currently, Evogene’s Ag-Chemical product programs are divided into:

Novel herbicides based on a new target (an essential molecule for plant vitality).
Novel insecticides focused on new sites of action for existing targets (an essential molecule for insect vitality).
Active ingredient optimization for the improvement of existing products (efficacy improvement, toxicity etc.) through the discovery of new patentable chemistry.

Evogene’s Ag-Chemical activity combines state-of-the-art target-based computational chemistry capabilities with plant genomics ‘big data’ and extensive chemical and biological know-how for the development of Ag-Chemical solutions with a novel biological mechanism.
Two proprietary computational platforms are employed in Evogene’s Ag-Chemical program: the PoinTar platform for identification of novel protein-targets in plants and the PointHit platform for target-based chemistry discovery.
Our platforms’ computational predictions are then further validated in exclusive biological screening systems, including lab and greenhouse screening of weeds, crops and major insect orders, such as: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hemiptera.
Lab screening is conducted at our Saint Louis facility, focused on insecticidal screens of small chemical molecules with several target insects and assay types available.
Supporting these screening efforts are interdisciplinary teams of scientists from diverse backgrounds such as: chemistry, agronomy, structural biology, computer science etc.

Ag-Biologicals






Ag biologicals are products based on the impact of plant extracts or the plant’s microbial environment on its health. The naturally occurring micro-organisms or extracts, support plants by either repelling pests or by mediating plants’ response to their environment and thereby optimizing yield potential.
The Ag biological market is an evolving segment with immense potential, estimated3 in 2015 at $3.2 billion with projected annual growth rate of approximately 11.5%. One of the key opportunities of this market is that these products supplement the existing solutions of improved seed traits and protective chemicals.
Evogene’s Ag Biological program aims to provide global agriculture with biological solutions based on novel microbiome research, targeting new and additional types of benefits, and crops, as well as address different types of application methods (e.g. seed treatment, foliar, drench).
Evogene’s Ag Biological solutions target agriculture’s main challenges – the enhancement and protection of crop yields. These solutions can be divided into:

Biostimulants which increase yield and crop resilience to abiotic/ environmental stress (salinity, weather and drought) by enhancing desirable plant traits and improving nutrient uptake.
Biopesticides which protect crops from biotic stress (insects, weeds and diseases).

Evogene’s unique approach combines Big Data, superior predictive analysis tools and strong plant understanding to efficiently capture microbial based innovation.
Over the years, Evogene has developed a comprehensive set of capabilities, centered on its world-class predictive computational systems that are geared towards the development of novel ag-biologicals, with special focus given to the proprietary MicroBiomeMiner platform.  Other capabilities include unique procedures and strategies for microbe sourcing, advanced enrichment practices, diversity-improving microbial isolation methods, proprietary genetic tools and platforms as well as bio-assays and phenotyping.
Harnessing our propriety plant and microbial ‘big data’ hub and predictive computational platform, Evogene can address yield and bio-control challenges on multiple crops simultaneously.
