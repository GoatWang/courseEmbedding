Redpoint’s first China fund hits $180m target

By Jack Hammond -  October 14, 2016 184 






Redpoint Ventures has collected $180m for its debut China Fund, AltAssets understands.
ACE Redpoint Ventures China I has landed commitments from 25 unnamed LPs according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange.
With the fund hitting the $180m total offering amount, it appears that the filing represents a final close, however, the firm has not officially confirmed if this is the case.
A spokesperson for Redpoint was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment.
Founded in 1999, Redpoint Ventures backs seed, early stage, and growth startups.
Its previous investment include 2U, HomeAway, Heroku, Just-Eat, Netflix, PureStorage, Stripe, Twilio, and Zendesk, among others.
The China fund will be managed by partners David Yuan, Tony Wu and Reggie Zhang according to the filing.
Yuan launched Redpoint China in 2005, with offices in Beijing and Shanghai.
Prior to joining Redpoint, he co-founded and served as CEO of iTelco Communications, a technology and solution provider.

Redpoint’s first China fund hits $180m target

By Jack Hammond -  October 14, 2016 185 






Redpoint Ventures has collected $180m for its debut China Fund, AltAssets understands.
ACE Redpoint Ventures China I has landed commitments from 25 unnamed LPs according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange.
With the fund hitting the $180m total offering amount, it appears that the filing represents a final close, however, the firm has not officially confirmed if this is the case.
A spokesperson for Redpoint was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment.
Founded in 1999, Redpoint Ventures backs seed, early stage, and growth startups.
Its previous investment include 2U, HomeAway, Heroku, Just-Eat, Netflix, PureStorage, Stripe, Twilio, and Zendesk, among others.
The China fund will be managed by partners David Yuan, Tony Wu and Reggie Zhang according to the filing.
Yuan launched Redpoint China in 2005, with offices in Beijing and Shanghai.
Prior to joining Redpoint, he co-founded and served as CEO of iTelco Communications, a technology and solution provider.
Wu joined Redpoint in 2015having gained over eight years of experience in technology investing with a focus on consumer, mobile and intelligent hardware.
He previously worked at Northern Light Venture Capital and Shand Strategic Investment where he backed more than ten high growth companies including 3w Ku6, Moji, Anzhi, Iapppay, Talkingdata, Apus and ITjuzi.
Prior to joining Redpoint China in 2010, Zhang worked in China for Infineon Technologies, a global semiconductor company.

The new fund will invest in about 25 companies with initial investments expected to average US$1-4 million, according to the firm.Also Read: Alibaba Cloud partners with Infocomm Investments to bridge SE Asia’s and China’s ecosystem“With offices in Beijing and Shanghai, Redpoint China will help Chinese entrepreneurs build successful companies by providing access to Redpoint’s global network, domain expertise and capital,” according to a company statement.Upon the new funding, Redpoint China will run as an independent fund rather than a branch of the global entity, Daivid Yuan noted.Since 2005, Redpoint Ventures has actively invested in over 35 companies in China. It has achieved a number of successful exits, including Cgen Digital (acquired by Focus Media), Qihoo 360 (NYSE IPO), iDreamSky (Nasdaq IPO), and Domob (acquired by Blue Focus).Also Read: IoT startup Ayla scores US$39M investment to expand in Japan, China and TaiwanMore recently, Redpoint has invested in high profile startup companies, including mobile video platform Yixia, APUS, one of the fastest growing Android apps and platforms globally; and Renrenche, a top C2C used-car marketplace in China.
