FAQ:
How often do you post themes?
Whenever I can. I don't have a set schedule. Since I'm doing these just for fun, there could be giant breaks in between theme posts. But if you send me a request, I can make something for you sooner!
Can I use your theme as a base code?
Dude, if it suits your needs, I'm totally cool with helping you out. Just drop me and ask and let me know so I can look at the finished product! And also, keep a comment in the code saying it's my original code. You know, help me back.
Can I edit your themes?
Totally! Go nuts! Just leave the credits!
Can you give me a tutorial on x, y, z?
If I know how, I will help you in any way I can! Just drop it off in the request page and I'll post it, or get back to you if I'm not confident enough to help.
If this hasn't answered your question, drop it down below, or send me an email!



The Ask Box:
Here's my ask box! It goes to my main blog so I can see it quickly and easily. Ask anything you'd like and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. If I don't respond quickly, send it again, it could've gotten eaten.

Try your best not to ask anonymously. It'll be much easier to find your reply if you don't because I'll answer privately.


The Submit Box:
Here's my submit box! Send me screenshots or long messages of anything you need help with here!



Other Ways To Contact:
I've also created an email just for people to contact me about questions. Don't worry, it forwards to my personal so I'll get it ASAP and reply to you. The email is zeldacrazey@gmail.com.










Rules:


You Can
Use my themes for any purpose.
Show me all your cool creations!
Edit them all you want!
Use them as base codes as long as you grab my permission first.
Use parts of my codes as long as you grab my permission first.
Ask me for help all you want!


You Can't:
Claim my themes as your own!
Remove the credit from my themes!
Kill me if you find mistakes, because I'm only human, you know?
Steal my code without asking.
Yeah, otherwise you're free to go!
If you actually read this, thanks a bunch, it means a lot to me.

How To Request A Theme:
Please fill out this form as best as you can to help me determine what kind of theme you'd like. But if you have a set design in mind, skip the questions and just describe it to me! I’ll try to match it as best as I can. Any layout drawings would be amazing as well.
#1. Do you have a theme motif?
Do you have something you want all in your design? For example, if your blog is all about the television show “Spongebob Squarepants”, you’d probably want a lot of yellow and squares, right?
#2. How many columns?
Do you want one, two, or three columns? Or the choice to have whichever one you want whenever?
#3. What post size?
Do you want your posts to be 250, 400, or 500 pixels wide?
#4. How many links?
How many custom links would you like? Do you want a popup block to reveal more? Or drop down menus?
#5. How many images?
Would you like them on the sidebar or a render on the side? Also, how big would you like them to be? Medium-sized, huge, or small?
#6. How many, if any, sidebars?
Would you like one sidebar, two? Or not one at all? A header and footer? Just a header? Be creative.
#7. What about your description?
Want it in a long box, wide box, short box, or even a circle? Want there to be a scrollbar for it?
#8. Do you want infinite scroll?
Would you like infinite scroll or pagination? Jump pagination or just buttons?
#9. Want any extras? 
Would you like a music box? Or monocrhome images or an updates tab?
#10. How would you like to style the post information?
Like/Reblog buttons? Tags to be shown? Would you like it to be on the side, bottom, or show when you hover?
If you can think of anything else that would help get the design you want that would be great. I’m welcome to do as many as people want. If you want to request a page theme, try to fill out as much as possible that fits it. I hope you enjoy my themes!

Also let me know if you want your theme to be a private or public theme! (Only for you or for everyone).

I will send you the details to your theme when it is finished.


Send in your request:




Or email it to me:
If you don't trust the submit box, or think an email is easier, send it here zeldacrazey@gmail.com.

Hi Din
My site is finished. but when I try to make the site live the sub menu’s stop working (mega-menu). Why is this happening. Have a look: http://www.capeoutback.co.za/dev/ and http://www.capeoutback.co.za/index.php – it also seems that the slideshow is not working either, its not loading pics.

Do have enabled Joomla! core caches or the T3 caches? Or do you have enabled both of them? Please use one of them , my recommendation is to use Joomla! core caching. And pls clear all caching.

Hi
Ok something  VERY  strange is happening. I have a folder within my root folder with all the site files and site is live (I pointed this url www.capeoutback.co.za/dev/ to: www.capeoutback.co.za), but if I load these files directly to my root folder the site does not work completely and it seem that it does not write the jquery script. – have a look: www.capeoutback.co.za/index.php.
Compare the two scripts and you will see:
  <base href=”http://www.capeoutback.co.za/dev/index.php” />

Why is this happening  and how can I fix this so that I can copy all files to my root folder so that slide show and dropdown menus work.
Please help.

It is really very fishy! Why this is happening! It just made me curious. In the demo that I have installed is working perfectly. Then why it is happening to you! Do have enabled Joomla! core caches or the T3 caches? Or do you have enabled both of them? Please use one of them , my recommendation is to use Joomla! core caching. And pls clear all caching.

Hi Din
I solved the problem, but its not the cache. You have to switch of the Optimize  CSS  and Optimize JS in the Template manager. However this still did not fix the issue of the Latest News module (which I made main sposors) in  IE9 . Please view it on test site at bottom above Footer: http://sa4.trial.co.za/ – I send you a PM with login details to my site you can use the same for this url if you can maybe see why this is happening.

Hi,
I was wondering if there is any way to remove the white box and the fading box on the images? It also seems that .png files will not show up properly in articles.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much.

Hi, 
Do you have an updated version that works well with Joomla 2.5? I downloaded and upgraded to J2.5 and several things didn’t work as they should. The slideshows were missing pictures, in IE the css was broke on the portfolio slideshows, the dropdown links aren’t functioning correctly on the mainmenu, etc…
Is there a better way to upgrade that won’t break the template?
Thanks

Hi Dmsumon, thank you for updating the package. I’ve quickly set up the new download just before leaving for work and noticed that the mega menu doesn’t work and the slideshow on the home page doesn’t load.
I haven’t had time to trouble shoot it but figured I would drop a line to give feedback since you just released it.
The mega menu isn’t dropping down. You can click the links but non of the sub-links show.

I’m not sure if my message went through, as I don’t see it on the board!  I am having a major problem with the menu and slide shows, which I believe must be something to do with jquery. I have spent hours trying to come up with a solution.  I am using Joomla 2.5, and it is hosted with Go Daddy.  I have tried all the .htaccess updates, config updates etc.  I added jquery easy to try to deal with any conflicts, but it still isn’t working.  I have gone through all of the problems listed above, along with other forums to come up with a solution with no luck.  Can you please take a look at my site:  www.richwebdesign.ca
Thanks for your time.
