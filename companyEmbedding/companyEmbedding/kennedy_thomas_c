These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

He Was No Jack Kennedy


By Robert Dallek;


Published: June 2, 1991









                    A QUESTION OF CHARACTER    A Life of John F. Kennedy. By Thomas C. Reeves. Illustrated. 510 pp. New York: The Free Press. $24.95.        

                    What are we to believe about John F. Kennedy? Was he the shining intellectual who, in the words of Arthur Schlesinger Jr., "gave his country back to its best self" and "transformed the American spirit"? Or was he the self-indulgent womanizer, the opportunist and scoundrel portrayed in so many recent exposes of the Kennedys?        

                    In "A Question of Character," Thomas C. Reeves, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin, Parkside, and the author of biographies of President Chester A. Arthur and Senator Joseph McCarthy, comes down emphatically on the side of the iconoclasts. Mr. Reeves's Kennedy is a compulsive womanizer, a liar, a bully, an amphetamine addict -- a ruthless, lazy, corrupt, self-indulgent hypocrite. He was America's first successful television politician. Television magnified his surface attributes -- his good looks, warmth and humor -- and helped turn him into a national hero leading the country on to a new frontier.        

                    The Kennedy in "A Question of Character" was, like his father, Joseph Kennedy, a man of bad character. He was the product of an emotionally impoverished childhood. He suffered from an "inability to love or express feelings." He grew up "hostile . . . toward marriage and the family. Women were at best sex objects." Chasing women became "a career." His Navy heroics on PT 109 during World War II were the invention of publicists. He was not a particularly good commander and, Mr. Reeves says, his poor judgment contributed to the sinking of his boat and the death of two crewmen.        

                    Though Kennedy emphatically denied it throughout his life, his father played the decisive part in pushing him into politics. He was a lazy Congressman, Mr. Reeves says, who spent much of his time seducing secretaries and airline hostesses. His father had to manage his finances; he surrounded himself with obsequious friends, whom he bullied, and he showed no interest in any political issue. When he ran for the Senate in 1952, his only concern was winning: "Jack, like his father and his brother  [ Robert ] , was without any guiding intellectual, philosophical, or moral vision in his pursuit of office. Politics, like life, was about winning, and little else."        

                    Spurred by his father's ambition to run for President, he pulled out all the stops to win. His successful campaign in 1960, Mr. Reeves writes, "involved the cynical manipulation of issues, unrestrained spending, vote fraud, the Mafia, ceaseless adultery, and dishonesty about Kennedy's intellectual achievements and physical condition."        

                    Mr. Reeves's portrait of Kennedy as President is no less scathing. In the White House, his bad character played a major part in making him a poor President. He had little interest in domestic affairs, made a number of bad judicial appointments, demonstrated cautious opportunism in dealing with pressing civil rights questions and fouled up royally in dealing with the Bay of Pigs invasion and escalating American involvement in Vietnam. Whatever his superficial attributes, as President, Kennedy "was pragmatic to the point of amorality; his sole standard seemed to be political expediency. . . . Jack's character . . . lacked a moral center, a reference point that went beyond self-aggrandizement." Mr. Reeves believes that if Kennedy had lived and won a second term, his lechery and dealings with Mafia figures might have become public knowledge and led to his impeachment.        

                    What are we to make of Mr. Reeves's case against Kennedy? Does he add anything to the revisionist attack on his character? Not in the least. His allegations are almost exclusively drawn from books and articles that have appeared in the last 30 years; nothing here can be described as research in primary sources. For all Mr. Reeves knows, the allegations about Kennedy's unethical behavior are largely or partly fiction. It is, of course, possible that much of what Mr. Reeves records is true. There has been so much written about Kennedy's womanizing, for example, that there seems more here than just the imaginings of scandalmongers eager for a best seller. But Mr. Reeves does nothing to help us discriminate between fact and fiction. At best, his book is a summing up of revisionist assertions about Kennedy's character flaws.        

                    And do we learn anything about Kennedy's White House term from Mr. Reeves? Not that I can detect. The 170 pages he devotes to the Presidency in this 500-page book break no new ground. But then his research -- aside from some oral histories and an occasional interview -- was too limited to expand our knowledge. With some justification, he complains about the limits on what researchers can get at in the Kennedy records. But Mr. Reeves would do well to read Irving Bernstein's recent book, "Promises Kept," to see what a skillful historian can achieve by studying the available manuscripts in the John F. Kennedy Library.        

                    In fairness to Mr. Reeves, one has to acknowledge that his purpose was less to find new materials than to say something about the impact of character on political leadership. "Good character," he writes, "is an essential framework for the complex mixture of qualities that make an outstanding President and a model leader for a democratic people." And "the real Kennedy -- as opposed to the celebrated hero espoused by the Kennedy family, the media, and the Camelot School -- lacked greatness in large part because he lacked the qualities inherent in good character."        

                    Mr. Reeves's point -- that a President's behavior can demean the Presidency and lower respect for the nation's highest office -- is well taken. Nor can one justify Presidential transgressions by acknowledging that American politics has not been notable for its saints. Still, a good character has never guaranteed Presidential greatness, just as a flawed character has not precluded it. Were it otherwise, Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter would stand in the front rank of American Presidents and Lyndon Johnson's domestic achievements would be impossible to explain.        

                    Indeed, even Mr. Reeves admits that success in resolving the Cuban missile crisis "is ultimately attributable to  [ Kennedy's ]  leadership." His behavior "revealed a deeper concern for the nation and the world than many who knew him well might have suspected." Mr. Reeves believes that "a growing maturity" made the difference in Kennedy's achievement. Perhaps. But it seems more convincing to believe that his better side was there all along and that Mr. Reeves's portrait is too fixed on Kennedy's failings to give us the full man.        

                    Since Mr. Reeves's book advances our understanding of neither Kennedy as a man and as President nor the role of character in public affairs, it will do little more than give satisfaction to Kennedy haters.

Winner of the Thomas McGann Award (Rocky Mountain Council on Latin American Studies) 


A Choice Magazine Outstanding Academic Title 





During the most idealistic years of John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress development program, Bolivia was the highest per capita recipient of U.S. foreign aid in Latin America. Nonetheless, Washington's modernization programs in early 1960s' Bolivia ended up on a collision course with important sectors of the country’s civil society, including radical workers, rebellious students, and a plethora of rightwing and leftwing political parties. In From Development to Dictatorship, Thomas C. Field Jr. reconstructs the untold story of USAID’s first years in Bolivia, including the country’s 1964 military coup d’état.
Field draws heavily on local sources to demonstrate that Bolivia’s turn toward anticommunist, development-oriented dictatorship was the logical and practical culmination of the military-led modernization paradigm that provided the liberal underpinnings of Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress. In the process, he explores several underappreciated aspects of Cold War liberal internationalism: the tendency of "development" to encourage authoritarian solutions to political unrest, the connection between modernization theories and the rise of Third World armed forces, and the intimacy between USAID and CIA covert operations. Challenging the conventional dichotomy between ideology and strategy in international politics, From Development to Dictatorship engages with a growing literature on development as a key rubric for understanding the interconnected processes of decolonization and the Cold War.





	Introduction: Ideology as Strategy

	1. Modernization's Heavy Hand: The Triangular Plan for Bolivia 

	2. Development as Anticommunism: The Targeting of Bolivian Labor 

	3. "Bitter Medicine": Military Civic Action and the Battle of Irupata 

	4. Development’s Detractors: Miners, Housewives, and the Hostage Crisis at Siglo XX 

	5. Seeds of Revolt: The Making of an Antiauthoritarian Front 

	6. Revolutionary Bolivia Puts On a Uniform: The 1964 Bolivian Coup d’État 

	Conclusion: Development and Its Discontents






From Development to Dictatorship



	"Field provides an authoritative and multisided account of the 1964 coup that deposed Paz Estenssoro and brought General René Barrientos to power; this is one of the book's principal contributions. Field's research is impressive and extensive. He consulted archival material from Bolivia, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic. Especially illuminating is a collection of papers from Paz Estenssoro's second presidency (1960–64) that only recently became available to...more scholars. From Development to Dictatorship is meticulous and engaging—a difficult balance to achieve. Field opens his preface with a 1963 visit to Bolivia by the gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thomas. The famous journalist found the country's politics Byzantine and eccentric. Field unravels that complexity with care and clarity, and his book is a substantial contribution to our understanding of the Bolivian revolution's final years and and its eventual replacement by military dictatorship."—Robert L. Smale, Labor Studies in Working-Class History of the Americas





From Development to Dictatorship



	"Based on multiarchival research and interviews with key policymakers and Bolivian labor leaders, Field's book provides an important critical perspective on the Alliance for Progress, a large-scale aid program whose underlying goal was to prevent the growth of worker-peasant socialism. From Development to Dictatorship is an outstanding addition to the literature on U.S. foreign policy in Latin America and the Cold War. Sensitive to the Bolivian perspective, Field provides sharp insights on the political imperatives underlying foreign aid programs and their link to the growth of state repression."—Jeremy Kuzmarov, Journal of Cold War Studies





From Development to Dictatorship



	"Field's lucid and scholarly account makes a significant contribution to the literature on this still rather underresearched period in Bolivia's recent political history, helping us to understand the strength of anti-U.S. sentiment, not just on the left but within much of Bolivian society."—John Crabtree, Perspectives on Politics





From Development to Dictatorship



	"Field emphasizes that it was Washington's relentless promotion of modernization schemes by any means necessary that drove Bolivia to the brink of civil war. This superb study serves as a model for future explorations of the Alliance for Progress in Latin America."—Stephen M. Streeter, Journal of American History (June 2015)




From Development to Dictatorship



	"This is international history at its best with insight that has implications well beyond the immediate country. Highly recommended."—J. P. Dunn, Choice Magazine, February 2015





From Development to Dictatorship



	"This is very well written with primary sources, not classic leftist cliché, but with declassified documents, USAID reports, and US government reports.  Thomas Field paints the portrait of a Bolivian government genuflecting before foreign imposition. I want to congratulate him for this study. It's like reading a novel, which is why I was able to read it so quickly. It takes you in quickly."—Bolivian Vice President Álvaro García Linera, Discurso Presidencial




From Development to Dictatorship



	"Thomas Field has written a fascinating, original, and impeccably documented book with marked narrative suspense."—Former Bolivian President Carlos Mesa




From Development to Dictatorship



	"Field shows how U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funding was employed to arm peasant militias against militant miners, all in the name of development. Field's book is well-researched and his work benefits from a deep engagement with Bolivia."—Andrew J. Kirkendall, H-Diplo Essay (No. 119, Nov. 14, 2014)





From Development to Dictatorship



	"Thomas Field's new book on the Alliance for Progress in Bolivia demonstrates just how comfortable America's Cold War foreign policy establishment was with dictatorship as its preferred method of rule in Latin America. Dictatorship and development became the twin pillars of the Alliance for Progress, Field's important book demonstrates. These sorts of historical narratives are necessary for modern readers to understand the roots of American foreign policy problems today."—Erik Loomis, author of Out of Sight: The Long and Disturbing Story of Corporations Outsourcing Catastrophe, on the Lawyers, Guns & Money blog 




From Development to Dictatorship



	"A tremendous contribution to the historiography."—Philip E. Muehlenbeck, H-Diplo Roundtable Reviews
 




From Development to Dictatorship



	"A devastating (and accurate, I would conclude) analysis of U.S./Paz Estenssoro top-down, militaristic-authoritarian development policy. This book is extremely well-researched (the use of interviews and international archives in particular), well-argued, and well-written. Students of Latin American history, development studies, and U.S. foreign relations will benefit from reading this book."—James F. Siekmeier, author of The Bolivian Revolution and the United States, 1952 to the Present, H-Diplo Roundtable Reviews
 

 




From Development to Dictatorship



	"Field's extensive multi-archival research allows him to provide a highly detailed account of Bolivia's military rebellion and the government's overthrow in 1964 and incorporate the perspectives of various actors into his analysis. He persuasively argues that, in Bolivia, US implementation of the Alliance for Progress was contingent on an 'approach that was authoritarian from the beginning' and can best be characterized as 'arrogant interventionism, backed up cynically by the language of...more development and modernization.' Field's comprehensive use of archival material has enabled him to produce a compelling case study of the Alliance for Progress that provides new insights into the causal link between development and authoritarianism. His nuanced analysis has resulted in insightful conclusions that reveal the important intersection of ideology and strategy within Cold War international relations."—Mark Seddon, International History Review​




From Development to Dictatorship



	"A splendid piece of scholarship. Extensively and inventively researched, engagingly narrated, and consistently thought-provoking, this is an example of international history at its best . . . gripping in a manner that is rarely found in academic studies . . . a highly impressive achievement."—Thomas Tunstall Allcock, H-Diplo Roundtable Reviews​




From Development to Dictatorship



	"A compelling local portrait of the violence that anticommunist development brought on the Bolivian left, the fracturing of the country's nationalist and revolutionary parties under the pressures of U.S. intervention, and the forms of political mobilization that the Bolivian state fought and cultivated in the Andean mines and villages."—Amy C. Offner, H-Diplo Roundtable Reviews
 




From Development to Dictatorship



	"From Development to Dictatorship is impressively researched and clearly written and makes significant contributions to the history of Bolivia and U.S. foreign relations in the Kennedy era. Thomas C. Field Jr.'s detailed coverage of this period of Bolivian-U.S. relations sheds light on the direction the Bolivian military took; the role of developmental ideology in Bolivia's drift toward militarism; the influence of the United States in shaping Bolivia's internal political processes; and...more the ways that the developmental goals of the Alliance for Progress were intimately connected to the anticommunist, militarist, and authoritarian themes of Kennedy/Johnson policies. This is a very strong addition to the literature and our understanding of why Bolivia's revolution ended as it did."—Kenneth D. Lehman, Squires Professor of History, Hampden-Sydney College, author of Bolivia and the United States: A Limited Partnership




From Development to Dictatorship



	"In From Development to Dictatorship, Thomas C. Field Jr. probes intriguing and important questions about the Alliance for Progress. Field's most impressive archival research in the United States, Bolivia, Great Britain, and France yields magnificent results by providing an exceptionally clear understanding of the actual goals and workings of the Alliance."—Mark Gilderhus, LBJ Chair of History, retired, Texas Christian University, author of The Second Century: U.S.-Latin American Relations since 1889




From Development to Dictatorship



	"From Development to Dictatorship will have an influence on more than our understanding of the land that beguiled Che Guevara. The product of remarkable interviews and of deft multi-archive international history, his intricate reconstruction of the Bolivian revolutionary scene in the early 1960s sets a high standard for reaching conclusions about the effect of U.S.-led development in any country at any time. Whether you believe that the 'Best and the Brightest' championed...more development in the 'Third World' as an act of enlightened self-interest or because of naked imperialism, this book absorbs your attention and makes you reconsider one of the defining impulses of the Kennedy era."— Timothy Naftali, coauthor of "One Hell of a Gamble"




From Development to Dictatorship



	"In From Development to Dictatorship, Thomas C. Field Jr. offers a new and compelling interpretation of John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, focusing on the case of Bolivia. His evidence is impressive and his analysis rigorous. This is a thought-provoking book."—Piero Gleijeses, The Johns Hopkins University (SAIS), author of Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959–1976




From Development to Dictatorship



	"This outstanding book serves as a model for international history. Thomas C. Field Jr. displays a remarkable knowledge of Bolivian history and culture. He further demonstrates that bilateral relations are complex and that generalizations about inter-American relations are often undermined when scholars conduct case studies that are thoroughly grounded in archival sources in both the United States and individual Latin American countries."—Stephen G. Rabe, Ashbel Smith Chair of History, University of Texas at Dallas, author of The Killing Zone: The United States Wages Cold War in Latin America​

Mr. Kennedy has been serving as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Hilton Worldwide, Inc. since 2008.  In this capacity, he has been instrumental in driving the transformation of Hilton including balance sheet restructuring and deleveraging initiatives, financial planning and forecasting process improvements, and companywide efficiency programs, all leading to significant shareholder value creation.  From 2003 through 2007, Mr. Kennedy served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for the Vanguard Car Rental Group (National Car Rental and Alamo Rent-A-Car brands).  He was part of the senior leadership team which engineered the transformation and ultimate sale of Vanguard's European business to Eurazeo and the sale of the North American business to Enterprise Rent-a-Car.  At Hilton and Vanguard, Mr. Kennedy also helped lead headquarter relocation initiatives.  From 1992 through 2003, Mr. Kennedy worked for Northwest Airlines, Inc. in numerous roles with increasing management responsibility, primarily in the company's financial areas, including serving two years as the financial controller for Asia based in Tokyo, Japan.  Mr. Kennedy was Senior Vice President and Controller when he left Northwest for Vanguard in 2003.  He holds a BA degree in Economics, summa cum laude, from Tulane University and an MBA from Harvard University.
"Tom has demonstrated excellent leadership skills in two previous CFO assignments with multi-national, travel industry companies," said Hertz Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark P. Frissora.  "His experience will be invaluable at Hertz as we continue to integrate Dollar Thrifty and evaluate strategic options and future capital deployment strategies going forward," Frissora added.
