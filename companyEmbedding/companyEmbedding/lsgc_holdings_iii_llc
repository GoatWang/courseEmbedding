deemed incorporated by reference in all other items, as applicable. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning ascribed to such term in the Schedule 13D, as amended. 
 


Item 2.
Identity and Background  Item 2 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and superseded, as the case may be,
as follows:  (e) As disclosed in the Issuers Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 3, 2014, the Issuer is, together with
several of its affiliates and equity holders and certain other persons, including PCA, a defendant in securities litigation (the Geveran Case) brought by Geveran Investments Limited (Geveran), and
on August 28, 2014, an Order Granting Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Under its First Cause of Action for Violation of the Florida Securities and Investment Protection Act (the August 28
Order) was granted by the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, Florida (the Circuit Court). The August 28 Order was entered on November 30, 2015, awarding
Geveran, jointly and severally against each of the defendants, $25,000,000 as recessionary damages, prejudgment interest in the amount of $6,752,280, reasonable attorneys fees in the amount of $4,456,787.40 and taxable costs in the amount of
$469,061.93, for a total recovery of approximately $36,678,129.33.  The Issuer stated in its Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 3, 2014, that
it believes that the Circuit Courts partial summary judgment ruling in favor of Geveran was erroneous and that it intends to appeal it to the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals. The Circuit Court has issued a temporary stay of the
execution of the judgment to allow the defendants sufficient time to perfect an appeal seeking review of the August 28 Order. On December 7, 2015, the Issuer posted an appeal bond in support of its appeal of the August 28 Order. 




Item 3.
Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration  Item 3 of Schedule 13D is supplemented as
follows:  The disclosure in Item 4 below is incorporated by reference herein. 
 


Item 4.
Purpose of Transaction  Item 4 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and superseded, as the case may be,
as follows:  Series K Securities Issuance  On
December 7, 2015, as contemplated by the previously disclosed Preferred Stock Subscription and Support Agreement (the Subscription Agreement) among Lighting Science Group Corporation (the
Issuer), LSGC Holdings III and PPIV, and to facilitate support for the Appeal Bond (as defined below), the Issuer issued to PPIV 20,106.03 units of the Issuers securities (the Series K
Securities), with each unit consisting of (a) one share of the Issuers Series K Preferred Stock (the Series K Preferred Stock) and (b) a warrant to purchase 735 shares of common stock of the
Issuer in consideration of PPIV providing assistance to the Issuer with securing an appeal bond in the amount of up to $20,106,028.29 (the Appeal Bond) on the terms set forth in a General Indemnity Agreement and related
side letter entered into by and among the Issuer, PPIV and the issuer of the Appeal Bond (the Appeal Bond Agreements). In total, the Issuer issued 20,106.03 shares of Series K Preferred Stock and a warrant to purchase
14,777,932 shares of the Issuers common stock (the Appeal Bond Warrant) to PPIV.  The Series K Preferred Stock has the
designations, preferences, voting rights and other special rights set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Series K Preferred Stock (the Series K COD), which was filed as Exhibit 4.2 to the Issuers Form 8-K
filed with the SEC on September 17, 2015. The Series K Preferred Stock is senior to the Issuers Series H Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series H Preferred Stock), the Issuers Series I
Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series I Preferred Stock), the Series J Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series J Preferred Stock) and the Issuers common stock with respect to the payment of
dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Issuer. Depending on whether the Appeal Bond has been drawn or fully released, the Series K COD requires the Issuer to redeem the outstanding shares of Series K
Preferred Stock in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Issuer or an earlier change of control or junior security redemption, which includes events triggering a redemption of the outstanding shares of Series H
Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock or Series J Preferred Stock.  As disclosed in Item 2(e) and in the Issuers Current Report on Form 8-K
filed with the SEC on September 3, 2014, the Issuer is, together with several of its affiliates and equity holders and certain other persons, including PCA, a defendant in the Geveran Case. On November 30, 2015, the August 28 Order
was entered. The Issuer posted the Appeal Bond in support of its appeal of the August 28 Order upon entry thereof and, pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, PPIV assisted the Issuer in securing the Appeal Bond. 
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Issuer also agreed to commence a rights offering of the Series K Securities pursuant to which it will offer all
holders of common stock and securities convertible into common stock (other than derivative securities issued pursuant to the Issuers equity-based compensation plan and employee stock purchase plan) the right to purchase a pro rata share
of a like number of Series K Securities as the number issued to PPIV (the Rights Offering). The Series K Securities offered pursuant to the Rights Offering will be issued in exchange for a commitment from any exercising
holder to fund an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Series K Securities to be acquired by such holder by (ii) $1,000, with such commitment to be payable when, as and if the Appeal Bond is drawn upon. If
an exercising holder fails to fund its obligations in accordance with the terms of the Series K COD, PPIV will remain obligated to fund the applicable amount of the Appeal Bond. The Issuer agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to file and have
declared effective a registration statement relating to the Rights Offering as soon as reasonably practicable after the entry of the August 28 Order. 


Pursuant to the Series K COD, in the event of a claim on the Appeal Bond resulting in a payment by PPIV to the
issuer of the Appeal Bond, such as a loss on appeal and collection of the bond amount from PPIV pursuant to the Appeal Bond Agreements, the outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock will be retained by the holders who have satisfied their
obligations to fund their portion of the Appeal Bond in accordance with the terms of the Series K COD (the Funding Series K Holders). The Series K COD provides that, following the release or satisfaction in full of the
commitments under the Appeal Bond, the Issuer will cancel for no additional consideration all of the shares of Series K Preferred Stock issued to PPIV and the Funding Series K Holders except a number of shares equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Series K Preferred Stock held by such holder and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount of payments made by such holder with respect to funding the Appeal Bond and the denominator of which is the
aggregate liquidation value (calculated by multiplying the number of shares held by such holder by $1,000) of such shares of Series K Preferred Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share. In the event that the Issuer wins the appeal of the
August 28 Order, upon the expiration or termination of the Appeal Bond, all shares of Series K Preferred Stock will be cancelled for no consideration. 
The Appeal Bond Warrant will be exercisable beginning on the date that the Appeal Bond has been fully drawn or all commitments thereunder have been released
and ending on the earlier of: (i) December 31, 2025, (ii) the date on which the Issuer consummates a Qualified Public Offering (as defined in the Appeal Bond Warrant), or (iii) the date of any Change of Control (as defined in the
Appeal Bond Warrant). The Appeal Bond Warrant will be exercisable at an exercise price of $0.12 per share, subject to adjustments as provided in the Appeal Bond Warrant. PPIV and any Funding Series K Holders will retain the Appeal Bond Warrant(s)
issued to such holders as consideration for their agreement to support the Appeal Bond regardless of whether such holders are required to make payments with respect to funding the Appeal Bond. 
The Appeal Bond Warrant does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Appeal Bond Warrant, which is
filed as Exhibit 99.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.  The Reporting Persons continuously assess the Issuers business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic conditions, other developments and additional investment opportunities. Depending on such assessments, the Reporting Persons and/or their affiliates may acquire additional securities
of the Issuer, including but not limited to common stock, existing preferred securities or new securities of the Issuer or may determine to purchase, sell or otherwise dispose of all or some of the Issuers securities in the open market, as
applicable, in privately negotiated transactions, in transactions directly with the Issuer or otherwise. Such actions will depend upon a variety of factors, including, without limitation, current and anticipated future trading prices, the financial
condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer, alternative investment opportunities, general economic, financial market and industry conditions and other factors that the Reporting Persons and/or their affiliates may deem material to
its investment decision. Also, the Reporting Persons and/or their affiliates have had and will continue to have discussions with management regarding the operations of the Issuer and matters of mutual interest, which could include the items in
subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.  Except as set forth herein and/or in previous amendments to this Schedule
13D, as the case may be, the Reporting Persons do not have present plans or proposals at this time that relate to or would result in any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D. 
 


Item 5.
Interest in Securities of the Issuer  Item 5 of this Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in
its entirety as follows:  (a) (b) Items 7 through 11 and 13 of each of the cover pages of this amended Schedule 13D are incorporated herein by
reference. Such information is based on 211,756,727 shares of common stock outstanding as of November 10, 2015, according to the Issuers Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 13, 2015. 
(c) The information in Item 4 is incorporated herein by reference. 
In addition, on November 19, 2015, certain shares of restricted common stock of the Issuer previously granted by the Issuers Board of Directors
(the Board) directly to Pegasus Capital Advisors IV, L.P. (Pegasus Advisors IV) 



as director fees in respect of the service of Craig Cogut and Richard H. Davis, Jr. on the Issuers Board were cancelled in exchange for options to purchase the Issuers common stock
that were granted directly to Pegasus Advisors IV. In exchange for options to purchase 451,238 shares of common stock of the Issuer, 200,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Issuer granted in respect of Mr. Coguts Board service
were cancelled, and in exchange for options to purchase 541,485 shares of common stock of the Issuer, 240,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Issuer granted in respect of Mr. Davis Board service were cancelled. The options to
purchase common stock of the Issuer will be exercisable on January 1, 2016 at an exercise price of $0.13 per share, and expire on November 19, 2025. 
Because Mr. Cogut and Mr. Davis, each employees and/or partners, as the case may be, of Pegasus Advisors IV, serve on the Issuers Board as
representatives of Pegasus Advisors IV and its affiliates, each of Mr. Cogut and Mr. Davis do not have a right to any of the Issuers securities issued as director fees and Pegasus Advisors IV is entitled to receive all director fees
payable by the Issuer in respect of Mr. Coguts and Mr. Davis Board positions. All securities issued as director fees for Mr. Coguts and Mr. Davis Board service were accordingly issued directly to Pegasus
Advisors IV. Pegasus Capital Advisors IV GP, L.L.C. (Pegasus Advisors IV GP) is the general partner of Pegasus Advisors IV and Mr. Cogut is the sole owner and managing member of Pegasus Advisors IV GP. 
Except as set forth herein and/or in our previously filed amendments to Schedule 13D, as the case may be, there have been no other transactions in the class
of securities reported on that were effected within the past 60 days.  (d) The disclosure regarding the relationship between the Reporting Persons in
Item 2(f) of Amendment No. 39 to this Schedule 13D is incorporated by reference herein.  (e) N/A 
 


Item 6.
Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer 
Item 6 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and superseded, as the case may be, as follows: 
The disclosure in Item 4 is incorporated by reference herein. 
The Appeal Bond Warrant is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Amendment No. 42 to Schedule 13D and is incorporated by reference herein.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. See Part I "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with those statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward- looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section entitled "Risk Factors."  Overview  We are an innovator and global provider of light emitting diode ("LED") lighting technology. We design, develop and market advanced, environmentally sustainable and differentiated illumination solutions that exclusively use LEDs as their light source. Our product portfolio includes LED-based retrofit lamps (replacement bulbs) used in existing light fixtures as well as purpose-built LED-based luminaires (light fixtures). Our lamps and luminaires are used for many common indoor and outdoor residential, commercial, industrial and public infrastructure lighting applications and include LED lighting technology whose color is tuned to achieve specific biological effects. We believe our proprietary technology, unique designs and key relationships throughout the LED lighting supply chain position us favorably to capitalize on the expanding acceptance of LEDs as a lighting source.  Our strategic plan for the next three fiscal years consists of building our retail business through our Joint Venture (as described in Recent Events below), as well as creating strong biologically correct lighting brands in the consumer, residential, commercial and industrial markets. We believe that developing innovative and differentiated brands will deliver strong financial returns and a more loyal user base that is less price sensitive. We intend to continue to implement a nimble and agile "go-to-market" business model and manufacturing and product development system to streamline the processes used to introduce new products. We also intend to continue focusing on developing breakthrough innovation and on becoming a market maker in targeted value-added, high-margin segments within the lighting market. Finally, we plan to reduce our cost structure, preserve cash flow and strengthen liquidity to enhance our financial position.  Over the past few years, we have focused on expanding and optimizing our global supply chain to meet forecasted demand for our products while addressing the inefficiencies that have compressed our gross profit and overall financial performance in prior periods such as costs incurred to expedite the production or delivery of component parts. We anticipate long-term gross profit improvement as we continue to execute on our initiatives. We completed one of our most critical initiatives in 2014 with the transition of the manufacturing of our high volume lamps from Mexico and Satellite Beach to our contract manufacturing partners in Asia, from which we source the majority of our components. In 2015, we opened a new distribution center in Seattle, Washington in order to reduce the transit time for products from Asia and to provide us with an additional port through which we can import goods. In 2016, we closed our distribution center in Dallas, Texas, consolidating our warehouse operations into our Seattle, Washington warehouse. We believe that consolidating our distribution facilities will help to better maintain the continuity of our supply chain, improve our supply-to-cash cycle time and lower our distribution costs.  Recent Events  On March 20, 2017, we formed LSG MLS JV Holdings, Inc. ("LSG JV Holdings") as a subsidiary and entered into an operating agreement (the "Operating Agreement") with MLS Co., Ltd. ("MLS") relating to the formation of Global Value Lighting, LLC ("GVL"). GVL was formed as a joint venture between us and MLS for the purpose of carrying out the manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of private label LED lighting products and services to retail and commercial customers in North America and South America (the "Joint Venture"). The Joint Venture is an integral part of our long-term strategy. We believe the Joint Venture will allow GVL to focus on the retail LED business, including the private label LED business, which to date has represented a significant portion of our revenues, while allowing us to focus on our technology business featuring product lines such as its proprietary HealthE(TM), VividGro(R), and FreeLED(TM), which will be operated independently from GVL. The Joint Venture remains subject to certain closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Joint Venture, we (through LSG JV Holdings) will make an initial capital contribution of $5.1 million in cash to GVL, and MLS will make an initial capital contribution of $4.9 million in cash to GVL. Upon the determination of the board of managers of GVL, each of LSG JV Holdings and MLS will be required to make additional capital contributions of up to $7.65 million and $7.35 million in the aggregate, respectively, during the first 12 months following the closing date. LSG JV Holdings will own 51% of the membership interests of GVL and MLS will own 49% of the membership interests of GVL.  On January 27, 2017 and February 3, 2017, we issued 3,000 and 7,000 units of our securities ("Series J Securities"), respectively, to LSGC Holdings III LLC ("Holdings III"), an affiliate of Pegasus Capital Advisors, L.P. ("Pegasus Capital"), for aggregate gross proceeds of $10.0 million, with each Series J Security consisting of (a) one share of our Series J Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series J Preferred Stock") and (b) a warrant to purchase 2,650 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), at an exercise price of $0.001 per share of Common Stock.  LED Lighting Industry Trends  There are a number of industry factors that affect our business and results of operations including, among others:   Rate and extent of adoption of LED lighting products. Our potential for growth will be driven by the rate and extent of adoption of LED lighting within the general illumination market and our ability to affect this rate of adoption through the offering of competitive lighting solutions. Although LED lighting is relatively new, its adoption has grown in recent years. Innovations and advancements in LED lighting technology that improve product performance and reduce product cost continue to enhance the value proposition of LED lighting for general illumination and expand its potential commercial applications.   External legislation and subsidy programs concerning energy efficiency. The United States and many countries in the European Union and elsewhere have already instituted, or have announced plans to institute, government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency in lighting. These actions include in certain cases banning the sale after specified dates of certain forms of incandescent lighting, which is advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as LEDs. In addition, the growing demand for electricity is increasingly driving utilities and governmental agencies to provide financial incentives such as rebates for energy efficient lighting technologies in an effort to mitigate the need for investments in new electrical generation capacity. While this trend is generally positive for us, from time to time there have been political efforts in the United States to change or limit the effectiveness of these regulations.   Intellectual property. LED market participants rely on patented and non-patented proprietary information relating to product development, manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business. Protection and licensing of intellectual property is critical. Therefore, LED lighting industry participants often take steps such as additional patent applications, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements as well as other security measures. To enforce or protect intellectual property rights, market participants commonly commence or threaten litigation.   Intense and constantly evolving competitive environment. Competition in the LED lighting market is intense. Many companies have made significant investments in LED lighting development and production equipment. Traditional lighting companies and new entrants are investing in LED based lighting products as LED adoption has gained momentum. Product pricing pressures are significant and market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share, enhance sales of their previously manufactured products and open new applications to LED based lighting solutions. To remain competitive, market participants must continuously increase product performance and reduce costs.  Financial Results The following table sets forth our revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenue $ 52,696,719 $ 79,749,772 $ 91,284,860 Cost of goods sold 46,417,908 68,548,508 87,702,728 Gross profit $ 6,278,811 $ 11,201,264 $ 3,582,132 GAAP gross profit percentage 11.9 % 14.0 % 3.9 %  Our revenue is primarily derived from sales of our LED-based retrofit lamps and luminaires. Our revenue decreased by $27.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in revenue was due to a decrease in sales to The Home Depot, Inc. ("The Home Depot") of $25.5 million and a decrease in sales to other commercial customers of $1.6 million. The Home Depot performed a periodic product line review in 2015 relating to its entire private label LED lighting product offering and, as a result, The Home Depot elected to purchase certain products previously supplied by us directly from overseas suppliers. Such products represented a significant percentage of our sales to The Home Depot for the three years prior to the line review and the loss of this business was the primary reason for the decline in sales to The Home Depot for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in sales to other commercial customers for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the loss of two distribution customers, the sales of excess inventory at reduced prices and increased competition in the industry generally. Our revenue decreased $11.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease in revenue was due to a $10.5 million decrease in sales to commercial customers and a $1.0 million decrease in sales to The Home Depot.  We continue to pursue new relationships with retailers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") to help increase and diversify our sales.  Our gross profit is principally driven by the mix and quantity of products we sell. Our financial results are dependent upon the operating costs associated with our supply chain, including materials, labor and freight, and the level of our selling, distribution and administrative, research and development and other operating expenses. We continuously seek to improve our existing products and to bring new products to market. As a result, many of our products have short life cycles and, therefore, product life cycle planning is critical. At times we may purchase excess components and other materials used in the manufacture and assembly of our products or we may manufacture finished products in excess of demand. In addition, components, materials and products may become obsolete earlier than expected. These circumstances may require us to record inventory reserves and provisions for expected losses on non-cancellable purchase commitments. When these circumstances are present, we may also incur additional expense as we adjust our supply chain and product life cycle planning.  As a result of charges for inventory reserves, our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 declined as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, our gross profit improved due to changes in the mix of products sold (more sales from higher margin inventory) and lower charges for inventory reserves and for warranty expenses, as well as increased use of contract manufacturing in Asia resulting in lower costs of production.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  Although our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), we believe the following non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to the assessment of our operating performance and trends. As part of our on-going review of financial information related to our business, our management regularly uses non-GAAP measures, particularly non-GAAP adjusted operating expense as a percentage of revenue. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measures and are intended to supplement our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We define non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses as total operating expenses less non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation, restructuring expenses and depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $1.9 million (or 8.0%) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, while revenue decreased 33.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $11.5 million (or 32.3%) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, while revenue decreased 12.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses represented 42.1% and 30.2% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the decrease in non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses was due to (i) a reduction in stock compensation expense, which resulted from the termination of employees during 2016 that had non-vested stock option grants and the previously recognized stock compensation expense reversed for those non-vested stock option grants, and(ii) and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense, which was driven by savings resulting from not replacing property and equipment that was fully depreciated. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the decrease in non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to significant cost cutting measures taken in 2014 with the resulting cost savings realized in 2015.   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenue $ 52,696,719 $ 79,749,772 $ 91,284,860 Total operating expense 22,785,227 30,509,787 46,495,568 Less: Issuance of resricted stock and stock options for directors compensation 118,125 358,671 669,639 Non-cash stock option and restricted stock compensation expense (305,288 ) 2,171,133 3,390,005 Restructuring expense - 1,883,326 3,467,835 Depreciation and amortization 781,864 1,973,959 3,355,865 Total operating expenses, excluding stock based compensation, restructuring and depreciation and amortization $ 22,190,526 $ 24,122,698 $ 35,612,224 GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue 43.2 % 38.3 % 50.9 % Non-GAAP adjusted operating expense as a percentage of revenue 42.1 % 30.2 % 39.0 %  Over the past several years, we adapted our supply chain and logistics processes to improve our ability to more efficiently meet customer needs while continuing to focus on developing innovative products. During this period, we improved our forecasting and finished goods inventory management, transitioned our manufacturing processes to lower cost contract manufacturers in Asia and enhanced our new product innovation process. We believe these changes drove additional improvements in our management and manufacturing infrastructure and expanded our ability to source components and manufacture our products internationally. We believe these improvements will allow us to focus more on innovative, science based and creative engineering talent, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. In addition to developing products that target mainstream retail and commercial lighting, we are seeking to expand our product offerings to compete across multiple industry verticals.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained and our operating environment changes. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and consist of finished lighting products. Inventories are valued on a first-in, first out basis.  Significant changes in our strategic plan, including changes in product mix, product demand, slow product adoption, rapid technological changes and new product introductions and enhancements could result in excess or obsolete inventory. We evaluate inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis to specifically identify obsolete, slow-moving or non-salable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The write-down of excess and obsolete inventory based on this evaluation creates a new cost basis and is included in cost of goods sold.  On a quarterly basis, we consider the need to record a lower of cost or market adjustment for our raw materials and finished goods inventory. The market value of finished goods is determined based upon current sales transactions, less the cost of disposal of the respective finished goods.  Revenue Recognition  Product sales are generally recorded when our products are shipped and title passes to customers. Where sales of product are subject to certain customer acceptance terms, revenue from such sales are recognized once these terms have been met.  Income Taxes  We employ the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are reversed.  We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount which, we estimate, is more likely than not to be realized. Our ability to realize our deferred tax assets is generally dependent on the generation of taxable income during the future periods in which the temporary differences are deductible and the net operating losses can be offset against taxable income. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, the resulting adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase net earnings in the period such a determination was made.  Going Concern  We evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that may raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that our financial statements are issued or available to be issued. Conditions or events include expected future results of operations, liquidity needs, financing agreements and capital needs.  Financial Operations Overview  Revenue  Our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of our LED-based retrofit lamps and luminaires for indoor and outdoor general illumination applications in the residential, commercial, industrial and public infrastructure markets. Our revenue is dependent on the continuing adoption of LED lighting in our target markets which, in turn, are subject to improvements in LED lighting performance as well as reductions in LED lighting cost. We expect our selling prices to continue to decline over time and believe that these declines will be offset by increases in sales volume, subject to our ability to access end users of LED lighting products. We depend heavily on the strength of our relationships with certain retail customers, primarily The Home Depot, and OEM customers, which provide us with access to residential and commercial end users of LED lighting products. We may experience significant inflections in growth as we enter into relationships with partners such as these and we will seek to develop similar relationships with new customers. Conversely, any deterioration in our relationships with these customers or in their activities in LED lighting could negatively impact our revenue.  The Home Depot accounted for 89%, 91% and 80% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As discussed above, revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was adversely affected by the loss of certain business from The Home Depot, as well as the loss of two distribution customers. Due to these recent challenges, the success of our direct sales efforts, including our ability to effectively grow and manage the roster of distributors and independent sales agents that sell our products is increasingly critical to our business.  Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit  Cost of goods sold includes the cost of products purchased from our contract manufacturers as well as the cost of related inbound freight, manufacturing labor, production overhead and warranty costs. We also include provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and non-cancellable purchase commitments in our cost of goods sold. We source our manufactured products based on sales projections and customer orders.  Currently, purchased products from our contract manufacturers represent the largest portion of our cost of goods sold. On a per unit basis, these costs generally decrease as we gain purchasing scale with increases in our sales. In periods of rapidly increasing demand, however, we may incur higher costs to ensure an adequate supply of products and components and to expedite shipping by means of premium inbound freight. These costs are typically higher the more dependent we are on a limited number of suppliers for specific products and the greater the distance is between production sites and such suppliers. We have historically incurred higher costs to the extent our supply chain management and production processes resulted in larger physical inventory variances or lower yields. With our increased reliance on contract manufacturers, we believe we will see continued improvement in our gross profit due to our increased ability to manage our inventory costs. Our contract manufacturers provide improved manufacturing capacity, which we expect will reduce the lead-time requirements for most products and reduce the amount of inventory we will be required to carry in the future. In addition, our increased usage of contract manufacturers has led to a reduction in overhead and labor costs. Assuming that the pending Joint Venture with MLS closes, we believe this relationship will drive additional improvements in cost of goods sold and gross profit.  During 2016, our cost of goods sold continued to be adversely impacted by our ability to accurately forecast product demand and manage the procurement and availability of our materials. Acquisition costs generally decline on a per unit basis with an increase in throughput through better execution and higher volumes of production, as well as technological advances in the manufacturing process. Accordingly, newly introduced products typically have higher per unit costs as we gain supply chain and manufacturing process efficiencies. Our warranty costs depend both on the quality of our manufacturing processes as well as our ability to design products for greater reliability. Additionally, our ability to control excess inventory reserves depends on how accurately we match future purchases of inventory with future sales.  Our gross profit is also affected by a number of other factors, including the average selling price of our products and our ability to offset declining prices with lower production costs. Our mix of products sold and the customers to whom they are sold also impact our gross profit as certain of our products have higher levels of profitability and we may contractually price our products at lower levels for certain customers based on volume expectations, contract duration and our own cost reduction roadmap. To the extent we suffer temporary manufacturing or supply chain inefficiencies, implementation of our cost reduction roadmap may be delayed resulting in unplanned declines in gross profit for certain products until these inefficiencies are addressed.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses consist of selling, distribution and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Personnel-related expenses comprise the most significant component of these expenses. In any particular period, the timing of additional hires or layoffs could materially affect our operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue.  Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses. Selling, distribution and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, sales commissions, samples and other marketing costs for new products and customer demonstrations, fees for professional services, public company costs, travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, cost of marketing materials and other corporate communications, customer service expenses, and direct and allocated facilities and other related overhead costs. Professional services consist principally of . . .  Apr 14, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are any statements that look to future events and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future liquidity, financial performance and capital expenditures; the sufficiency of our existing cash and cash equivalents to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months; our ability to successfully identify new customers and business opportunities and retain or expand our relationship with current customers; our ability to manage uncertainty with respect to product demand, product costs and end of life-cycle planning; our ability to execute on our strategic plan and realize benefits from initiatives related to streamlining our operations, cost-cutting measures and the introduction of new products; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; our ability to maintain and enhance the quality, safety and efficacy of our products; general economic and business conditions in our markets and our ability to improve our gross profit and achieve profitable growth; and the outcome in any pending and future litigation. In addition, forward-looking statements also consist of statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as "anticipates," "believes," "could," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "might," "plans," "predicts" and similar terms and variations thereof. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q and are subject to business and economic risks. As such, our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on April 14, 2016 (the "Form 10-K") and the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason except as required by law.  Company Overview  We are an innovator and global provider of light emitting diode ("LED") lighting technology. We design, develop and market advanced, environmentally sustainable and differentiated illumination solutions that exclusively use LEDs as their light source. Our product portfolio includes LED-based retrofit lamps (replacement bulbs) used in existing light fixtures as well as purpose-built LED-based luminaires (light fixtures). Our lamps and luminaires are used for many common indoor and outdoor residential, commercial, industrial and public infrastructure lighting applications and include LED lighting technology whose color is tuned to achieve specific biological effects. We believe our proprietary technology, unique designs and key relationships throughout the LED lighting supply chain position us favorably to capitalize on the expanding acceptance of LEDs as a lighting source.  Our strategic plan for the next three fiscal years consists of creating strong biologically correct lighting brands in the consumer, residential, commercial and industrial markets. We believe that developing innovative and differentiated brands will deliver strong financial returns and a more loyal user base that is less price sensitive. We intend to continue to implement a nimble and agile "go-to-market" business model and manufacturing and product development system to streamline the processes used to introduce new products. We also intend to continue focusing on developing breakthrough innovation and on becoming a market maker in targeted value-added, high-margin segments within the lighting market. Finally, we plan to reduce our cost structure, preserve cash flow and strengthen liquidity to enhance our financial position.  Over the past few years, we have focused on expanding and optimizing our global supply chain to meet forecasted demand for our products while addressing the inefficiencies that have compressed our gross profit and overall financial performance in prior periods such as costs incurred to expedite the production or delivery of component parts. We anticipate long-term gross profit improvement as we continue to execute on our initiatives. We completed one of our most critical initiatives in 2014 with the transition of the manufacturing of our high volume lamps from Mexico and Satellite Beach to our contract manufacturing partners in Asia, from which we source the majority of our components. In 2015, we opened a new distribution center in Seattle, Washington in order to reduce the transit time for products from Asia and to provide us with an additional port through which we can import goods. A labor dispute at the Port of Los Angeles in 2015 caused work slowdowns and, as a result, affected the timing and predictability of our deliveries. We believe that our additional distribution facility will help to better maintain the continuity of our supply chain and improve our supply-to-cash cycle time.  LED Lighting Industry Trends  There are a number of industry factors that affect our business and results of operations including, among others:   Rate and extent of adoption of LED lighting products. Our potential for growth will be driven by the rate and extent of adoption of LED lighting within the general illumination market and our ability to affect this rate of adoption through the offering of competitive lighting solutions. Although LED lighting is relatively new, its adoption has grown in recent years. Innovations and advancements in LED lighting technology that improve product performance and reduce product cost continue to enhance the value proposition of LED lighting for general illumination and expand its potential commercial applications.   External legislation and subsidy programs concerning energy efficiency. The United States and many countries in the European Union and elsewhere have already instituted, or have announced plans to institute, government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency in lighting. These actions include in certain cases banning the sale after specified dates of certain forms of incandescent lighting, which is advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as LEDs. In addition, the growing demand for electricity is increasingly driving utilities and governmental agencies to provide financial incentives such as rebates for energy efficient lighting technologies in an effort to mitigate the need for investments in new electrical generation capacity. While this trend is generally positive for us, from time to time there have been political efforts in the United States to change or limit the effectiveness of these regulations.   Intellectual property. LED market participants rely on patented and non-patented proprietary information relating to product development, manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business. Protection and licensing of intellectual property is critical. Therefore, LED lighting industry participants often take steps such as additional patent applications, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements as well as other security measures. To enforce or protect intellectual property rights, market participants commonly commence or threaten litigation.   Intense and constantly evolving competitive environment. Competition in the LED lighting market is intense. Many companies have made significant investments in LED lighting development and production equipment. Traditional lighting companies and new entrants are investing in LED based lighting products as LED adoption has gained momentum. Product pricing pressures are significant and market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share, enhance sales of their previously manufactured products and open new applications to LED based lighting solutions. To remain competitive, market participants must continuously increase product performance and reduce costs.  Financial Results The following table sets forth our revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 Revenue $ 17,098,013 $ 19,371,545 Cost of goods sold 13,619,103 16,441,297 Gross profit $ 3,478,910 $ 2,930,248 GAAP gross profit percentage 20.3 % 15.1 %  Our revenue is primarily derived from sales of our LED-based retrofit lamps and luminaires. Our revenue decreased by $2.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015. This decrease in revenue was due to a decrease in sales to commercial customers of $2.0 million and a $365,000 decrease in sales to The Home Depot, Inc. ("The Home Depot").  We continue to pursue new relationships with retailers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") to help increase and diversity our sales. In addition, we have increased the roster of distributors and independent sales agents that sell our products and added experienced professionals to our direct sales force to increase the frequency and impact of our activities with key national accounts that are targets for potential adoption of LED lighting.  Our gross profit is principally driven by the mix and quantity of products we sell. Our financial results are dependent upon the operating costs associated with our supply chain, including materials, labor and freight, and the level of our selling, distribution and administrative, research and development and other operating expenses. We continuously seek to improve our existing products and to bring new products to market. As a result, many of our products have short life cycles and, therefore, product life cycle planning is critical. At times we may purchase excess components and other materials used in the manufacture and assembly of our products or we may manufacture finished products in excess of demand. In addition, components, materials and products may become obsolete earlier than expected. These circumstances may require us to record inventory reserves and provisions for expected losses on non-cancellable purchase commitments. When these circumstances are present, we may also incur additional expense as we adjust our supply chain and product life-cycle planning.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, our gross profit improved to 20.3% compared to 15.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This improvement was due to changes in the mix of products sold (more sales from higher margin inventory), as well as lower charges for inventory reserves and for warranty expenses.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  Although our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), we believe the following non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to the assessment of our operating performance and trends. As part of our on-going review of financial information related to our business, we regularly use non-GAAP measures, particularly non-GAAP adjusted gross profit and non-GAAP adjusted operating expense as a percentage of revenue, as we believe they provide meaningful insight into our business and useful information with respect to the results of our operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measures and are intended to supplement our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The adjusted presentation below is used by management to measure our business performance and we believe it provides useful information regarding the trend in gross profit percentage based on revenue from sales of our products to customers.  We define non-GAAP adjusted cost of goods sold as costs of goods sold less provisions for inventory write-offs. Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit was 20.3% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to 16.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  We define non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses as total operating expenses less non-cash expenses for stock based compensation, restructuring expenses and depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 increased 4.5% while revenue decreased 11.7% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015. Non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses represented 32.8% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to 27.7% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2015.   Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 2015 Revenue $ 17,098,013 $ 19,371,545 Cost of goods sold 13,619,103 16,441,297 Deduct: Provisions for inventory write-offs - 271,452 Adjusted cost of goods sold 13,619,103 16,169,845 Adjusted gross profit $ 3,478,910 $ 3,201,700 Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit percentage 20.3 % 16.5 % Total operating expense $ 6,378,136 $ 6,866,670 Less: Issuance of restricted stock and stock options for directors compensation 11,903 11,101 Non-cash stock option and restricted stock compensation expense 544,706 905,396 Restructuring expense - 83,704 Depreciation and amortization 221,073 506,072 Total operating expenses, excluding stock based compensation, restructuring and depreciation and amortization $ 5,600,454 $ 5,360,397 GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 37.3 % 35.4 % Non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 32.8 % 27.7 %  During 2014 and 2013, we adapted our supply chain and logistics processes to improve our ability to provide more efficient service to our customers and focus our efforts on developing innovative products. We continued to make improvements in our forecasting and finished goods inventory management, continued the transition of our manufacturing processes to lower cost contract manufacturers in Asia and continued to enhance our new product innovation process.  We believe that the changes we initiated improved our management and manufacturing infrastructure, expanded our ability to source components and manufacture our products internationally and positioned us for organic growth. We believe these improvements will position us to capitalize on the innovative, science based and creative engineering talent at our Florida research and development facility, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. In addition to developing products targeted at mainstream retail and commercial lighting, we are seeking to expand our product offerings to compete across multiple industry verticals.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained and our operating environment changes. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.  We believe that our critical accounting policies relate to our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 contains a discussion of these critical accounting policies. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2015. See also Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as set forth herein.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015  The following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:   Three Months Ended March 31, Variance Percentage of Revenue 2016 2015 $ % 2016 2015 Revenue $ 17,098,013 $ 19,371,545 (2,273,532 ) -11.7 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 13,619,103 16,441,297 (2,822,194 ) -17.2 % 79.7 % 84.9 % Selling, distribution and administrative 5,076,064 5,095,581 (19,517 ) * 29.7 % 26.3 % Research and development 1,080,999 1,181,313 (100,314 ) * 6.3 % 6.1 % Restructuring expense - 83,704 (83,704 ) * 0.0 % 0.4 % Depreciation and amortization 221,073 506,072 (284,999 ) -56.3 % 1.3 % 2.6 % Interest expense, including related party (1,750,746 ) (1,600,660 ) (150,086 ) * -10.2 % -8.3 % Increase in fair value of liabilities under derivative contracts (78,734 ) (8,100,772 ) 8,022,038 -99.0 % -0.5 % -41.8 % Other expense, net 11,018 36,764 (25,746 ) * 0.1 % 0.2 % Income tax expense 2,560 - 2,560 * 0.0 % 0.0 % Net income (loss) $ (4,720,248 ) $ (13,601,090 ) 8,880,842 -65.3 % -27.6 % -70.2 %  * Variance is not meaningful  Revenue  Revenue decreased $2.3 million, or 11.7%, to $17.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from $19.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in revenue was primarily a result of a $365,000 decrease in sales to The Home Depot and a $2.0 million decrease in sales to commercial customers during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to sales during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  Cost of Goods Sold  Cost of goods sold decreased $2.8 million, or 17.2%, to $13.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from $16.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the reduction in revenue, as well as lower levels of inventory reserves and warranty provisions taken in the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2015. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 79.7% (or a gross profit percentage of 20.3%) as compared to 84.9% (or a gross profit percentage of 15.1%) for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $285,000, or 56.3%, to $221,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from $506,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of our continued use of property and equipment, which we have elected not to replace as part of our cost cutting initiative.  Increase in Fair Value of Liabilities under Derivative Contracts  The change in the fair value of liabilities under derivative contracts is driven by changes in the trading price of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock") and changes in risk-free interest rates. The increase in fair value of liabilities under derivative contracts for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $79,000, compared to an increase of $8.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, representing a decline of 99.0%, or $8.0 million. The change was due to the relatively small change in the price of our Common Stock between the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2015.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We have experienced significant historical net losses as well as negative cash flows from operations, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $832.1 million and stockholders' deficit of $558.7 million as March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 million and an additional $3.0 million in restricted cash subject to a cash collateral dominion agreement pursuant to our five-year term loan (the "Medley Term Loan") with Medley Capital Corporation ("Medley"). Our cash expenditures primarily relate to procurement of inventory and payment of salaries, benefits and other operating costs. Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been borrowings from various lenders and sales of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock (as defined below) to, and short-term loans from, affiliates of Pegasus Capital Advisors, L.P. ("Pegasus Capital"), including Pegasus IV, L.P. ("Pegasus Fund IV"), LSGC Holdings LLC, LSGC Holdings II, LSGC Holdings III, LLC ("Holdings III") and PCA LSG Holdings LLC ("PCA Holdings"). While Pegasus Capital and its affiliates (collectively, "Pegasus") have led the majority of our capital raises, the offerings of our Convertible Preferred Stock also involved and/or were led by parties other than Pegasus.  We obtained the five-year, $30.5 million Medley Term Loan from Medley on February 19, 2014 pursuant to a Term Loan Agreement (as amended, the "Medley Loan Agreement"). Pursuant to the Medley Loan Agreement, we are required to achieve a minimum quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio for the preceding 12-month period and to maintain certain minimum EBITDA levels.  We also obtained a three-year revolving credit facility with a maximum line amount of $22.5 million from Ares on April 25, 2014 pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the "Ares ABL Agreement"). As of March 31, 2016, we had $11.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Ares ABL Agreement and additional borrowing capacity of $2.7 million. The maximum borrowing capacity under the Ares ABL Agreement is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The Ares ABL Agreement also requires us to achieve a minimum quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio for the preceding 12-month period.  On January 30, 2015, September 11, 2015 and February 23, 2016, we issued 11,525, 10,000 and 3,000 units of our securities ("Series J Securities"), respectively, to Holdings III. On September 30, 2015, we issued 62 Series J Securities to certain existing preferred stockholders upon exercise of their preemptive rights under the certificates of designation governing the Series H Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series H Preferred Stock"), Series I Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series I Preferred Stock") and Series J Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series J Preferred Stock" and, collectively with the Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock, the "Convertible Preferred Stock"). In each case, the Series J Securities were issued at a purchase price of $1,000 per Series J Security and in accordance with the terms of separate subscription agreements with each of the preemptive rights purchasers and Holdings III. We received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $21.6 million and $3.0 million in connection with the issuances of Series J Securities during 2015 and the three months ended March 31, 2016, respectively. Each Series J Security consists of (a) one share of Series J Preferred Stock and (b) a warrant to purchase 2,650 shares of our Common Stock (a "Series J Warrant") at an exercise price of $0.001 per share of Common Stock.  We continue to face challenges in our efforts to achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operations. Our ability to continue to meet our obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent upon establishing profitable operations, which may be supplemented by any additional funds that we may raise through public or private financing or increased borrowing capacity.  In 2015, our largest customer, The Home Depot, performed a periodic product line review relating to its entire private label LED lighting product offering. Following the line review, we entered into a new supplier buying agreement with The Home Depot, which is expected to go into full effect in the second quarter of 2016. Pursuant to this supplier buying agreement, The Home Depot has elected to purchase certain products previously supplied by us directly from overseas suppliers. Such products represented a significant percentage of our sales to The Home Depot in 2015 and 2014. We were, however, selected to supply certain new products to The Home Depot and will continue to supply certain other products to The Home Depot under our prior agreement. In addition, the terms of the new supplier buying agreement with The Home Depot permit us to pursue opportunities to sell products to specified "big box" and other retailers, which was prohibited under our prior agreement. Notwithstanding the new supplier buying agreement, as was the case under our prior agreement with The Home Depot, The Home Depot is not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. As a result of the line review, we expect 2016 sales to The Home Depot and, as a result, revenue, to be significantly less than they were in 2015. However, because we cannot reasonably estimate the extent to which such reduced revenue may be offset by sales of the new products to The Home Depot or by any potential new sales to other retailers, we cannot determine at this time the overall impact that the results of The Home Depot line review will have on our financial . . .

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
