(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis covers the financial condition and results of operations of QTS Realty Trust, Inc. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the QTS Realty Trust, Inc.'s and QualityTech, LP's consolidated financial statements and related notes and "Risk Factors" contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our business and growth strategies, our expectations regarding the future performance of our business and the other non-historical statements contained herein are forward-looking statements. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." This Form 10-K contains stand-alone audited and unaudited financial statements and other financial data for each of QTS and the Operating Partnership. We believe it is important to show both QTS and the Operating Partnership's financial statements and for investors to understand the few differences between them in the context of how QTS and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. See "Explanatory Note" for an explanation of these few differences.  Since the financial data presented in this Item 7 does not contain any differences between QTS and the Operating Partnership, all periods presented reflect the operating results of the Operating Partnership.  Overview  We are a leading owner, developer and operator of state-of-the-art, carrier-neutral, multi-tenant data centers. Our data centers are facilities that house the network and computer equipment of multiple customers and provide access to a range of communications carriers. We have a fully integrated platform through which we own and operate our data centers and provide a broad range of IT infrastructure solutions. We refer to our spectrum of core data center products as our "3Cs," which consists of Custom Data Center, Colocation and Cloud and Managed Services. We believe that we own and operate one of the largest portfolios of multi-tenant data centers in the United States, as measured by gross square footage, and have the capacity to nearly double our leased raised floor without constructing or acquiring any new buildings.  We operate a portfolio of 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the Asia. Within the U.S., we are located in some of the top U.S. data center markets plus other high-growth markets. Our data centers are highly specialized, full-service, mission-critical facilities used by our customers to house, power and cool the networking equipment and computer systems that support their most critical business processes. We believe that our data centers are best-in-class and engineered to adhere to the highest specifications commercially available to customers, providing fully redundant, high-density power and cooling sufficient to meet the needs of major national and international companies and organizations. This is in part reflected by our operating track record of "five-nines" (99.999%) reliability and by our diverse customer base of more than 1,100 customers, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies.  QTS is a Maryland corporation formed on May 17, 2013 and is the sole general partner and majority owner of QualityTech, LP, our operating partnership. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. QTS' Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "QTS." As of December 31, 2016, QTS owned an approximate 87.6% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership formed on August 5, 2009 and was QTS' historical predecessor prior to the IPO, having operated the Company's business until the IPO.  We believe that QTS has operated and has been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Our qualification as a REIT, and maintenance of such qualification, depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distributions to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our equity shares.  Table of Contents  Our Customer Base  We provide data center solutions to a diverse set of customers. Our customer base is comprised of companies of all sizes representing an array of industries, each with unique and varied business models and needs. We serve Fortune 1000 companies as well as small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies.  Our Custom Data Center, or C1, customers typically are large enterprises with significant IT expertise and specific IT requirements, including financial institutions, "Big Four" accounting firms and the world's largest global Internet companies. Our Colocation, or C2, customers consist of a wide range of organizations, including major healthcare, telecommunications and software and web-based companies. Our C3 Cloud customers include both large organizations and SMBs seeking to reduce their capital expenditures and outsource their IT infrastructure on a flexible basis. Examples of current C3 Cloud customers include a global financial processing company and various U.S. government agencies.  As a result of our diverse customer base, customer concentration in our portfolio is limited. As of December 31, 2016, only three of our more than 1,100 customers individually accounted for more than 3% of our monthly recurring revenue ("MRR") (as defined below), with only one greater than 4% which accounted for approximately 13% of our MRR. In addition, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to customers who use more than one of our 3Cs products.  Our Portfolio  We develop and operate 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia, containing an aggregate of approximately 5.7 million gross square feet of space (approximately 91.9% of which is wholly owned by us), including approximately 2.5 million "basis-of-design" raised floor square feet, which represents the total data center raised floor potential of our existing data center facilities. This represents the maximum amount of space in our existing buildings that could be leased following full build-out, depending on the configuration that we deploy. We build out our data center facilities for both general use (colocation) and for executed leases that require significant amounts of space and power, depending on the needs of each facility at that time. As of December 31, 2016, this space included approximately 1,346,000 raised floor operating net rentable square feet, or NRSF, plus approximately 1.2 million square feet of additional raised floor in our development pipeline, of which approximately 151,000 NRSF is expected to become operational by December 31, 2017. Of the total 1.2 million NRSF in our development pipeline, none was related to customer leases which had been executed as of December 31, 2016 but not yet commenced. Our facilities collectively have access to over 650 megawatts ("MW") of gross utility power with 600 MW of available utility power. We believe such access to power gives us a competitive advantage in redeveloping data center space, since access to power is usually the most limiting and expensive component in data center redevelopment.  Key Operating Metrics  The following sets forth definitions for our key operating metrics. These metrics may differ from similar definitions used by other companies.  Monthly Recurring Revenue ("MRR"). We calculate MRR as monthly contractual revenue under signed leases as of a particular date, which includes revenue from our C1, C2 and C3 rental and cloud and managed services activities, but excludes customer recoveries, deferred set-up fees, variable related revenues, non-cash revenues and other one-time revenues. MRR does not include the impact from booked-not-billed leases as of a particular date, unless otherwise specifically noted. MRR does not reflect any accounting associated with any free rent, rent abatements or future scheduled rent increases and also excludes operating expense and power reimbursements.  Annualized Rent. We define annualized rent as MRR multiplied by 12.  Rental Churn. We define rental churn as the MRR lost in the period from a customer intending to fully exit our platform in the near term compared to the total MRR at the beginning of the period.  Leasable Raised Floor. We define leasable raised floor as the amount of raised floor square footage that we have leased plus the available capacity of raised floor square footage that is in a leasable format as of a particular date and according to a particular product configuration. The amount of our leasable raised floor may change even without completion of new redevelopment projects due to changes in our configuration of C1, C2 and C3 product space.

We define percentage occupied and billing raised floor as the square footage that is subject to a signed lease for which billing has commenced as of a particular date compared to leasable raised floor as of that date, expressed as a percentage.  Booked-not-Billed. We define booked-not-billed as our customer leases that have been signed, but for which lease payments have not yet commenced.  Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations and Cash Flows  Recent Accounting Pronouncements. We plan to adopt the provisions of ASC Topic 842, Leases, and ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective January 1, 2018. For additional information with respect to the impact of the standards on our financial condition and results of operations, refer to Item 8  Revenue. Our revenue growth will depend on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of leasable raised floor, lease currently available space, lease new capacity that becomes available as a result of our development and redevelopment activities, attract new customers and continue to meet the ongoing technological requirements of our customers. As of December 31, 2016, we had in place customer leases generating revenue for approximately 88% of our leasable raised floor. Our ability to grow revenue also will be affected by our ability to maintain or increase rental, cloud and managed services rates at our properties. Future economic downturns, regional downturns or downturns in the technology industry, new technological developments, evolving industry demands and other similar factors described above under "Risk Factors" could impair our ability to attract new customers or renew existing customers' leases on favorable terms, or at all, and could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet their obligations to us. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods, which would impact our results of operations and cash flows. We also at times may elect to reclaim space from customers in a negotiated transaction where we believe that we can redevelop and/or re-lease that space at higher rates, which may cause a decrease in revenue until the space is re-leased.  Leasing Arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, 35% of our MRR came from customers which individually occupied greater than or equal to 6,600 square feet of space (or approximately 1 MW of power). As of December 31, 2016, approximately 40% of our MRR was attributable to the metered power model. Under the metered power model, the customer pays us a fixed monthly rent amount, plus reimbursement of certain other operating costs, including actual costs of sub-metered electricity used to power its data center equipment and an estimate of costs for electricity used to power supporting infrastructure for the data center, expressed as a factor of the customer's actual electricity usage. Fluctuations in our customers' utilization of power and the supplier pricing of power do not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows under the metered power model. These leases generally have a minimum term of five years. As of December 31, 2016, 65% of our MRR was leased to customers which individually occupied less than 6,600 square feet of space. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to the gross lease model. Under a gross lease, the customer pays us a fixed rent on a monthly basis, and does not separately reimburse us for operating costs, including utilities, maintenance, repair, property taxes and insurance, as reimbursement for these costs is factored into MRR. However, if customers incur more utility costs than their leases permit, we are able to charge these customers for overages. For leases under the gross lease model, fluctuations in our customers' utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us will impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our leases on a gross lease basis generally have a term of three years or less.  Scheduled Lease Expirations. Our ability to minimize rental churn and customer downgrades at renewal and renew, lease and re-lease expiring space will impact our results of operations and cash flows. Leases which have commenced billing representing approximately 18% and 29% of our total leased raised floor are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 (including all month-to-month leases) and 2018, respectively. These leases also represented approximately 36% and 26%, respectively, of our annualized rent as of December 31, 2016. At expiration, as a general matter, based on current market conditions, we expect that expiring rents will be at or below the then-current market rents.  Acquisitions, Redevelopment and Financing. Our revenue growth also will depend on our ability to acquire and redevelop and subsequently lease data center space at favorable rates. We generally fund the cost of data center acquisition and redevelopment from our net cash provided by operations, credit facilities, other unsecured and secured  Table of Contents  borrowings or the issuance of additional equity. We believe that we have sufficient access to capital from our current cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our redevelopment projects.  Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses generally consist of direct personnel costs, utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, insurance and site maintenance costs and rental expenses on our ground and building leases. In particular, our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations conducted in them. Although substantially all of our long-term leases-leases with a term greater than three years-contain reimbursements for certain operating expenses, we will not in all instances be reimbursed for all of the property operating expenses we incur. We also incur general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to senior management, our in-house sales and marketing organization, cloud and managed services support personnel and legal, human resources, accounting and other expenses related to professional services. We also will incur additional expenses arising from being a publicly traded company, including employee equity-based compensation. Increases or decreases in our operating expenses will impact our results of operations and cash flows. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.  General Leasing Activity  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we entered into customer leases representing approximately $4.0 million of incremental MRR, net of downgrades (and representing approximately $48.0 million of annualized rent) at $609 per square foot. In addition, $13.8 million of leasing commissions was associated with new and renewal leasing activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we renewed leases with a total annualized rent of $48.7 million at an average rent per square foot of $623, which was 0.6% higher than the annualized rent prior to renewal. We define renewals as leases where the customer retains the same amount of space before and after renewal, which facilitates rate comparability. Customers that renew with adjustments to square feet are reflected in the net leasing activity discussed above. The rental churn rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was 5.6%.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we commenced customer leases representing approximately $10.8 million of incremental MRR (and representing approximately $129.0 million of annualized rent) at $601 per square foot.  As of December 31, 2016, our booked-not-billed MRR balance (which represents customer leases that have been executed, but for which lease payments have not commenced as of December 31, 2016) was approximately $3.6 million, or $43.1 million of annualized rent. This booked-not-billed balanced is expected to contribute an incremental $20.0 million to revenue in 2017 (representing $29.5 million in annualized revenues), an incremental $2.9 million in 2018 (representing $4.6 million in annualized revenues), and an incremental $8.9 million in annualized revenues thereafter.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 Changes in revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 are summarized below (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 $ Change % Change Revenues: Rental $ 295,723 $ 230,510 $ 65,213 28% Recoveries from customers 29,271 22,581 6,690 30% Cloud and managed services 68,488 51,994 16,494 32% Other 8,881 5,998 2,883 48% Total revenues 402,363 311,083 91,280 29% Operating expenses: Property operating costs 136,488 104,355 32,133 31% Real estate taxes and insurance 8,840 5,869 2,971 51% Depreciation and amortization 124,786 85,811 38,975 45% General and administrative 83,286 67,783 15,503 23% Transaction and integration costs 10,906 11,282 (376) -3% Total operating expenses 364,306 275,100 89,206 32% Operating income 38,057 35,983 2,074 6% Other income and expense: Interest income 3 2 1 50% Interest expense (23,159) (21,289) (1,870) 9% Other expense, net (192) (468) 276 -59% Income before taxes 14,709 14,228 481 3% Tax benefit of taxable REIT subsidiaries 9,976 10,065 (89) -1% Loss on sale of real estate - (164) 164 * Net income $ 24,685 $ 24,129 $ 556 2%  *not applicable for comparison  Revenues. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $402.4 million compared to $311.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $91.3 million, or 29%, was primarily due to a full year impact of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately six and a half months in 2015, which contributed $32.7 million to the increase. In addition, the acquisition of the Piscataway facility contributed $12.6 million in incremental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The balance aggregating $46.0 million related to organic growth in our customer base and placing additional square footage into service in conjunction with the development and expansion of our Irving, Atlanta-Metro, Richmond and Atlanta-Suwanee data centers.  The increase of $81.7 million, or 29%, in combined rental and cloud and managed services revenue was primarily due to the current period including a full year of the leased facilities acquired in 2015 compared to approximately a half year in 2015, which contributed $32.1 million to the increase, as well as the acquisition of the Piscataway facility in 2016 which contributed $7.1 million in incremental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additional increases, aggregating $42.5 million, are attributable to newly leased space primarily from ongoing expansions in our Atlanta-Metro, Irving and Richmond data centers and increases in rents from previously leased space, net of downgrades at renewal and rental churn.  As of December 31, 2016, our data centers were approximately 88% occupied and billing based on leasable raised floor of approximately 1,084,000 square feet, with approximately 956,000 square feet occupied and paying rent, with an average annualized rent of $390 per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue, or $323 per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue. As of December 31, 2016, the average annualized rent for our C1 product, including managed services for our C1 product, was $195 per leased raised  Table of Contents  floor square foot, and the average annualized rent for our C2 product, including Cloud and managed services combined was $1,246 per leased raised floor square foot. As of December 31, 2015, our data centers were approximately 91% occupied and billing based on leasable raised floor of approximately 839,000 square feet, with approximately 761,000 square feet occupied and paying rent, with an average annualized rent of $433 per leased raised floor square foot including cloud and managed services revenue, or $337 per leased raised floor square foot excluding cloud and managed services revenue. The increase in leasable raised floor between 2015 and 2016 is primarily related to the addition of raised floor square footage from our redevelopment activities primarily in the Irving, Atlanta-Metro, Richmond, Atlanta-Suwanee and Chicago facilities, as well as the acquisition of Piscataway. The decrease in average annualized rent per leased raised floor square foot, both including and excluding cloud and managed services revenue, is primarily due to an increase in mix of C1 customers in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, a larger portion of our product mix was attributable to C1 revenue (40% of MRR) compared to December 31, 2015 (34% of MRR). Due to the fact that C1 customers reimburse us for utilities and various other operating expenses and that reimbursement is excluded from the calculation of annualized rent per square foot, this increase in the portion of customer rent which is related to C1 customers has contributed to the weighted average per square foot reduction.  Higher recoveries from customers for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily due to reimbursements associated with the acquisition of the Piscataway facility which contributed $5.2 million to the increase. The remaining increase of $1.5 million in recoveries revenue was primarily attributable to the expansion of our Irving data center contributing $1.1 million to the increase and increased utility costs generally related to an increase in utility usage at our Atlanta-Metro data center contributing $1.1 million to the increase, offset by reduced reimbursements of $0.6 million at our Princeton facility due to lower operating costs we incurred from efficiencies gained as well as a $0.1 million decrease at various other facilities. The $2.9 million increase in other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to higher straight line rent.  Property Operating Costs. Property operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $136.5 million compared to property operating costs of $104.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $32.1 million, or 31%. The breakdown of our property operating costs is summarized in the table below (in thousands):   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 $ Change % Change Property operating costs: Direct payroll $ 21,118 $ 17,309 $ 3,809 22% Rent 17,705 12,912 4,793 37% Repairs and maintenance 14,081 9,695 4,386 45% Utilities 38,753 33,097 5,656 17% Management fee allocation 20,643 15,185 5,458 36% Other 24,188 16,157 8,031 50% Total property operating costs $ 136,488 $ 104,355 $ 32,133 31%  The acquisitions of leased facilities acquired in 2015 and the Piscataway facility contributed $23.2 million to the total increase in property operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2016, of which $1.3 million related to direct payroll, $4.7 million related to rent expense, $3.7 million related to repairs and maintenance, $3.8 million related to utilities, $3.7 million related to management fee allocation and $6.0 million related to other property operating costs, of which $4.1 million were associated with connectivity expenses. Management fee allocation for leased facilities acquired in 2015 is based on 10% of cash revenues for each facility and reflects an allocation of internal charges to cover back-office and service-related costs associated with the day-to-day operations of these data center facilities, with a corresponding offset to general and administrative expenses. The remaining $8.9 million increase in total property operating costs was primarily attributable to expansion of our existing facilities, which included increased direct payroll allocation of $2.5 million throughout our facilities, $0.6 million of increased repairs and maintenance expense which tends to fluctuate from period to period and will increase with the expansion and lease-up of our facilities, increased utility expense of $1.8 million primarily related to the expansion of our Irving data center, and other expenses of $2.3 million.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis presents the financial condition and results of operations of QTS Realty Trust, Inc. ("QTS"), which includes the operations of QualityTech, LP (the "Operating Partnership"), for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with QTS' and the Operating Partnership's accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between the financial statements of QTS and the Operating Partnership. See "Explanatory Note" for an explanation of these few differences. Since the financial data presented in this Item 2 does not contain any differences between QTS and the Operating Partnership, all periods presented reflect the operating results of both QTS and the Operating Partnership.  Forward-Looking Statements  Some of the statements contained in this Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources, portfolio performance and results of operations contain forward-looking statements. Likewise, all of our statements regarding anticipated growth in our funds from operations and anticipated market conditions are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "intends," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," or "potential" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar  Table of Contents  words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. You also can identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions.  The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q reflect our current views about future events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause our actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:  * adverse economic or real estate developments in our markets or the technology industry;  * global, national and local economic conditions;  * risks related to our international operations;  * difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and completing acquisitions;  * our failure to successfully develop, redevelop and operate acquired properties or lines of business;  * significant increases in construction and development costs;  * the increasingly competitive environment in which we operate;  * defaults on, or termination or non-renewal of, leases by customers;  * increased interest rates and operating costs, including increased energy costs;  * financing risks, including our failure to obtain necessary outside financing;  * decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates;  * dependence on third parties to provide Internet, telecommunications and network connectivity to our data centers;  * our failure to qualify and maintain QTS' qualification as a real estate investment trust ("REIT");  * environmental uncertainties and risks related to natural disasters;  * financial market fluctuations; and  * changes in real estate and zoning laws, revaluations for tax purposes and increases in real property tax rates.  While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it was made. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, of new information, data or methods, future events or other changes. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-Q.  Table of Contents  Overview  We are a leading provider of secure, compliant data center solutions, hybrid cloud and fully managed services. We refer to our spectrum of core data center products as our "3Cs," which consist of Custom Data Center ("C1"), Colocation ("C2") and Cloud and Managed Services ("C3"). Our 3C integrated technology platform provides flexible, scalable, secure IT solutions for web and IT applications.  We operate a portfolio of 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Within the United States, we are located in some of the top U.S. data center markets plus other high-growth markets. Our data centers are highly specialized, full-service, mission-critical facilities used by our customers to house, power and cool the networking equipment and computer systems that support their most critical business processes. We believe that our data centers are best-in-class and engineered to adhere to the highest specifications commercially available to customers, providing fully redundant, high-density power and cooling sufficient to meet the needs of major national and international companies and organizations. This is in part reflected by our operating track record of "five-nines" (99.999%) reliability and by our diverse customer base of more than 1,100 customers, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies.  We account for the operations of all of our properties in one reporting segment.  As of March 31, 2017, QTS owned an approximate 87.6% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership formed on August 5, 2009 and was QTS' historical predecessor prior to the initial public offering ("IPO"), having operated the Company's business until the IPO.  We believe that QTS has operated and has been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Our qualification as a REIT, and maintenance of such qualification, depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distributions to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our equity shares.  Our Customer Base  We provide data center solutions to a diverse set of customers. Our customer base is comprised of companies of all sizes representing an array of industries, each with unique and varied business models and needs. We serve Fortune 1000 companies as well as small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies.  Our Custom Data Center, or C1, customers typically are large enterprises with significant IT expertise and specific IT requirements, including financial institutions, "Big Four" accounting firms and the world's largest global Internet companies. Our Colocation, or C2, customers consist of a wide range of organizations, including major healthcare, telecommunications and software and web-based companies. Our C3 Cloud customers include both large organizations and SMBs seeking to reduce their capital expenditures and outsource their IT infrastructure on a flexible basis. Examples of current C3 Cloud customers include a global financial processing company and various U.S. government agencies.  As a result of our diverse customer base, customer concentration in our portfolio is limited. As of March 31, 2017, only three of our more than 1,100 customers individually accounted for more than 3% of our monthly recurring revenue ("MRR") (as defined below), with the largest customer accounting for approximately 13.2% of our MRR and the next largest customer accounting for only 4.2% of our MRR. In addition, approximately 60% of our MRR was attributable to customers who use more than one of our 3C products.  Table of Contents  Our Portfolio  We develop and operate 25 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia, containing an aggregate of approximately 5.7 million gross square feet of space (approximately 92% of which is wholly owned by us), including approximately 2.5 million "basis-of-design" raised floor square feet, which represents the total data center raised floor potential of our existing data center facilities. This represents the maximum amount of space in our existing buildings that could be leased following full build-out, depending on the configuration that we deploy. We build out our data center facilities for both general use (colocation) and for executed leases that require significant amounts of space and power, depending on the needs of each facility at that time. As of March 31, 2017, this space included approximately 1,377,000 raised floor operating net rentable square feet, or NRSF, plus approximately 1.1 million square feet of additional raised floor in our development pipeline, of which approximately 131,000 NRSF is expected to become operational by December 31, 2017. Of the total 1.1 million NRSF in our development pipeline, none was related to customer leases which had been executed but not yet commenced. Our facilities collectively have access to over 650 megawatts ("MW") of gross utility power with 600 MW of available utility power. We believe such access to power gives us a competitive advantage in redeveloping data center space, since access to power is usually the most limiting and expensive component in data center redevelopment.

With respect to leased properties, gross square feet represents that portion of the gross square feet subject to our lease. Gross square feet includes 347,261 square feet of our office and support space, which is not included in operating NRSF.  (3) Represents the total square feet of a building that is currently leased or available for lease plus developed supporting infrastructure, based on engineering drawings and estimates, but does not include space held for redevelopment or space used for our own office space.  Table of Contents  (4) Represents management's estimate of the portion of NRSF of the facility with available power and cooling capacity that is currently leased or readily available to be leased to customers as data center space based on engineering drawings.  (5) Represents the operating NRSF of the facility other than data center space (typically office and storage space) that is currently leased or available to be leased.  (6) Represents required data center support space, including mechanical, telecommunications and utility rooms, as well as building common areas.  (7) Calculated as data center raised floor that is subject to a signed lease for which space is occupied (949,355 square feet as of March 31, 2017) divided by leasable raised floor based on the current configuration of the properties (1,084,001 square feet as of March 31, 2017), expressed as a percentage.  (8) We define annualized rent as MRR multiplied by 12. We calculate MRR as monthly contractual revenue under executed contracts as of a particular date, which includes revenue from our C1, C2 and C3 rental and cloud and managed services activities, but excludes customer recoveries, deferred set up fees, variable related revenues, non-cash revenues and other one-time revenues. MRR does not include the impact from booked-not-billed contracts as of a particular date, unless otherwise specifically noted. This amount reflects the annualized cash rental payments. It does not reflect the accounting associated with any free rent, rent abatements or future scheduled rent increases and also excludes operating expense and power reimbursements.  (9) Represents installed utility power and transformation capacity that is available for use by the facility as of March 31, 2017.  * Subject to long term ground lease.  ** Includes 13 facilities. All facilities are leased, including those subject to capital leases. During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company moved its Jersey City, NJ facility to the "Leased facilities" line item.  *** Consists of Miami, FL; Lenexa, KS; Overland Park, KS; and Duluth, GA facilities. During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company moved its Miami, FL facility to the "Other" line item.  Key Operating Metrics  The following sets forth definitions for our key operating metrics. These metrics may differ from similar definitions used by other companies.  Monthly Recurring Revenue ("MRR"). We calculate MRR as monthly contractual revenue under signed leases as of a particular date, which includes revenue from our C1, C2 and C3 rental and cloud and managed services activities, but excludes customer recoveries, deferred set-up fees, variable related revenues, non-cash revenues and other one-time revenues. MRR does not include the impact from booked-not-billed leases as of a particular date, unless otherwise specifically noted.  Annualized Rent. We define annualized rent as MRR multiplied by 12.  Rental Churn. We define rental churn as the MRR lost in the period due to a customer intending to fully exit the QTS platform in the near term compared to total MRR at the beginning of the period.  Leasable Raised Floor. We define leasable raised floor as the amount of raised floor square footage that we have leased plus the available capacity of raised floor square footage that is in a leasable format as of a particular date and according to a particular product configuration. The amount of our leasable raised floor may change even without completion of new redevelopment projects due to changes in our configuration of C1, C2 and C3 product space.  Percentage (%) Occupied. We define percentage occupied as the square footage that is subject to a signed lease for which space is occupied as of a particular date compared to leasable raised floor as of that date, expressed as a percentage.  Booked-not-Billed. We define booked-not-billed as our customer leases that have been signed, but for which lease payments have not yet commenced.  Table of Contents  Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations and Cash Flows  Revenue. Our revenue growth will depend on our ability to maintain the historical occupancy rates of leasable raised floor, lease currently available space, lease new capacity that becomes available as a result of our development and redevelopment activities, attract new customers and continue to meet the ongoing technological requirements of our customers. As of March 31, 2017, we had in place customer leases generating revenue for approximately 88% of our leasable raised floor. Our ability to grow revenue also will be affected by our ability to maintain or increase rental, cloud and managed services rates at our properties. Future economic downturns, regional downturns or downturns in the technology industry could impair our ability to attract new customers or renew existing customers' leases on favorable terms, or at all, and could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet their obligations to us. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods, which would impact our results of operations and cash flows. We also at times may elect to reclaim space from customers in a negotiated transaction where we believe that we can redevelop and/or re-lease that space at higher rates, which may cause a decrease in revenue until the space is re-leased.  Leasing Arrangements. As of March 31, 2017, 34% of our MRR came from customers which individually occupied greater than or equal to 6,600 square feet of space (or approximately 1 MW of power). As of March 31, 2017, approximately 42% of our MRR was attributable to the metered power model. Under the metered power model, the customer pays us a fixed monthly rent amount, plus reimbursement of certain other operating costs, including actual costs of sub-metered electricity used to power its data center equipment and an estimate of costs for electricity used to power supporting infrastructure for the data center, expressed as a factor of the customer's actual electricity usage. Fluctuations in our customers' utilization of power and the supplier pricing of power do not significantly impact our results of operations or cash flows under the metered power model. These leases generally have a minimum term of five years. As of March 31, 2017, 66% of our MRR was leased to customers which individually occupied less than 6,600 square feet of space. As of March 31, 2017, approximately 58% of our MRR was attributable to the gross lease model. Under a gross lease, the customer pays us a fixed rent on a monthly basis, and does not separately reimburse us for operating costs, including utilities, maintenance, repair, property taxes and insurance, as reimbursement for these costs is factored into MRR. However, if customers access more utility costs than their leases permit, we are able to charge these customers for overages. For leases under the gross lease model, fluctuations in our customers' utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us will impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our leases on a gross lease basis generally have a term of three years or less.  Scheduled Lease Expirations. Our ability to minimize rental churn and customer downgrades at renewal and renew, lease and re-lease expiring space will impact our results of operations and cash flows. Leases which have commenced billing representing approximately 11% and 30% of our total leased raised floor are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 (including all month-to-month leases) and 2018, respectively. These leases also represented approximately 28% and 28%, respectively, of our annualized rent as of March 31, 2017. Given that our average rent for larger contracts tend to be at or below market rent at expiration, as a general matter, based on current market conditions, we expect that expiring rents will be at or below the then-current market rents.  Acquisitions, Redevelopment and Financing. Our revenue growth also will depend on our ability to acquire and redevelop and subsequently lease data center space at favorable rates. We generally fund the cost of data center acquisition and redevelopment from our net cash provided by operations, revolving credit facility, other unsecured and secured borrowings or the issuance of additional equity. We believe that we have sufficient access to capital from our current cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our credit facility to fund our redevelopment projects.  Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses generally consist of direct personnel costs, utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, insurance and site maintenance costs and rental expenses on our ground and building leases. In particular, our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations conducted in them. Although substantially all of our long-term leases-leases with a term greater than three years-contain reimbursements for certain operating expenses, we will not in all instances be reimbursed for all of the property operating expenses we incur. We also incur general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to senior management, our in-house sales and marketing organization, cloud and managed services support personnel and legal, human resources, accounting and other expenses related to professional services. We also incur additional expenses arising from being a publicly traded  Table of Contents  company, including employee equity-based compensation. Increases or decreases in our operating expenses will impact our results of operations and cash flows. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.  General Leasing Activity  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we entered into customer leases representing approximately $0.4 million of incremental MRR, net of downgrades (and representing approximately $4.3 million of incremental annualized rent, net of downgrades) at $849 per square foot. In addition, $2.9 million of leasing commissions was associated with new and renewal leasing activity for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we renewed leases with a total annualized rent of $7.8 million at an average rent per square foot of $661, which was 2.6% higher than the annualized rent prior to their respective renewals. Customers that renew with adjustments to square feet are reflected in the net leasing activity discussed above. The rental churn rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 3.3%, the majority of which was the result of a single customer termination in one of the Company's leased facilities in Northern Virginia which was disclosed in prior quarters. Excluding this customer termination, rental churn for the first quarter of 2017 would be 0.7%.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we commenced customer leases representing approximately $2.1 million of MRR (and representing approximately $24.7 million of annualized rent) at $418 per square foot.  As of March 31, 2017, our booked-not-billed MRR balance (which represents customer leases that have been executed, but for which lease payments have not commenced as of March 31, 2017) was approximately $3.5 million, or $41.9 million of annualized rent. The booked-not-billed balance is expected to contribute an incremental $15.3 million to revenue in 2017 (representing $27.9 million in annualized revenues), an incremental $2.9 million in 2018 (representing $4.7 million in annualized revenues) and an incremental $9.2 million in annualized revenues thereafter.  We estimate the remaining capital cost to provide the space, power, connectivity and other services to the customer contracts which had been booked but not billed as of March 31, 2017 to be approximately $7 million. This estimate generally includes C1 customers with newly contracted space of more than 3,300 square feet. The space, power, connectivity and other services provided to customers that contract for smaller amounts of space is generally provided by existing space which was previously developed.  . . .

QualityTech, LP Key Developments

QualityTech, LP Enters into Unsecured Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
Dec 22 16
On December 20, 2016, QualityTech, LP entered into an unsecured Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association, as agent, the lenders party thereto, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and TD Securities (USA) LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and Bank of America, N.A. and TD Securities (USA) LLC, as co-syndication agents. The Amended and Restated Agreement amended and restated the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of October 27, 2015 by and among the Operating Partnership, the lenders party thereto, KeyBank National Association, as agent, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as co-syndication agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as co-syndication agent, Regions Bank, as co-syndication agent, and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Regions Capital Markets, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. The Amended and Restated Agreement is guaranteed by substantially all of the Operating Partnerships subsidiaries. The Amended and Restated Agreement provides for a term loan of $300 million, maturing on December 17, 2021, an additional term loan of $200 million, maturing on April 27, 2022, and a revolving credit facility of $700 million, maturing on December 17, 2020, with the option to extend until December 17, 2021, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions (collectively, the Unsecured Credit Facility). The Unsecured Credit Facility may be increased to up to $1.5 billion, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the agent and obtaining necessary commitments. The lenders under the Unsecured Credit Facility may issue up to $30 million in letters of credit subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. As of December 20, 2016, the term loans were fully funded and $139.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The availability under the revolving credit facility is the lesser of $700 million, 60% of the unencumbered asset pool capitalized value (or 65% of the unencumbered asset pool capitalized value for the two consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition for which the Operating Partnership has provided written notice to the Agent) and the amount resulting in an unencumbered asset pool debt yield of 14% (or 12.5% for the two consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition for which the Operating Partnership has provided written notice to the Agent). In the case of clauses and of the preceding sentence, the amount available under the revolving credit facility is adjusted to take into account any other unsecured debt and certain capitalized leases. A material acquisition is an acquisition of properties or assets with a gross purchase price equal to or in excess of 15% of the Operating Partnership's gross asset value (as defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement) as of the end of the most recently ended quarter for which financial statements are publicly available. Amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Agreement bear interest at a variable rate equal to, at the Operating Partnerships election, LIBOR or a base rate, plus a spread that will vary depending upon the company's leverage ratio. For revolving credit loans, the spread ranges from 1.55% to 2.15% for LIBOR loans and 0.55% to 1.15% for base rate loans. For term loans, the spread ranges from 1.50% to 2.10% for LIBOR loans and 0.50% to 1.10% for base rate loans. As of December 20, 2016, the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Agreement was 2.22% for revolving credit loans and 2.16% for term loans. Upon obtaining an investment grade rating, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement permits the Operating Partnership to request revolving loan borrowings with interest rates and terms that are to be set pursuant to competitive bid procedures ("bid loans"); however, the lenders are not required to extend borrowings pursuant to such competitive bid procedures. The sum of all outstanding bid loans may not exceed 50% of the total revolving credit commitment. The bid loan sublimit is a part of, and not in addition to, the total revolving credit commitment.


QualityTech, LP Enters into Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Keybank National Association
Nov 2 15
On October 27, 2015, QualityTech, LP (the “Operating Partnership”), the operating partnership of QTS Realty Trust Inc. (the “Company”), entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association, as agent, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., Citizens Bank, National Association f/k/a RBS Citizens, N.A., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Regions Bank, SunTrust Bank and Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC, as co-syndication agents, and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Regions Capital Markets, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. The Amended and Restated Agreement amended and restated the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of December 17, 2014 by and among the Operating Partnership, the lenders party thereto, KeyBank National Association, as agent, Bank of America, N.A., as co-syndication agent, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as co-syndication agent, and Regions Bank, as co-syndication agent, and KeyBanc Capital Markets, as sole lead arranger and sole book manager, as amended. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Agreement are unsecured and guaranteed by substantially all of the Operating Partnership’s subsidiaries. The Amended and Restated Agreement provides for a term loan of $150 million, maturing on December 17, 2020 ("Term Loan A"), an additional term loan of $150 million, maturing on April 27, 2021 ("Term Loan B"), and a revolving credit facility of $600 million, maturing on December 17, 2019, with the option to extend until December 17, 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions (collectively, the “Unsecured Credit Facility”). The Unsecured Credit Facility may be increased to up to $1.1 billion, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the agent and obtaining necessary commitments. The lenders under the Unsecured Credit Facility may issue up to $30 million in letters of credit subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. As of October 27, 2015, the term loans were fully funded, $206 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and there was an additional $2.0 million letter of credit outstanding. The availability under the revolving credit facility is the lesser of (i) $600 million, (ii) 60% of the unencumbered asset pool capitalized value and (iii) the amount resulting in an unencumbered asset pool debt yield of 14%. In the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence, the amount available under the revolving credit facility is adjusted to take into account any other unsecured debt and certain capitalized leases. Amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Agreement bear interest at a variable rate equal to, at the Operating Partnership’s election, LIBOR or a base rate, plus a spread that will vary depending upon the Company’s leverage ratio. For revolving credit loans, the spread ranges from 1.55% to 2.15% for LIBOR loans and 0.55% to 1.15% for base rate loans. For term loans, the spread ranges from 1.50% to 2.10% for LIBOR loans and 0.50% to 1.10% for base rate loans. As of October 27, 2015, the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Agreement was 1.75% for revolving credit loans and 1.69% for term loans.

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
