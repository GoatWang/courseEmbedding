There is no charge for the service; however, if a transaction overdraws the account, overdraft fees may apply.We offer Overdraft Protection on some checking products, which would link your checking account to a line of credit or savings account. This service automatically transfers funds when your account goes into the negative. While there are fees associated with using Overdraft Protection, it is generally less expensive than being assessed standard overdraft fees.

What is the “Pending Transaction” I keep seeing on my Online Banking transaction history listing?








“Pending Transactions” can represent 2 types of activities on your account:One type is a recent deposit where checks or other items included in your deposit were from a bank other than Old National and are therefore not available for you to immediately withdraw. It will show as both a deposit, and a “pending transaction” until Old National collects the funds from the other bank. This could be as soon as the next business day after your deposit is made.The second type is a recent transaction that you authorized using your ATM or debit card. This could be a withdrawal at an ATM or a purchase you made from a merchant.  Unfortunately, due to current system limitations, you cannot see specific details such as the name of the store where you made a purchase. We are working to add this detail but for now it will show as a pending transaction.

History[edit]




An Old National Bank location in Granger, Indiana


The bank was founded in 1834 as the city's first bank. It has operated under several names, including Evansville National Bank and Old State National Bank. In 1922, it was officially named Old National Bank. At the time the stock market crashed in 1929, there were 11 banks operating in Evansville; by 1935, seven of those banks had been forced to close their doors. Old National was one of the four that continued to operate. In anticipation of the impending reform of banking regulations at the state and federal levels in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the bank holding company called Old National Bancorp was formed in 1983 as a multi-bank holding company and now operates in Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Kentucky and Illinois[3]
Old National participated in the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) with the Treasury Department buying $100 million in preferred, non-voting stock. However, by March 2009 Old National had repurchased all of its outstanding stock and had fully exited the TARP program.
In 2009 Charter One's Indiana bank branches became Old National Bank after Old National Bank bought Charter One's Indiana operations.[4] In 2011 Integra Bank was closed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and all deposit accounts, excluding certain brokered deposits, were transferred to Old National. In 2012, Old National acquired 24 retail bank branches of Bank of America in northern Indiana and southwest Michigan.[5] In 2014, Old National acquired four banks: Tower Bank in Fort Wayne, Indiana, United Bank in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Lafayette Savings Bank in Lafayette, Indiana, and Founders Bank & Trust in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
In January 2016, Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin, the parent company of AnchorBank, the third-largest bank based in Wisconsin, announced that Old National intends to buy Anchor for approximately $461 million. The transaction closed in May of the same year. [6]
Services[edit]
The company offers cash management services, lease financing, debit cards, online banking, and other electronically accessed banking services. Old National Bancorp, through other subsidiaries, also provides various services, including investment advisory and wealth management, investment and brokerage, investment consulting, and insurance agency services.
In 1995, ONB was ranked number one in earnings momentum by banking journal Financial World. The bank was rated the 28th top performing bank in the nation for 2008 by Bank Director magazine.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
