	Organization
	and Description of Business





	 



	Luboa Group, Inc. (the “Company”), formerly
	known as Sunrise Tours, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 19, 2013 (“Inception”).
	On January 20, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada and changed its corporate
	name to “Luboa Group Inc.” Concurrent with the change of corporate name, the Company also changed its principal business
	plan from developing and offering special services such as 3D virtual tours for companies which would like to promote their venues
	on the Internet and electronic media, to developing specialized agricultural products and a carbon emission trading platform in
	Asia. However, as of February 28, 2017, no definitive agreement had been entered into in connection with the business plan. The
	Company’s principal headquarters is located in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. From Inception through February 28, 2017, the Company
	accumulated losses of approximately $110,496.

	2014-10, “Development Stage Entities”. The amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage
	entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), thereby removing the financial reporting
	distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from generally accepted accounting principles in the
	United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage
	entities to (1) present inception-to- date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label
	the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities
	in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity
	that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments in this update are applied retrospectively. The adoption
	of ASU 2014-10 removed the development stage entity financial reporting requirements for the Company.




	 




	NOTE
	2 – GOING CONCERN




	 




	The
	Company has incurred loss since Inception resulting in accumulated deficit of approximately $110,496 as of February 28, 2017,
	and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business plan. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.




	 




	The
	ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining
	the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
	due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from related parties and/or the issuance
	of equity and debt securities.




	 




	NOTE
	3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation




	The accompanying financial statements of the Company
	have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are presented in U.S. dollars. The Company’s fiscal year-end is August
	31. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair
	presentation of the financial statements have been included. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected
	for the full year. The information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information
	included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2016 (the “Annual Report”).



	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	For
	purposes of the accompanying statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original
	maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’s funds are deposited in insured institutions. The
	funds are insured for up to $250,000. At February 28, 2017, the Company’s funds did not exceed the insured amount.




	 





	Basic
	and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share





	The
	Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings per Share”, which requires presentation
	of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
	net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.
	Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss
	per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.




	 











	 



	4



	 












	 




	For
	the three month periods ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016, there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity
	instruments issued or outstanding and any such shares would have been excluded from the computation because they would have
	been anti-dilutive as the Company incurred losses in these periods.




	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	ASC
	820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
	inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used
	in measuring fair value are observable in the market.




	 




	These
	tiers include:




	 




	Level
	1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;




	 




	Level
	2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and



	 



	Level
	3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
	The carrying value of cash and the Company’s loan from a shareholder approximates its fair value due to their short-term
	maturity.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	The
	Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Under ASC 740 deferred income taxes are
	provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss
	carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
	between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
	when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
	realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period, if any, and the change during the period in
	deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and
	rates on the date of enactment.




	 




	ASC
	740 also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Under ASC
	740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not
	to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. At February 28, 2017, there were no unrecognized tax benefits.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	The
	Company will recognize revenue in accordance with ASC No. 605, “Revenue Recognition”. ASC-605 requires that four basic
	criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred;
	(3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and
	(4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability
	of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are
	provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not
	been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has
	been delivered or no refund will be required.




	 





	Advertising
	Costs





	The
	Company’s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense
	of $0 during six month periods ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	Management
	has reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, and does not believe any of these pronouncements
	will have a material impact on the Company.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements
	and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	Stock-Based
	Compensation





	As
	of February 28, 2017, the Company had not issued any stock-based payments to its employees.




	 




	Stock-based
	compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable. To date, the Company has not adopted
	a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.




	 




	NOTE
	4 – COMMON STOCK




	 




	The
	Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $ 0.001 per share.




	 




	On
	September 23, 2013, the Company issued 9,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $9,000.




	 




	For
	the year ended August 31, 2016, the Company issued 2,600,000 shares at $0.01 per share for total proceeds of $26,000.




	 




	As
	at February 28, 2017, 11,600,000 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. See Note 8 (Change of Control) regarding
	the January 8, 2016 transaction resulting in the ownership change as of approximately 77.59% of these common shares.




	 




	NOTE
	5 – INCOME TAXES




	 




	As
	of February 28, 2017, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $110,496 that may be available to reduce
	future years’ taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been
	recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company
	has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.




	 




	NOTE
	6 – PREPAID EXPENSES




	 




	On
	September 15, 2016, the Company prepaid $10,000 to OTC Market Group Inc. for its annual fee from November 1, 2016 to October 31,
	2017. $5,833 of such amount is classified as prepaid expenses as of February 28, 2017.




	 




	NOTE
	7 – LOAN FROM SHAREHOLDER




	 




	The
	Company relies on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate
	financing through sales of equity or debt securities. There is no formal written commitment for continued support from such related
	parties. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature
	and have not been formalized by a promissory note.




	 




	From
	Inception through January 8, 2016, the Company’s then sole shareholder and director Alexander Karpetskiy loaned the Company
	$15,066 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses. The loan was non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.
	As of January 8, 2016, the amount outstanding was $14,429. As a result of the change of control described in Note 8, the entire
	unpaid balance of the loan was discharged by Mr. Karpetskiy.





	 






	Since January 14, 2016, a current director who is also
	one of the Company’s major shareholders has loaned the Company $65,821 to pay for operating expenses. As of February 28,
	2017, the amount outstanding was $65,821. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.



	 




	NOTE
	8 – CHANGE OF CONTROL




	 




	On
	January 8, 2016 (the “Closing Date”), Mr. Karpetskiy entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”)
	with Hsin-Nan Lin, pursuant to which Mr. Lin acquired from Mr. Karpetskiy all 9 million shares of the Company’s common stock
	owned by him. Pursuant to the SPA, all of the Company’s outstanding liabilities as of the Closing Date, including the outstanding
	balance of Mr. Karpetskiy’s loan, were fully paid by utilizing cash on hand (or discharged in the case of Mr. Karpetskiy’s
	loan). As a result, the Company was relieved of unpaid shareholder loan in the amount of $14,428, which is recorded by the Company
	as additional paid-in capital as of February 28, 2017.




	 






	NOTE
	9 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS




	 




	In
	accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to February 28, 2017 to the date these financial
	statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial
	statements.

	ITEM
	2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION





	 






	General






	 





	We
	were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2013 under the name “Sunrise Tours, Inc.” On January 20, 2016,
	we amended our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to “Luboa Group, Inc.” in connection with our new business
	plan as described below. Our business office is located at 3 F, No. 102, Bo'ai 2nd Road, Zuoying District, Kaohsiung City, 813.
	Taiwan. Our telephone number is 886- 75570551.




	 




	Business
	Plan





	 





	Prior
	to our corporate name change on January 20, 2016, we planned to offer special service such as 3D virtual tours for companies which
	would like to promote their venues on the Internet, optical disks and hard and flash drives. Concurrent with our name change,
	we have changed our business plan to developing specialized agricultural products and a carbon emission trading platform in Asia.
	However, as of February 28, 2017, we have not entered into any definitive agreement in connection with our new business plan.




	 




	Results
	of Operations





	 





	As
	of February 28, 2017, we had total assets of $5,833 and total liabilities of $66,899. We anticipate that we will continue to incur
	substantial losses in the next 12 months. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going
	concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We may raise additional capital
	through, among other things, sale of equity or debt securities.

	during the six-month periods ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016 was $0.


	 




	Cash
	Flows from Financing Activities







	 






	We
	have financed our operations primarily from either loans from related parties or the issuance of equity and debt instruments.




	 











	 



	9



	 












	 




	For
	the three-month periods ended February 28, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $19,187 (cash proceeds of loans
	from shareholder). For the three-month periods ended February 29, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $10,546,
	which included shareholder loan of $12,600, and cash repayment of a shareholder loan for $2,054.




	 




	For
	the six-month period ended February 28, 2017, net cash flows provided by financing activities was $37,637 (cash proceeds of loan
	from shareholder). For the six-month period ended February 29, 2016, net cash flows provided by financing activities was $10,546,
	which included shareholder loan of $12,600, and cash repayment of a shareholder loan for $2,054.




	 




	Plan
	of Operations and Funding





	 





	We
	expect that our working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of related party loans and issuances
	of securities. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Our working capital requirements are expected
	to increase if and when we are able to execute on our current business plan. As of February 28, 2017, we had working capital deficit
	of $61,066.




	 




	We
	expect to fund our operations over the next three months with further loans from related parties. In connection with our business
	plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental
	expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional
	capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities
	will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior
	to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
	or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities,
	which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.




	 




	Material
	Commitments





	 





	As
	of the date of this report, we do not have any material commitments.




	 




	Purchase
	of Significant Equipment





	 





	We
	do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.




	 




	Off-balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 





	As
	of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
	or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
	capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.




	 




	Going
	Concern





	 





	The
	independent auditors' report accompanying our August 31, 2016 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming
	that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities
	and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

	4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 





	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
	13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
	the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
	specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
	and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
	under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer
	or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	An
	evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design
	and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of February 28, 2017. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded
	that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed
	in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
	periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial
	reporting during the three-month period ended February 28, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
	affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	1.




	I
	have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of LUBOA GROUP, INC.;

	Based
	on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or
	omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
	circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
	period covered by quarterly report;






	 








	3.




	Based
	on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in
	this Report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results
	of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented
	in this report;






	 








	4.




	The
	registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining

	the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known within those entities,
	particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;






	 








	(b)




	designed
	such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over

	regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
	for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;






	 








	(c)




	evaluated
	the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented
	in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
	procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;






	 








	(d)




	disclosed
	in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting
	that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth
	fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably
	likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;
	and






	 








	5.




	The
	registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
	evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors
	and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing
	the equivalent functions):






	 








	(a)




	all
	significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
	control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
	registrant's ability to record, process summarize and report financial information; and






	 








	(b)




	any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
	a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

	30, 2016





	 




	NOTE
	1 – ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS




	 





	Organization
	and Description of Business





	 




	Luboa
	Group, Inc. (the “Company”), formerly known as Sunrise Tours, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of
	Nevada on March 19, 2013 (“Inception”), and has adopted August 31 fiscal year end.  On January 20, 2016, the
	Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada and changed its corporate name to “Luboa
	Group Inc.” Concurrent with the change of corporate name, the Company also changed its principal business plan from developing
	and offering special services such as 3D virtual tours for companies which would like to promote their venues on the Internet
	and electronic media, to developing specialized agricultural products and a carbon emission trading platform in Asia. However,
	as of November 30, 2016, no definitive agreement had been entered into in connection with the business plan. The Company’s
	principal headquarters is located in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan

	.

	From Inception through November 30, 2016, the Company accumulated
	losses of approximately $102,477.




	 




	In
	June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
	2014-10, “Development Stage Entities”. The amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage
	entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), thereby removing the financial reporting
	distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from generally accepted accounting principles in the
	United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage
	entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label
	the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities
	in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity
	that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments in this update are applied retrospectively. The adoption
	of ASU 2014-10 removed the development stage entity financial reporting requirements for the Company.




	 




	NOTE
	2 – GOING CONCERN




	 




	The
	Company has incurred loss since Inception resulting in accumulated deficit of approximately $102,477 as of November 30, 2016,
	and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business plan.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about
	the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  




	 




	The
	ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining
	the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
	due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from related parties and/or the
	issuance of equity and debt securities.  




	 




	NOTE
	3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	The
	accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are presented in US dollars.
	The Company’s fiscal year-end is August 31.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	For
	purposes of the accompanying statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original
	maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company’s funds are deposited in insured institutions. The
	funds are insured for up to $250,000. At November 30, 2016, the Company’s funds did not exceed the insured amount.




	 





	Basic
	and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share





	The
	Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings per Share”, which requires presentation
	of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
	net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.
	Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive
	loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.




	 




	For
	the three month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued
	or outstanding and any such shares would have been excluded from the computation because they would have been anti-dilutive as
	the Company incurred losses in these periods.




	 







	 



	4



	 












	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	ASC
	820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
	inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used
	in measuring fair value are observable in the market.




	 




	These
	tiers include:




	 




	Level
	1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;




	Level
	2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and




	Level
	3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its
	own assumptions.




	 




	The
	carrying value of cash and the Company’s loan from a shareholder approximates its fair value due to their short-term maturity.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	The
	Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Under ASC 740 deferred income taxes are
	provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss
	carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
	between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
	when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
	realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period, if any, and the change during the period in
	deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and
	rates on the date of enactment.




	 




	ASC
	740 also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Under ASC
	740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not
	to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. At November 30, 2016, there were no unrecognized tax benefits.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	The
	Company will recognize revenue in accordance with ASC No. 605, “Revenue Recognition”. ASC-605 requires that four basic
	criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred;
	(3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and
	(4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability
	of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are
	provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not
	been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has
	been delivered or no refund will be required.




	 





	Advertising
	Costs





	The
	Company’s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense
	of $0 during three month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	Management
	has reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, and does not believe any of these pronouncements
	will have a material impact on the Company.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements
	and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.




	 





	Stock-Based
	Compensation





	As
	of November 30, 2016, the Company had not issued any stock-based payments to its employees.




	 




	Stock-based
	compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable.  To date, the Company has not adopted
	a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.




	 




	NOTE
	4 – COMMON STOCK




	 




	The
	Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $ 0.001 per share.




	 




	On
	September 23, 2013, the Company issued 9,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $9,000.




	 




	For
	the year ended August 31, 2015, the Company issued 2,600,000 shares at $0.01 per share for total proceeds of $26,000.




	 




	As
	at November 30, 2016, 11,600,000 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. See Note 8 (Change of Control) regarding
	the January 8, 2016 transaction resulting in the ownership change as of approximately 77.59% of these common shares.

	NOTE
	5 – INCOME TAXES




	 




	As
	of November 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $102,477 that may be available to reduce
	future years’ taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been
	recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company
	has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.




	 




	NOTE
	6 – PREPAID EXPENSES




	 




	On
	September 15, 2016, the Company prepaid $10,000 to OTC Market Group Inc. for its annual fee from November 1, 2016 to October 31,
	2017.  $8,333 of such amount is classified as prepaid expenses as of November 30, 2016.




	 




	NOTE
	7 – LOAN FROM SHAREHOLDER




	 




	The
	Company relies on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate
	financing through sales of equity or debt securities. There is no formal written commitment for continued support from such related
	parties. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature
	and have not been formalized by a promissory note.  




	 




	From
	Inception through November 30, 2015, the Company’s then former sole shareholder and director Alexander Karpetskiy loaned
	the Company $15,066 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  The loan was non-interest bearing, due upon demand
	and unsecured. As of January 8, 2016, the amount outstanding was $14,429. As a result of the change of control described in Note
	8, the entire unpaid balance of the loan was discharged by Mr. Karpetskiy.




	 




	Since
	January 14, 2016, a current director who is also one of the Company’s major shareholders has loaned the Company $46,635
	to pay for operating expenses. As of November 30, 2016, the amount outstanding was $46,635. The loan is non-interest bearing,
	due upon demand and unsecured.  



	 



	NOTE
	8 – CHANGE OF CONTROL




	 




	On
	January 8, 2016 (the “Closing Date”), Mr. Karpetskiy entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”)
	with Hsin-Nan Lin, pursuant to which Mr. Lin acquired from Mr. Karpetskiy all 9 million shares of the Company’s common stock
	owned by him. Pursuant to the SPA, all of the Company’s outstanding liabilities as of the Closing Date, including the outstanding
	balance of Mr. Karpetskiy’s loan, were fully paid by utilizing cash on hand (or discharged in the case of Mr. Karpetskiy’s
	loan). As a result, the Company was relieved of unpaid shareholder loan in the amount of $14,428, which is recorded by the Company
	as additional paid-in capital as of November 30, 2016.




	 






	NOTE
	9 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS




	 




	In
	accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to November 30, 2016 to the date these financial
	statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial
	statements.

	ITEM
	2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION





	 





	General





	 




	We
	were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2013 under the name “Sunrise Tours, Inc.” On January 20, 2016,
	we amended our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to “Luboa Group, Inc.” in connection with our new business
	plan as described below. Our business office is located at 3 F, No. 102, Bo'ai 2nd Road, Zuoying District, Kaohsiung City, 813.
	Taiwan. Our telephone number is 886- 75570551.




	 





	Business
	Plan





	 




	Prior
	to our corporate name change on January 20, 2016, we planned to offer special service such as 3D virtual tours for companies which
	would like to promote their venues on the Internet, optical disks and hard and flash drives. Concurrent with our name change,
	we have changed our business plan to developing specialized agricultural products and a carbon emission trading platform in Asia.
	However, as of November 30, 2016, we have not entered into any definitive agreement in connection with our new business plan.




	 





	Results
	of Operations





	 




	As
	of November 30, 2016, we had total assets of $8,333 and total liabilities of $61,381.  We anticipate that we will continue
	to incur substantial losses in the next 12 months. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue
	as a going concern.  We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We may raise
	additional capital through, among other things, sale of equity or debt securities.




	 







	Three-Month
	Period Ended November 30, 2016 compared to the Three-Month Period Ended November 30, 2015







	 





	Revenue





	 




	We
	did not generate any revenue during the three months ended November 30, 2016, or the same period of 2015.




	 





	Operating
	Expenses





	 




	During
	the three-month period ended November 30, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $25,596 as compared to $7,781
	during the same period of 2015. General and administrative expenses generally relate to corporate overhead, and professional and
	administrative services such as legal, accounting and regulatory expenses.




	 





	Net
	Income (Loss)





	 




	Our
	net loss for the three-month period ended November 30, 2016 was $25,596, as compared to a net loss of $7,781 during the same period
	of 2015. 




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 







	As
	of November 30, 2016







	 




	As
	at November 30, 2016, our current assets were $8,333 as compared to $833 at August 31, 2016. As at November 30, 2016, our current
	liabilities were $61,381 as compared to $28,287 at August 31, 2016.




	 




	Stockholders’
	deficit was $53,048 as of November 30, 2016, compared $27,454 as of August 31, 2016.

	As
	of November 30, 2015







	 




	As
	at November 30, 2015, our current assets were $11,221 as compared to $18,902 at August 31, 2015. As at November 30, 2015, our
	current liabilities were $15,166 as compared to $15,066 at August 31, 2015.




	 




	Stockholders’
	deficit increased from $3,836 as of August 31, 2015, to $3,944 as of November 30, 2015.   




	 







	Cash
	Flows from Operating Activities







	 




	We
	did not generate positive cash flows from operating activities.




	 




	For
	the three months ended November 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $18,450, consisting of net loss
	of $25,596, increased by changes in prepaid expense of $7,500, and decreased by a change in accounts payable of $12,871 and accrued
	expense of $1,775.




	 




	For
	the three-month period ended November 30, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $15,860, consisting of  net
	loss of $7,781, adjusted for non-cash amortization expense of $154, increase in accounts payable of $100 and prepaid expense of
	$8,333.




	 







	Cash
	Flows from Investing Activities







	 




	Net
	cash used in investing activities during the three-month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.




	 







	Cash
	Flows from Financing Activities







	 




	We
	have financed our operations primarily from either loans from related parties or the issuance of equity and debt instruments.




	 




	For
	the three-month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $18,450 (cash proceeds
	of loans from shareholder) and $0, respectively.




	 





	Plan
	of Operations and Funding





	 




	We
	expect that our working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of related party loans and issuances
	of securities. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Our working capital requirements are expected
	to increase if and when we are able to execute on our current business plan. As of November 30, 2016, we had working capital deficit
	of $53,048.




	 




	We
	expect to fund our operations over the next three months with further loans from related parties. In connection with our business
	plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental
	expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional
	capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities
	will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior
	to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
	or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities,
	which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.




	 





	Material
	Commitments





	 




	As
	of the date of this report, we do not have any material commitments.




	 





	Purchase
	of Significant Equipment





	 




	We
	do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.




	 





	Off-balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	As
	of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
	or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
	capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	The
	independent auditors' report accompanying our August 31, 2016 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming
	that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities
	and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

	As
	a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide this information.





	 







	ITEM
	4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
	13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
	the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
	specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
	and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
	under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer
	or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	An
	evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design
	and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded
	that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed
	in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
	periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial
	reporting during the three-month period ended November 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
	affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	1.




	I
	have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of LUBOA GROUP, INC.;





	 


	 


	 















	2.




	Based
	on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material
	fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
	were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by quarterly report;





	 


	 


	 















	3.




	Based
	on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information
	included in this Report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations
	and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;





	 


	 


	 















	4.




	The
	registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining
	disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e)) and internal control
	over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f))
	for the registrant and have:





	 


	 


	 















	(a)




	designed
	such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure control and procedures
	to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant,
	including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known within those entities, particularly during the period in
	which this report is being prepared;





	 


	 


	 















	(b)




	designed
	such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial
	reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
	regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
	for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;





	 


	 


	 















	(c)




	evaluated
	the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our
	conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered
	by this report based on such evaluation;





	 


	 


	 















	(d)




	disclosed
	in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting
	that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the
	case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
	to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and





	 


	 


	 















	5.




	The
	registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
	financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
	performing the equivalent functions):





	 


	 


	 















	(a)




	all
	significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
	financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's
	ability to record, process summarize and report financial information; and





	 


	 


	 















	(b)




	any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
	internal control over financial reporting.
