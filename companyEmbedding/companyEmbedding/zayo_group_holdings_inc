  About Zayo






                                                                                                                                                                                        








Today’s world runs on bandwidth. That’s not an observation designed to impress you. It’s a fact. There are more users, more devices and more advances in data-driven services than ever before. And what does that mean? The demand for bandwidth will continue to increase.




That’s where Zayo enters the picture
Our mission is simple. We accelerate capabilities to bring freedom and prosperity to the world by providing enormous high-quality bandwidth for the world’s leading companies. These include wireless and wireline carriers, media and content providers, finance and healthcare organizations and other large enterprises. It’s been our focus since our inception in 2007. Since then, Zayo has evolved into the leading global communications infrastructure services provider, with calling cards such as high-performance connectivity, secure colocation and flexible cloud services. 























A Growing Global Network
We own and operate an 122,000-mile network in North America and Europe. This all-fiber backbone – 10 million miles of it – includes connectivity to thousands of data centers, enterprise locations, carrier exchange points, wireless towers, media centers, entertainment venues, financial exchanges and cloud providers. We offer dark fiber services, which provide our customers with dedicated high-capacity, low-latency bandwidth. In addition, Zayo’s offerings encompass a range of managed bandwidth, lit fiber solutions, including wavelength, Ethernet, IP and video transport, and our expansive network footprint and extensive metro coverage deliver bandwidth that is flexible and scalable for enterprises, carriers and government. 








                                                                                                                                                                     








Data Center Connectivity
Our 1,100+ data center connections provide you with carrier-neutral colocation space so that you can operate mission-critical communications equipment and maintain immediate access to other networks.  We offer fast access and interconnections to the most important domestic and international networks, content providers and ISPs, and interconnection providers, and our facilities implement the most advanced technology to ensure operational reliability, security, sustainability, and standards compliance. Learn more >




Grounded in the Cloud
We provide three types of cloud solutions: Dedicated, high-capacity cloud connectivity to providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS); cloud hosting through Zayo data centers; and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud services. With our IaaS services, businesses can scale their infrastructure to their growth and manage their costs through customized public, private or hybrid solutions. We also offer value-added services for additional performance, security, scalability and continuity. Customize my cloud >
