DETAILS OF THE FUND 
TECHNOLOGY FUND                                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE. The Technology Fund seeks long-term capital     
appreciation.                                                                   

HOW THE TECHNOLOGY FUND PURSUES ITS OBJECTIVE. The Technology Fund seeks
to achieve its objective by investing primarily in equity securities of         
companies that rely extensively on technology in their processes, products or   
services, or may be expected to benefit from technological advances and         
improvements in industry, manufacturing and commerce. Special emphasis may be   
given to companies employing innovative technology to enhance distribution      
systems, develop new products and increase management efficiencies. The fund    
invests in various technology subsectors, including personal computer hardware  
and software, enterprise hardware and software, data networking,                
telecommunications, Internet and electronic commerce, semiconductors,           
semiconductor equipment, computer/business services, contract manufacturing and 
component distribution.                                                         

The fund's portfolio manager will use a "bottom-up" method of analysis
based on fundamental research to select companies for the fund's portfolio. In  
selecting investments, the fund's portfolio manager will search for companies,  
regardless of size, whose stocks appear to be trading below their true value.   
The Fund also will invest in companies that are positioned for accelerated      
growth or higher earnings. The portfolio manager may sell any security in the   
fund's portfolio if the company's fundamentals deteriorate, the competitive     
landscape of the company or its industry changes, the company's position size   
in the fund's portfolio becomes too large, or new investments are more          
attractive.                                                                     

   The fund will invest, under normal market conditions, at least 65% of its
total assets in equity securities of companies that rely extensively on         
technology in their processes, products or services, or may be expected to      
benefit from technological advances and improvements in industry, manufacturing 
and commerce. Equity securities include common and preferred stocks, warrants   
or rights exercisable into common or preferred stock, securities convertible    
into common or preferred stock, and American Depository Receipts. As a          
temporary defensive measure because of market, economic or other conditions,    
the fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in high-quality, short-term debt   
instruments. To the extent that the fund invokes this strategy, its ability to  
achieve its investment objective may be affected adversely.                     

  WHAT ARE THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE TECHNOLOGY
FUND.  Perhaps the biggest risk of investing in this fund is that its returns   
will fluctuate and you could lose money. This fund invests primarily in the     
equity securities of companies whose value might decrease in response to the    
activities of the company that issued the securities, general market            
conditions, and/or economic conditions If this occurs, the fund's net asset     
value also may decrease.                                                        

    INVESTING IN A SINGLE SECTOR. The fund concentrates its investments in the
technology sector. As a result, the fund's investments likely will be sensitive 
to sector-wide conditions. Adverse conditions or developments affecting one     
technology subsector may spread to other companies within related technology    
subsectors. The market prices of companies within these subsectors may move in  
tandem, which may cause greater volatility on the fund's net asset value and    
performance than on a fund that invests among different and unrelated sectors.  

INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. Investments in technology companies
present special and significant risks. For example, if technology continues to  
advance at an accelerated rate, and the number of companies and product         
offerings continues to expand, increasingly aggressive pricing may affect the   
profitability of companies in which the fund invests. In addition, because of   
the rapid pace of technological development, products and services produced by  
companies in which the fund invests may become obsolete or have relatively      
short product cycles. As a result the fund's returns may be considerably more   
volatile than the returns of other mutual funds that do not invest in similarly 
related companies.                                                              

Prospectus 1

P-->4974th Page of 16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 4th
INVESTING IN SMALL-CAP COMPANIES. The fund may invest a portion of its
assets in small-capitalization technology companies. Small cap companies often  
have narrower markets and more limited managerial and financial resources than  
larger, more established companies. As a result, their performance can be more  
volatile and they face greater risk of business failure, which could increase   
the volatility of the fund's portfolio. Generally, the smaller the company      
size, the greater these risks.                                                  

    INTEREST RATE RISK. A rising interest rate environment tends to negatively
affect companies in the technology sector. Those technology companies having    
high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors which may cause  
sharp decreases in the companies' market prices. Further, those technology      
companies seeking to finance their expansion would have increased borrowing     
costs which may negatively impact their earnings. In addition, a rise in        
interest rates typically will cause the market value of any fixed-income        
securities held by the fund to fall. Consequently, in a rising interest rate    
environment, the fund's performance may be reduced.                             

INVESTING IN ILLIQUID SECURITIES. Because technology securities may be
volatile, there is the possbility that the technology securities in which the   
fund invests may become illiquid. Illiquid securities may trade at a discount   
when compared to more liquid investments. The fund may be unable to sell        
illiquid securities in a timely manner or at a fair price due to the lack of    
liquidity. In addition, the sale of such securities may require more time and   
increased selling expenses. Consequently, the fund's investments in illiquid    
securities may have an adverse impact on its net asset value.                   

NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISK. The fund is non-diversified which means it  
invests in a limited number of companies. Consequently, the performance of any  
one company may have a substantial impact on the fund's performance. In         
addition, the fund's net asset value may fluctuate more than a fund investing   
in a larger number of companies.                                                

  PORTFOLIO TURNOVER. The fund may engage in short-term transactions under
various market conditions to a greater extent than certain other mutual funds   
with similar investment objectives. The portfolio manager expects that the      
fund's portfolio turnover will exceed 200%. The fund's turnover rate may vary   
greatly from year to year or during periods within a year. A high rate of       
portfolio turnover generally leads to greater transaction costs and may result  
in additional tax consequences to investors.                                    

WHO IS THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER. Duane Eatherly, CFA, a Senior Research  
Analyst of the fund's subadviser Eagle Asset Management, Inc., is responsible   
for the day-to-day management of the fund.

* Heritage Asset Management, Inc. has agreed to waive its investment advisory   
fees and, if necessary, reimburse the fund to the extent that Class A annual
operating expenses exceed 1.65% of the class' average daily net assets and  
Class B and Class C annual operating expenses exceed 2.40% of that class'   
average daily net assets for the fund's 2000 fiscal year. Any reduction in  
Heritage's management fees is subject to reimbursement by the fund within   
the following two years if overall expenses fall below these percentage     
limitations.                                                                

EXPENSE EXAMPLE. This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of
investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The     
Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods        
indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The   
Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that    
the fund's operating expenses for Year 1 are net of fee waivers and/or expense  
reimbursement. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on      
these assumptions your costs would be:

MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND 

WHO MANAGES YOUR FUND 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INVESTMENT ADVISER. Heritage Asset Management, Inc. serves as the     
investment adviser and administrator for the fund. Heritage manages, supervises 
and conducts the business and administrative affairs of the fund and the other  
Heritage mutual funds with net assets totaling approximately $5.4 billion as of 
September 30, 1999. Heritage's contractual aggregate annual investment advisory 
and administration fee for the fund is 1.00% of the fund's average daily net    
assets on the first $100 million and 0.75% on average daily net assets over     
$100 million.                                                                   

Heritage is located at 880 Carillon Parkway, St. Petersburg, Florida
33716, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF), 
together with its subsidiaries, provides a wide range of financial services to  
retail and institutional clients.                                               

 SUBADVISER. Heritage may allocate and reallocate the assets of the fund
among one or more investment subadvisers, subject to review by the Board of     
Trustees. In the future, Heritage may apply to the Securities and Exchange      
Commission (SEC) to receive approval to enter into new or modified subadvisory  
agreements with existing or new subadvisers without approval of fund            
shareholders, but with the approval of the fund's Board. Upon issuance of such  
relief from the SEC, no shareholder approval would be required, subject to      
certain conditions. One of the conditions would be that the fund must send      
notice to shareholders containing information about the new subadvisor or a     
material change to an existing subadvisory contract.                            

   Heritage has selected Eagle Asset Management, Inc., 880 Carillon Parkway,
St. Petersburg, Florida 33716, to provide investment advice and portfolio       
management services to the fund's portfolio. Eagle has been managing private    
accounts since 1976 for a diverse group of clients, including individuals,      
corporations, municipalities and trusts. Eagle managed approximately $5.6       
billion for these clients as of September 30, 1999.                             

   PORTFOLIO MANAGER. Duane Eatherly, a Senior Research Analyst of Eagle, is
responsible for the day-to-day management of the fund's portfolio. From July    
1996 to May 1999, Mr. Eatherly served as a Sector Manager (Technology Equities) 
at Banc One Investment Advisors. Prior to that, he was a Vice President         
(Acquisitions) with Banc One Private Label Credit Services from November 1995   
to July 1996, and Senior Associate (Merchant Banking Group) with Banc One       
Capital Corporation from June 1993 to January 1996. Mr. Eatherly is a Chartered 
Financial Analyst and Certified Financial Planner.                              

DISTRIBUTION OF FUND SHARES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (RJA) currently serves as the distributor
of the fund. Subject to regulatory approvals, the fund's Board of Trustees has  
approved a proposed distribution agreement with Heritage Fund Distributors,     
Inc.                                                                            

YEAR 2000 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fund could be affected adversely if the computer systems used by  
Heritage, Eagle, the fund's other service providers, or companies in which the  
fund invests do not properly process and calculate information that relates to  
dates beginning on January 1, 2000 and beyond. Heritage and Eagle have taken    
steps that they believe are reasonably designed to address the potential        
failure of computer systems used by them and the fund's service providers to    
address the Year 2000 issue. However, due to the fund's reliance on various     
service providers to perform essential functions, the fund could have           
difficulty calculating its net asset value, processing orders for share sales   
and delivering account statements and other information to shareholders. There  
can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to avoid any adverse    
impact.

YOUR INVESTMENT 

BEFORE YOU INVEST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you invest in the fund, please                                 

o Read this prospectus carefully.                                     
o Next, decide which class of shares is best for you.                 
o Finally, decide how much you wish to invest and how you want to     
open an account.                                                  

CHOOSING A CLASS OF SHARES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can choose from three classes of shares: Class A shares, Class B  
shares and Class C shares. Each class has a different combination of sales      
charges and ongoing fees allowing you to choose the class that best meets your  
needs. You should make this decision carefully based on:                        

o the amount you wish to invest,                                    
o the different sales charges that apply to each share class,       
o whether you qualify for any reduction or waiver of sales charges, 
o the length of time you plan to keep the investment, and           
o the class expenses.                                               

    CLASS A SHARES. You may purchase Class A shares at the "offering price" --
a price equal to their net asset value, plus a maximum sales charge of 4.75%    
imposed at the time of purchase. Class A shares are subject to ongoing          
distribution and service (Rule 12b-1) fees of up to 0.25% of their average      
daily net assets. These fees are lower than the ongoing Rule 12b-1 fees for     
Class B shares and Class C shares.                                              

   If you choose to invest in Class A shares, you will pay a sales charge at
the time of each purchase. The table below shows the charges both as a          
percentage of offering price and as a percentage of the amount you invest. If   
you invest more, the sales charge will be lower. You may qualify for a reduced  
sales charge or the sales charge may be waived as described below.

 (1)  During certain periods, the fund's distributor may pay 100% of the
     sales charge to participating dealers. Otherwise, it will pay the
dealer concession shown above.                              
 (2)  For purchases of $1 million or more, Heritage may pay from its own
       resources to the Distributor, up to 1.00% of the purchase amount on
          the first $3 million and 0.80% on assets thereafter. If you sell these
       shares within 18 months from the date of purchase, then you will be
        subject to a 1.00% "contingent deferred" sales charge at the time of
     sale and Heritage will retain the initial year's Rule 12b-1 fees.

    CLASS B SHARES. You may purchase Class B shares at net asset value with no
initial sales charge. As a result, the entire amount of your purchase is        
invested immediately. However, if you sell the shares within 6 years of         
purchase, you will pay a "contingent deferred" sales charge (CDSC) at the time  
of sale of up to 5.00%. Class B shares are subject to ongoing Rule 12b-1 fees   
of up to 1.00% of

their average daily net assets. This Rule 12b-1 fee is higher than the ongoing  
Rule 12b-1 fees for Class A shares but the same as for the Class C shares.      
Class B shares are offered for sale only for purchases of less than $250,000.   

   If you choose to invest in Class B shares, you will pay a sales charge if
you sell those shares within 6 years of purchase. The CDSC imposed on sales of  
Class B shares will be calculated by multiplying the original purchase cost or  
the current market value of the shares being sold, whichever is less, by the    
percentage shown on the following chart. The longer you hold the shares, the    
lower the rate of the CDSC. The CDSC may be waived as described below. Any      
period of time you held Class B shares of the Heritage Cash Trust-Money Market  
Fund will not be counted when determining your CDSC.

   CONVERSION OF CLASS B SHARES. If you buy Class B shares and hold them for
8 years, we automatically will convert them to Class A shares without charge.   
Any period of time you held Class B shares of the Heritage Cash Trust-Money     
Market Fund will be excluded from the 8-year period. At this time, we also will 
convert any Class B shares that you purchased with reinvested dividends and     
other distributions. We do this to lower your investment costs.                 

 When we do the conversion, you will receive Class A shares in an amount
equal to the value of your Class B shares. However, because Class A and Class B 
shares have different prices, you may receive more or less Class A shares after 
the conversion. The dollar value will be the same, so you have not lost any     
money as a result of the conversion.                                            

    CLASS C SHARES. You may purchase Class C shares at net asset value with no
initial sales charge. As a result, the entire amount of your purchase is        
invested immediately. However, if you sell the shares less than 1 year after    
purchase, you will pay a CDSC at the time of sale of 1.00%. Class C shares are  
subject to ongoing Rule 12b-1 fees of up to 1.00% of their average daily net    
assets. This Rule 12b-1 fee is higher than the ongoing Rule 12b-1 fees for      
Class A shares and is the same as for the Class B shares. Class C shares do not 
convert to any other class of shares. Any period of time you held Class C       
shares of the Heritage Cash-Trust Money Market Fund will not be counted toward  
the 1-year period.                                                              

   If you choose to invest in Class C shares, you will pay a sales charge if
you sell your shares less than 1 year after purchase. The CDSC imposed on sales 
of Class C shares will be calculated based on the original purchase cost or the 
current market value of the shares being sold, whichever is less. The CDSC may  
be waived as described below.                                                   

UNDERSTANDING RULE 12B-1 FEES. The fund has adopted a plan under Rule 
12b-1 that allows it to pay distribution and sales fees for the sale of its     
shares and for services provided to shareholders. Because these fees are paid   
out of the fund's assets on an ongoing basis, over time these fees will         
increase the cost of your investment and may cost you more than paying other    
types of sales charges.

     accounts for purposes of calculating sales charges. Under this program, a

  Heritage mutual fund over a 13-month period and receive the same sales
  charge as if all shares had been purchased at once. You must invest at
least $25,000 to obtain the benefit of this privilege.              

  WAIVER OF CLASS A SHARES SALES CHARGE. Class A shares may be sold at net
asset value without any sales charge to: (1) Heritage and Eagle; (2) current    
and retired officers and Trustees of the fund; (3) directors, officers and      
full-time employees of Heritage, Eagle, any subadviser of a Heritage mutual     
fund, the fund's distributor and its affiliates; (4) registered financial       
advisors and employees of broker-dealers that are parties to dealer agreements  
with the fund's distributor (or financial institutions that have arrangements   
with such broker-dealers); and (5) directors, officers and full-time employees  
of banks that are party to agency agreements with the distributor, and all such 
persons' immediate relatives and their beneficial accounts. In addition,        
members of the American Psychiatric Association may purchase Class A shares at  
a sales charge equal to two-thirds of the percentages in the above table. The   
dealer concession also will be adjusted in a like manner. Class A shares also   
may be purchased without sales charges by investors who participate in certain  
broker-dealer wrap fee investment programs.                                     

Class A shares also may be sold at net asset value without any sales  
charges to individual retirement accounts, qualified retirement plans and       
taxable accounts that execute transactions through a single omnibus account     
that is maintained by a financial institution or service organization that has  
entered into an acceptable administrative or similar agreement with the         
applicable Heritage mutual fund, Heritage or the fund's distributor.            

In addition, Class A shares may be sold at net asset value without any
sales charges to participants of retirement plans which have at least 100       
participants or $50 million dollars. Heritage may pay from its own resources to 
the Distributor up to 1.00% of the purchase amount on the first $3 million and  
0.80% on assets thereafter, by these plans. Any participant in these plans who  
redeems Class A shares within 18 months of his or her purchase may be subject   
to a CDSC of 1.00% and Heritage will retain the initial year's Rule 12b-1 fees. 

CDSC WAIVERS. The CDSC for Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C 
shares currently is waived if the shares are sold:                              

o to make certain distributions from retirement plans,              

    o because of shareholder death or disability (including shareholders who
own shares in joint tenancy with a spouse),

   o to close out shareholder accounts that do not comply with the minimum
balance requirements.                                           

    REINSTATEMENT PRIVILEGE. If you sell shares of a Heritage mutual fund, you
may reinvest some or all of the sales proceeds up to 90 days later in the same  
share class of any Heritage mutual fund without incurring additional sales      
charges. If you paid a CDSC, the reinvested shares will have no holding period  
requirement. You must notify the fund if you decide to exercise this privilege. 

HOW TO INVEST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  INITIAL OFFERING OF SHARES. The fund initially will offer its shares for
sale during a period scheduled to end at the close of business on November 17,
1999. During this period, shares of the fund will be offered through RJA to     
participating dealers or banks at a price of $14.29 per Class A share           
(including the applicable sales charge) with a maximum offering price of $15.00 
per share. Class B and Class C shares will be offered at $14.29. During this    
period, a financial advisor of RJA, participating dealers, or participating     
banks may receive payments for any orders. These persons may benefit from the   
temporary use of funds received prior to close of the initial offering period.  
After the close, the fund will commence investment operations. The fund may     
withdraw, cancel or modify the offering of shares during the initial offering   
period without notice or refuse any order in whole or in part, if the fund      
determines that it is in its best interests to do so.                           

  MINIMUM INITIAL INVESTMENT. Once you have chosen a share class, the next
step is to determine the amount you wish to invest. The minimum initial         
investment for the fund is:

HOW TO SELL YOUR SHARES. You may contact your financial advisor or    
Heritage with instructions to sell your investment in the following ways:       

THROUGH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. You may sell your shares through your 
financial advisor who can prepare the necessary documentation. Your financial   
advisor will transmit your request to sell shares of the fund and may charge    
you a fee for this service.                                                     

BY TELEPHONE. You may sell shares from your account by telephone by   
calling the fund at (800) 421-4184 prior to the close of regular trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange -- typically 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. If you do not wish 
to have telephone redemption privileges, you must complete the appropriate      
section of the account application.                                             

BY MAIL. You may sell shares of the fund by sending a letter of       
instruction. Specify the fund's name, your share class, your account number,    
the names in which the account is registered and the dollar value or number of  
shares you wish to sell. Include all signatures and any additional documents    
that may be required. Mail the request to Heritage Asset Management, Inc., P.O. 
Box 33022, St. Petersburg, FL 33733.                                            

Some circumstances require a written letter requesting sale of shares,
along with a signature guarantee. These include:                                

  o Sales from any account that has had an address change in the past 30
days                                                            

o Sales of greater than $50,000                                     

o Sales in which payment is to be sent to an address other than the 
address of record                                               

 o Sales in which payment is to be made to payees other than the exact
registration of the account or                                  

     o Exchanges or transfers into other Heritage accounts that have different
titles                                                          

    We will only accept official signature guarantees from participants in our
signature guarantee program, which includes most banks and security dealers. A  
notary public can not guarantee your signature.                                 

BY SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PLAN. This plan may be used for periodic     
withdrawals from your account. To establish, complete the appropriate section   
of the account application or the Heritage systematic withdrawal form           
(available from your financial advisor or Heritage) and send that form to       
Heritage. Availability of this plan may be limited by your financial advisor.   
You should consider the following factors when establishing a plan:             

o Make sure you have a sufficient amount of shares in your account. 

     o Determine how much you wish to withdraw. You must withdraw a minimum of
$50 for each transaction.                                       

 o Make sure you are not planning to invest more money in this account
      (buying shares during a period when you also are selling shares of the
same fund is not advantageous to you, because of sales charges).

     o Determine the schedule: monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual basis.

      o Determine which day of the month you would like the withdrawal to occur.
        Available dates are the 1st, 5th, 10th or 20th day of the month. If such
       a date falls on the weekend, the withdrawal will take place on the next
business day.                                                   

o Heritage reserves the right to cancel systematic withdrawals if   
     insufficient shares are available for two or more consecutive months.

    RECEIVING PAYMENT. When you sell shares, payment of the proceeds generally
will be made the next business day after your order is received. If you sell    
shares that were recently purchased by check or pre-authorized automatic        
purchase, payment will be delayed until we verify that those funds have         
cleared, which may take up to two weeks. You may receive payment of your sales  
proceeds the following ways:                                                    

o BY CHECK -- We will mail a check to the address of record or bank 
     account specified on your account application. Checks made payable to
     other than the registered owners or sent to an address other than the
        address of record require written instruction accompanied by a signature
guarantee, as described above.                                  

      o BY WIRE -- You may request that we send your proceeds by Federal Reserve
        wire to a bank account you specify. You must provide wiring instructions
     to Heritage in writing. We normally will send these proceeds the next
day. A $5.00 wire fee will be charged to your account.          

    o TO YOUR BROKERAGE ACCOUNT -- If you place your redemption request with
 your financial advisor, payment can be directed to your brokerage
      account. Payment for these trades occurs three business days after you
place your sale request.                                        

HOW TO EXCHANGE YOUR SHARES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you own shares of the fund for at least 30 days, you can exchange those  
shares for shares of the same class of any other Heritage mutual fund provided  
you satisfy the minimum investment requirements. You may exchange your shares   
by calling your financial advisor or Heritage if you exchange to like titled    
Heritage accounts. Written instructions with a signature guarantee, as          
described above, are required if the accounts are not identically registered.   

You may make exchanges without paying any additional sales charges.   
However, if you exchange shares of the Heritage Cash Trust-Money Market Fund    
acquired by purchase (rather than exchange) for shares of another Heritage      
mutual fund, you must pay the applicable sales charge.                          

    Class B and Class C shares will continue to age from the original date and
will retain the same CDSC rate as they had before the exchange. However, if you 
hold Class B shares or Class C shares in the Heritage Cash Trust--Money Market  
Fund, the time you hold those shares in that fund will not be counted for       
purposes of calculating the CDSC.                                               

ACCOUNT AND TRANSACTION POLICIES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    PRICE OF SHARES. The fund's regular business days are the same as those of
the New York Stock Exchange, normally Monday through Friday. The net asset      
value per share (NAV) for each class of the fund is determined each business    
day at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (typically   
4:00 p.m., Eastern time). The share price is calculated by dividing a class's   
net assets by the number of its outstanding shares. Because the value of the    
fund's investment portfolio changes every business day, the NAV usually changes 
as well.                                                                        

In calculating NAV, the fund typically prices its securities by using 
pricing services or market quotations. However, in cases where these are        
unavailable or when the portfolio manager believes that subsequent events have  
rendered them unreliable, the fund may use fair-value estimates instead. In     
addition, the fund may invest in securities that are primarily listed on        
foreign exchanges that trade on weekends and other days when the fund does not  
price its shares. As a result, the NAV of the fund's shares may change on days  
when shareholders will not be able to purchase or redeem the fund's shares.     

TELEPHONE TRANSACTIONS. For your protection, telephone requests may be
recorded in order to verify their accuracy. In addition, we will take measures  
to verify the identity of the caller, such as                                   

Prospectus 11

asking for name, account number, Social Security or other taxpayer ID number    
and other relevant information. If appropriate measures are taken, we are not   
responsible for any losses that may occur to any account due to an unauthorized 
telephone call. Also for your protection, telephone redemptions are not         
permitted on accounts whose name or addresses have changed within the past 30   
days. Proceeds from telephone transactions can only be mailed to the address of 
record.                                                                         

 TIMING OF ORDERS. All orders to purchase or sell shares are executed at
the next NAV calculated after the order has been received in good order. Orders 
are accepted until the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange  
every business day -- normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time -- and are executed the  
same day at that day's NAV. Otherwise, all orders will be executed at the NAV   
determined as of the close of regular trading on the next trading day.          

   RESTRICTIONS ON ORDERS. The fund and its distributor reserve the right to
reject any purchase order and to suspend the offering of fund shares for a      
period of time. There are certain times when you may not be able to sell shares 
of the fund or when we may delay paying you the proceeds. This may happen       
during unusual market conditions or emergencies or when the fund cannot         
determine the value of its assets or sell its holdings.                         

    REDEMPTION IN KIND. We reserve the right to give you securities instead of
cash when you sell shares of the fund. If the amount of the sale is at least    
either $250,000 or 1% of the fund's assets, we may give you securities from the 
fund's portfolio instead of cash.                                               

   ACCOUNTS WITH BELOW-MINIMUM BALANCES. If your account balance falls below
$500 as a result of selling shares (and not because of performance or sales     
charges), the fund reserves the right to request that you buy more shares or    
close your account. If your account balance is still below the minimum 60 days  
after notification, the fund reserves the right to close your account and send  
the proceeds to your address of record.                                         

DIVIDENDS, CAPITAL GAINS AND TAXES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES. The fund distributes to its shareholders     
dividends from its net investment income annually. Net investment income        
generally consists of interest income and dividends received on investments,    
less expenses. The dividends you receive from the fund will be taxed as         
ordinary income.                                                                

  The fund also distributes net capital gains to its shareholders normally
once a year. Capital gains are generated by the fund when it sells assets in    
its portfolio for profit. Capital gains are taxed differently depending on how  
long the fund held the asset. Distributions of net gains recognized on the sale 
of assets held for one year or less are taxed as ordinary income; distributions 
of net gains recognized on the sale of assets held longer than that (long-term  
capital gains) are taxed at lower capital gains rates.                          

 Fund distributions of dividends and net capital gains are automatically
reinvested in fund shares at NAV (without sales charge) unless you opt to take  
your distributions in cash, in the form of a check or direct them for purchase  
of shares in another Heritage mutual fund. However, if you have a retirement    
plan or a Systematic Withdrawal Plan, your distributions will be automatically  
reinvested in fund shares.

In general, selling or exchanging shares and receiving distributions  
(whether reinvested or taken in cash) are all taxable events. These             
transactions typically create the following tax liabilities for taxable         
accounts:

Dividend distributions will vary by class and are anticipated to be   
generally higher for Class A shares.                                            

    TAX REPORTING. If you are a non-retirement account holder, then each year,
we will send you a Form 1099 that tells you the amount of fund distributions    
you received for the prior calendar year, the tax status of those               
distributions, and a list of reportable sale transactions. Generally, fund      
distributions are taxable to you in the year you receive them. However, any     
distributions that are declared in October, November or December but paid in    
January generally are taxable as if received on December 31 of the year they    
are declared.                                                                   

WITHHOLDING TAXES. If you are a non-corporate shareholder and the fund
does not have your correct social security or other taxpayer identification     
number, federal law requires us to withhold 31% of the distributions and sale   
proceeds payable to you. If you are otherwise subject to backup withholding, we 
also are required to withhold and pay to the IRS 31% of your distributions. Any 
tax withheld may be applied against the tax liability on your tax return.       

Because everyone's tax situation is unique, always consult your tax   
professional about federal, state and local tax consequences.
