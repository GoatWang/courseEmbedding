George Edward Vonderhaar, 89, passed away Saturday, February 9, 2013 at Hospice of Cincinnati in Blue Ash. Born February 19, 1923 to George August and Emma Nostheide Vonderhaar, George attended St. Aloysius Gonzaga School and Elder High School. After graduation in 1941 he went to work for Aluminum Industries. Inducted into the army in early 1943, he served in North Africa and Sicily, then went ashore on the first day of the allied invasion at Anzio, Italy in January 1944. After the war George attended Xavier University and following graduation began a long career with Cherry-Burrell Corporation, a manufacturer of processing equipment for the dairy, food and beverage industries. In 1950 George married Rita Margaret Osborne and together they had five children. In addition to his work as a field sales engineer, George and his brother Norbert developed several subdivisions in western Hamilton County. Predeceased by his beloved wife Rita in 2012 and earlier by his brother Norbert and sisters Clare Vonderhaar and Vera Bateman, George is survived by his daughter Diane Skierkiewicz and sons Mark, Tom (Nancy), Chris (Carol) and George (Jill) Vonderhaar, as well as by thirteen grandchildren: Lee, Dan and Sara Skierkiewicz and Kate, Bob, Liz, Meg, Anna, Joe, Kelly, Eric, Alex and Johnathan Vonderhaar. Additional survivors include his sister-in-law Mary Osborne, his brother-in-law Ronald Hertel, his niece Cathy Borgemenke and her family, and many cousins. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 11:30 am on Thursday, February 14, at Our Lady of the Visitation Church, South Road where George's volunteer service in many roles spanned more than five decades. Visitation will be in the church reception area starting at 10:00 am. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Elder High School, Cincinnati Right to Life Educational Foundation, or to a charity of your choice.
