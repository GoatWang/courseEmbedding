At Aspiriant, we’ve institutionalized caring.

Loved.

Powerful.
Your financial plan is as meticulous as they come. Every decision moves you closer to realizing your grand vision.

Richer.
It’s nice to have a wealth management firm with accounting roots. A tax-conscious strategy is a beautiful thing.

Brainy.
Our investment acumen becomes your investment acumen. The best brains in the business craft your investment strategy.

Far-sighted.

Our services are organized into
 three boxes.
You won’t fit neatly
 into any of them.





Come to Aspiriant if you want true customization and personalization, drawing on an immense range of services. The specific blend is dictated 100-percent by you.
Every client gets institutional-grade investment management, masterminded by our deep in-house research team. From there, we add some of the most meticulous and invigorating financial planning you can find, performed by your own dedicated team of caring specialists. There’s much more, if and when you need it: tax management, estate planning, philanthropy. The list goes on and on.
Our services fall into three broad categories:
Investing
 Investing & Wealth Planning
 Family Office
It’s likely you’ll use something from each of these. The situation is fluid. What we do for you evolves as you and your life evolve. But the underlying structure and support you receive remain constant. That’s real wealth management.

Aspiriant is the leading independent wealth management firm in the United States.
Our firm draws upon deep roots within the wealth management industry. Aspiriant was formed in 2008 when two highly regarded firms, Kochis Fitz (San Francisco, founded in 1991) and Quintile Wealth Management (Los Angeles, founded in 2002), combined to provide a full suite of sophisticated, integrated wealth management services.
Aspiriant is 100% owned by our key employees.
Our ownership structure, unlike many other wealth management firms, ensures Aspiriant’s stability and independence for future generations. As an employee-owned firm, Aspiriant is unmoved by the winds shaking many of the nation’s banks and brokerages.
Aspiriant is committed to providing investment solutions and personal wealth strategies to help our clients achieve their aspirations.
Our firm’s mission is to enhance the quality of our clients’ lives by creating and implementing personal wealth strategies and managing clients’ investment portfolios to meet their own unique, individual goals.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
