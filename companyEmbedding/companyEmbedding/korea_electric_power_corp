History[edit]




Korea's first electric light being turned on at Gyeongbokgung in 1887


KEPCO traces its origins to Hanseong Jeongi Hoesa (Seoul Electric Company), founded in 1898 during the Joseon Dynasty.[9] The announcement of the Chosun Electricity Control Decree by the Colonial Korean government in March 1943 saw the integration of several electric companies into the Korea Electric Power Company. The Korea Electric Company (KECO), established through the integration of the Korea Electric Power Company and two distribution companies, Gyeongsung Electric Company and South Korea Electric Company, opened on July 1, 1961. In 1982, KECO became a wholly government owned entity and was renamed the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO).[10]
KEPCO was listed on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) on August 10, 1989 and later in 1994 on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1996, KEPCO was named the prime contractor for the multinational Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) project to construct a light water reactor nuclear power plant in North Korea,[11] a project which was eventually abandoned in 2006.[12] Following a push by the Korean government to restructure Korea's power industry which began in the mid-1990s, the Act on the Promotion of Restructuring the Electric Power Industry was proclaimed on December 23, 2000,[13] after which the electricity generation business was split up into Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, a subsidiary responsible for nuclear & hydro power generation, and five thermal power generation companies: Korea South-East Power, Korea Midland Power, Korea Western Power, Korea Southern Power, and Korea East-West Power.
In October 2012, Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation sold its 3.6% of its stake in KEPCO for a fee of around $550 million.[14]
Subsidiaries[edit]
KEPCO comprises six power generation companies and four subsidiaries in related business areas. It also owns a stake in four affiliated companies.[15]
Power generation companies[edit]

Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP): operates 21 nuclear power plants and 27 hydropower plants in Korea which account for 18,265 MW in total capacity (as of Dec. 2010).
Korea South-East Power (KOSEP): with 8,976 MW in total capacity (as of Dec. 2010), KOSEP operates the Samcheonpo Thermal Power Site Division and the Yeongheung Thermal Power Plant.
Korea Midland Power (KOMIPO): operates the Boryeong Thermalelectric Power Plant Site Division and the Yeongheung Thermal Power Plant, and possesses 9,399 MW in total installed capacity (as of Dec. 2010).
Korea Western Power: operates the Taean Thermal Power Plant and manages a total installed capacity of 9,604 MW via 8 soft coal-fired units, 24 LNG combined cycle units, 4 oil-fired units and 4 pumped storage power plant units.
Korea Southern Power (KOSPO): operates the Hadong Thermal Power Site Division and manages 9,638 MW in total installed capacity as of Dec. 2010.
Korea East-West Power: operates the Dangjin and Honam Coal Fired Power Plants, and manages a total of 9,510 MW in installed capacity as of Dec. 2010.





List of KEPCO subsidiaries

Operations[edit]
Domestic activities[edit]
In Korea, KEPCO primarily provides electricity to include industrial, commercial, residential, educational and agricultural customers. As of December 31, 2011, KEPCO had a total installed generating capacity of 67,001MW produced by 503 generation units including nuclear, oil, coal, liquified natural gas, hydro, wind and solar sources. The length of KEPCO's transmission lines stood at 31,249 circuit kilometers as of end-2011.[16][17][18]
Nuclear business[edit]
See also: Nuclear power in South Korea
KEPCO's involvement in the nuclear energy sector ranges from design and engineering of the nuclear power plant to nuclear fuel, commissioning and operation, maintenance and decommissioning. Construction of KEPCO nuclear power plants is undertaken by major Korean construction companies, while the manufacture of key elements of a nuclear power plant is done by companies including Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction and Westinghouse Electric Company. In 2009, KEPCO won a bid to construct four units of the APR1400 reactor in the United Arab Emirates.[19]
In October 2013 a vice-president of KEPCO, amongst about 100 people, was indicted for falsifying safety documents.[20]
In 2017 KEPCO showed interest in taking a stake in the Moorside development in the UK. [21]
Overseas activities[edit]




KEPCO's Malaya thermal power plant in the Philippines


KEPCO's overseas forays started in 1993 when the company was awarded a technical consulting contract for maintenance on the Guangdong nuclear power plant in China. At present, KEPCO is involved in projects in 13 countries around the world.[22] In 1996, KEPCO entered the Philippines power market when it was awarded the contract for the refurbishment and operation of the Malaya thermal power plant. In 1996, KEPCO won the bid to construct the Ilijan gas-fired combined cycle power plant, a 1,200MW build-operate-transfer project. Today, KEPCO operates four power plants in the Philippines, including the Naga Power Plant Complex and the Cebu Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion Power Plant, while the company's operations account for 12% of the country's installed generation capacity.[15] In April 2012 KEPCO contracted ICPO to raise $400m to buy into Boutique Coal in Australia to benefit from cheap coal briquettes which improved burn efficiency by up to 30% reduced SO
x and NO
x by >80% and reduced CO
2. KEPCO scientists tried to get IP details and reverse engineer the product for their own use. BC cancelled all association with KEPCO due to an attempt to circumvent and declared KEPCO less than reputable.




KEPCO wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China


In the area of transmission and distribution consultation, KEPCO has undertaken projects in Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Libya, Ukraine, Paraguay and Egypt.[23] KEPCO entered the wind power industry in China with its involvement in the Gansu wind project, on which the first stage of construction began in 2007. KEPCO also holds an equity share in wind projects in Inner Mongolia and Riaoning, as well as in China's Shanxi Province. In 2010, a KEPCO-led consortium including Samsung C&T and Korean firm Techint was awarded a contract to build and operate the Norte II combined cycle gas power plant in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.[24] In 2005, KEPCO began supplying electricity to the Kaesong Industrial Region in North Korea.[25]
Resources development[edit]
In order to raise its fuel self-sufficiency rate to 60% by 2020,[26] in 2010, KEPCO acquired the Bylong Coal Mine in Australia from Anglo American PLC.[27] Also in 2010, KEPCO bought a 20% stake in Bayan Resources in Indonesia, thus allowing the company to raise its coal self-sufficiency rate by 7 million tons annually from 2015.[28] In 2009, KEPCO bought a 1.5% stake in Indonesia's Adaro Energy, thus securing 3 million tons of coal annually.[29] Regarding uranium procurement, in 2009, KEPCO acquired a 17% share of Denison Mines Corp. in Canada, as well as a 10% stake in Areva SA's Imouraren uranium mine in Niger. In 2010, KEPCO signed an agreement with Areva to jointly develop uranium mines.[30]
Smart grid[edit]
In early 2010, KEPCO announced it would invest over US$7 billion in its smart grid business by 2030 to make electricity distribution more efficient and decrease Korea's greenhouse gas emissions.[31] KEPCO is one of the 168 Korean and foreign companies taking part in the Jeju Smart Grid Demonstration Project, begun following the announcement of Korea's National Smart Grid Roadmap in 2009.[32] In June 2011, it was announced that KEPCO would collaborate with IBM to build a Total Operations Center at the Jeju Smart Grid Test-Bed Demonstration Complex.[33]

History[edit]




Korea's first electric light being turned on at Gyeongbokgung in 1887


KEPCO traces its origins to Hanseong Jeongi Hoesa (Seoul Electric Company), founded in 1898 during the Joseon Dynasty.[9] The announcement of the Chosun Electricity Control Decree by the Colonial Korean government in March 1943 saw the integration of several electric companies into the Korea Electric Power Company. The Korea Electric Company (KECO), established through the integration of the Korea Electric Power Company and two distribution companies, Gyeongsung Electric Company and South Korea Electric Company, opened on July 1, 1961. In 1982, KECO became a wholly government owned entity and was renamed the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO).[10]
KEPCO was listed on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) on August 10, 1989 and later in 1994 on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1996, KEPCO was named the prime contractor for the multinational Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) project to construct a light water reactor nuclear power plant in North Korea,[11] a project which was eventually abandoned in 2006.[12] Following a push by the Korean government to restructure Korea's power industry which began in the mid-1990s, the Act on the Promotion of Restructuring the Electric Power Industry was proclaimed on December 23, 2000,[13] after which the electricity generation business was split up into Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, a subsidiary responsible for nuclear & hydro power generation, and five thermal power generation companies: Korea South-East Power, Korea Midland Power, Korea Western Power, Korea Southern Power, and Korea East-West Power.
In October 2012, Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation sold its 3.6% of its stake in KEPCO for a fee of around $550 million.[14]
Subsidiaries[edit]
KEPCO comprises six power generation companies and four subsidiaries in related business areas. It also owns a stake in four affiliated companies.[15]
Power generation companies[edit]

Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP): operates 21 nuclear power plants and 27 hydropower plants in Korea which account for 18,265 MW in total capacity (as of Dec. 2010).
Korea South-East Power (KOSEP): with 8,976 MW in total capacity (as of Dec. 2010), KOSEP operates the Samcheonpo Thermal Power Site Division and the Yeongheung Thermal Power Plant.
Korea Midland Power (KOMIPO): operates the Boryeong Thermalelectric Power Plant Site Division and the Yeongheung Thermal Power Plant, and possesses 9,399 MW in total installed capacity (as of Dec. 2010).
Korea Western Power: operates the Taean Thermal Power Plant and manages a total installed capacity of 9,604 MW via 8 soft coal-fired units, 24 LNG combined cycle units, 4 oil-fired units and 4 pumped storage power plant units.
Korea Southern Power (KOSPO): operates the Hadong Thermal Power Site Division and manages 9,638 MW in total installed capacity as of Dec. 2010.

Operations[edit]
Domestic activities[edit]
In Korea, KEPCO primarily provides electricity to include industrial, commercial, residential, educational and agricultural customers. As of December 31, 2011, KEPCO had a total installed generating capacity of 67,001MW produced by 503 generation units including nuclear, oil, coal, liquified natural gas, hydro, wind and solar sources. The length of KEPCO's transmission lines stood at 31,249 circuit kilometers as of end-2011.[16][17][18]
Nuclear business[edit]
See also: Nuclear power in South Korea
KEPCO's involvement in the nuclear energy sector ranges from design and engineering of the nuclear power plant to nuclear fuel, commissioning and operation, maintenance and decommissioning. Construction of KEPCO nuclear power plants is undertaken by major Korean construction companies, while the manufacture of key elements of a nuclear power plant is done by companies including Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction and Westinghouse Electric Company. In 2009, KEPCO won a bid to construct four units of the APR1400 reactor in the United Arab Emirates.[19]
In October 2013 a vice-president of KEPCO, amongst about 100 people, was indicted for falsifying safety documents.[20]
In 2017 KEPCO showed interest in taking a stake in the Moorside development in the UK. [21]
Overseas activities[edit]




KEPCO's Malaya thermal power plant in the Philippines


KEPCO's overseas forays started in 1993 when the company was awarded a technical consulting contract for maintenance on the Guangdong nuclear power plant in China. At present, KEPCO is involved in projects in 13 countries around the world.[22] In 1996, KEPCO entered the Philippines power market when it was awarded the contract for the refurbishment and operation of the Malaya thermal power plant. In 1996, KEPCO won the bid to construct the Ilijan gas-fired combined cycle power plant, a 1,200MW build-operate-transfer project. Today, KEPCO operates four power plants in the Philippines, including the Naga Power Plant Complex and the Cebu Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion Power Plant, while the company's operations account for 12% of the country's installed generation capacity.[15] In April 2012 KEPCO contracted ICPO to raise $400m to buy into Boutique Coal in Australia to benefit from cheap coal briquettes which improved burn efficiency by up to 30% reduced SO
x and NO
x by >80% and reduced CO
2. KEPCO scientists tried to get IP details and reverse engineer the product for their own use. BC cancelled all association with KEPCO due to an attempt to circumvent and declared KEPCO less than reputable.




KEPCO wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China


In the area of transmission and distribution consultation, KEPCO has undertaken projects in Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Libya, Ukraine, Paraguay and Egypt.[23] KEPCO entered the wind power industry in China with its involvement in the Gansu wind project, on which the first stage of construction began in 2007. KEPCO also holds an equity share in wind projects in Inner Mongolia and Riaoning, as well as in China's Shanxi Province. In 2010, a KEPCO-led consortium including Samsung C&T and Korean firm Techint was awarded a contract to build and operate the Norte II combined cycle gas power plant in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.[24] In 2005, KEPCO began supplying electricity to the Kaesong Industrial Region in North Korea.[25]
Resources development[edit]
In order to raise its fuel self-sufficiency rate to 60% by 2020,[26] in 2010, KEPCO acquired the Bylong Coal Mine in Australia from Anglo American PLC.[27] Also in 2010, KEPCO bought a 20% stake in Bayan Resources in Indonesia, thus allowing the company to raise its coal self-sufficiency rate by 7 million tons annually from 2015.[28] In 2009, KEPCO bought a 1.5% stake in Indonesia's Adaro Energy, thus securing 3 million tons of coal annually.[29] Regarding uranium procurement, in 2009, KEPCO acquired a 17% share of Denison Mines Corp. in Canada, as well as a 10% stake in Areva SA's Imouraren uranium mine in Niger. In 2010, KEPCO signed an agreement with Areva to jointly develop uranium mines.[30]

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

History[edit]




Korea's first electric light being turned on at Gyeongbokgung in 1887


KEPCO traces its origins to Hanseong Jeongi Hoesa (Seoul Electric Company), founded in 1898 during the Joseon Dynasty.[9] The announcement of the Chosun Electricity Control Decree by the Colonial Korean government in March 1943 saw the integration of several electric companies into the Korea Electric Power Company. The Korea Electric Company (KECO), established through the integration of the Korea Electric Power Company and two distribution companies, Gyeongsung Electric Company and South Korea Electric Company, opened on July 1, 1961. In 1982, KECO became a wholly government owned entity and was renamed the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO).[10]
KEPCO was listed on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) on August 10, 1989 and later in 1994 on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1996, KEPCO was named the prime contractor for the multinational Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) project to construct a light water reactor nuclear power plant in North Korea,[11] a project which was eventually abandoned in 2006.[12] Following a push by the Korean government to restructure Korea's power industry which began in the mid-1990s, the Act on the Promotion of Restructuring the Electric Power Industry was proclaimed on December 23, 2000,[13] after which the electricity generation business was split up into Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, a subsidiary responsible for nuclear & hydro power generation, and five thermal power generation companies: Korea South-East Power, Korea Midland Power, Korea Western Power, Korea Southern Power, and Korea East-West Power.
In October 2012, Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation sold its 3.6% of its stake in KEPCO for a fee of around $550 million.[14]
Subsidiaries[edit]
KEPCO comprises six power generation companies and four subsidiaries in related business areas. It also owns a stake in four affiliated companies.[15]
Power generation companies[edit]

Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP): operates 21 nuclear power plants and 27 hydropower plants in Korea which account for 18,265 MW in total capacity (as of Dec. 2010).
Korea South-East Power (KOSEP): with 8,976 MW in total capacity (as of Dec. 2010), KOSEP operates the Samcheonpo Thermal Power Site Division and the Yeongheung Thermal Power Plant.
Korea Midland Power (KOMIPO): operates the Boryeong Thermalelectric Power Plant Site Division and the Yeongheung Thermal Power Plant, and possesses 9,399 MW in total installed capacity (as of Dec. 2010).
Korea Western Power: operates the Taean Thermal Power Plant and manages a total installed capacity of 9,604 MW via 8 soft coal-fired units, 24 LNG combined cycle units, 4 oil-fired units and 4 pumped storage power plant units.
Korea Southern Power (KOSPO): operates the Hadong Thermal Power Site Division and manages 9,638 MW in total installed capacity as of Dec. 2010.
Korea East-West Power: operates the Dangjin and Honam Coal Fired Power Plants, and manages a total of 9,510 MW in installed capacity as of Dec. 2010.

Domestic activities[edit]
In Korea, KEPCO primarily provides electricity to include industrial, commercial, residential, educational and agricultural customers. As of December 31, 2011, KEPCO had a total installed generating capacity of 67,001MW produced by 503 generation units including nuclear, oil, coal, liquified natural gas, hydro, wind and solar sources. The length of KEPCO's transmission lines stood at 31,249 circuit kilometers as of end-2011.[16][17][18]
Nuclear business[edit]
See also: Nuclear power in South Korea
KEPCO's involvement in the nuclear energy sector ranges from design and engineering of the nuclear power plant to nuclear fuel, commissioning and operation, maintenance and decommissioning. Construction of KEPCO nuclear power plants is undertaken by major Korean construction companies, while the manufacture of key elements of a nuclear power plant is done by companies including Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction and Westinghouse Electric Company. In 2009, KEPCO won a bid to construct four units of the APR1400 reactor in the United Arab Emirates.[19]
In October 2013 a vice-president of KEPCO, amongst about 100 people, was indicted for falsifying safety documents.[20]
In 2017 KEPCO showed interest in taking a stake in the Moorside development in the UK. [21]
Overseas activities[edit]




KEPCO's Malaya thermal power plant in the Philippines


KEPCO's overseas forays started in 1993 when the company was awarded a technical consulting contract for maintenance on the Guangdong nuclear power plant in China. At present, KEPCO is involved in projects in 13 countries around the world.[22] In 1996, KEPCO entered the Philippines power market when it was awarded the contract for the refurbishment and operation of the Malaya thermal power plant. In 1996, KEPCO won the bid to construct the Ilijan gas-fired combined cycle power plant, a 1,200MW build-operate-transfer project. Today, KEPCO operates four power plants in the Philippines, including the Naga Power Plant Complex and the Cebu Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion Power Plant, while the company's operations account for 12% of the country's installed generation capacity.[15] In April 2012 KEPCO contracted ICPO to raise $400m to buy into Boutique Coal in Australia to benefit from cheap coal briquettes which improved burn efficiency by up to 30% reduced SO
x and NO
x by >80% and reduced CO
2. KEPCO scientists tried to get IP details and reverse engineer the product for their own use. BC cancelled all association with KEPCO due to an attempt to circumvent and declared KEPCO less than reputable.




KEPCO wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China


In the area of transmission and distribution consultation, KEPCO has undertaken projects in Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Libya, Ukraine, Paraguay and Egypt.[23] KEPCO entered the wind power industry in China with its involvement in the Gansu wind project, on which the first stage of construction began in 2007. KEPCO also holds an equity share in wind projects in Inner Mongolia and Riaoning, as well as in China's Shanxi Province. In 2010, a KEPCO-led consortium including Samsung C&T and Korean firm Techint was awarded a contract to build and operate the Norte II combined cycle gas power plant in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.[24] In 2005, KEPCO began supplying electricity to the Kaesong Industrial Region in North Korea.[25]
Resources development[edit]
In order to raise its fuel self-sufficiency rate to 60% by 2020,[26] in 2010, KEPCO acquired the Bylong Coal Mine in Australia from Anglo American PLC.[27] Also in 2010, KEPCO bought a 20% stake in Bayan Resources in Indonesia, thus allowing the company to raise its coal self-sufficiency rate by 7 million tons annually from 2015.[28] In 2009, KEPCO bought a 1.5% stake in Indonesia's Adaro Energy, thus securing 3 million tons of coal annually.[29] Regarding uranium procurement, in 2009, KEPCO acquired a 17% share of Denison Mines Corp. in Canada, as well as a 10% stake in Areva SA's Imouraren uranium mine in Niger. In 2010, KEPCO signed an agreement with Areva to jointly develop uranium mines.[30]
Smart grid[edit]
In early 2010, KEPCO announced it would invest over US$7 billion in its smart grid business by 2030 to make electricity distribution more efficient and decrease Korea's greenhouse gas emissions.[31] KEPCO is one of the 168 Korean and foreign companies taking part in the Jeju Smart Grid Demonstration Project, begun following the announcement of Korea's National Smart Grid Roadmap in 2009.[32] In June 2011, it was announced that KEPCO would collaborate with IBM to build a Total Operations Center at the Jeju Smart Grid Test-Bed Demonstration Complex.[33]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  5.04 (07/28/17)      EPS (TTM)  $3.97      Market Cap $26.07 B     Shares Outstanding 1.28 B     Public Float N/A     Yield KEP has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.97      Net Money Flow ($)  -35,959    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
