WE SENSE THE WORLD
Our leading technology platform ‘Common Sense’ connects smartphones and other wearables to a sensor cloud. With our intelligent algorithms, we transform the raw sensor data into real time human and environmental behavior measurements. And through our smart coaching engine we empower people to change.

Meet Sense Labs

Sense Labs is a research and teaching environment dedicated to advanced knowledge about how sensor data can be used to empower people. Recognizing earthquakes, managing emergencies, improving healthy lifestyles, supporting mental health; they all have one fundamental thing in common: they benefit from personal context awareness, created from the smartphones and wearable sensors we are all carrying with us nowadays. We support users and their social network by providing real-time context awareness. And with us, their privacy always comes first.

Common Sense

We create personal context awareness through the usage of our unique sensor data processing platform ‘Common Sense’. We measure your sleep, social interaction, physical activity, travel time and top locations … and so much more. For this platform, we developed a unique and leading technology for real-time processing of large amounts of sensor data. Interpreting this data with intelligent algorithms and behavioral science makes this unrivaled, powerful technology.

Sense - Home Energy Monitor
































We make things that matter.
We are happiest creating products for people’s everyday lives. The only thing better is working with a great group of people. Luckily, we get to do both.
Sense was born from the simple idea that people should know what’s happening in their homes. We track calories, footsteps, miles per gallon, budgets, and rewards points — yet it’s astonishing that we know so little about the place where we spend so much time. Energy efficiency and home automation begin with information. We built the Sense home energy monitor to provide people with information about their homes in the simplest, most useful way possible.
We are deeply data, mobile, and consumer-oriented. We brought advanced speech recognition technology to mobile phones including voice search, voice text messaging and dictation, and voice-enabled virtual assistant technology. Our products are used globally in Samsung and other mobile phones and in Siri before its acquisition.
Now we’re putting all our energy into helping you better understand yours.

Sense Listens
Every electrical device has a unique electronic signature — its own voice. The Sense home energy monitor listens to those voices through current sensors in your electric panel. It records them millions of times per second. Then advanced machine learning detection algorithms work to distinguish one appliance from another — to recognize each individual voice.
