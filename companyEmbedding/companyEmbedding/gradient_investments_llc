August Economic Slowdown?September 8, 2016At Gradient Investments we monitor the fundamentals of the market continually. To review, we believe that long-term stock prices are driven by 3 broad fundamental metrics, they are:

The health of the economyThe profitability of the companies operating within the economyMarket and individual stock price valuations
Today let’s do a quick review of the economy. One of the broadest measures of the economy is Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP has been growing at a moderate (and fairly stable) pace the last five years. The chart below illustrates how the US economy has been growing between 1% and 3% on an annual basis.

 

Recently the GDP growth rate has slowed down closer to the 1% range. This is concerning if the growth rate doesn’t accelerate. A reading over 2% is much more indicative of a healthier economy. Let’s break down our economy into two broad sectors.

First, the manufacturing sector of the economy has been dwindling over time, but is still important and comprises roughly 12% of the US economy. Every month the “Institute for Supply Management”, or ISM, reports a PMI index which highlights economic activity in the manufacturing sector. A reading above 50% indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding, below 50% indicates that it is generally contracting. In August the PMI came in at 49.4% down from 52.6% in July. The chart below highlights that the manufacturing PMI has not been below 50% (the border between expansion and contraction) since February of 2016.

 

Secondly, we need to look at ISM’s PMI index for the all-important services sector of our economy.  The US service sector slowed to a six-year low in August, according to ISM. The PMI index on the service sector came in at 51.4% for August, down from 55.5% in July. That’s still growth, but it’s the lowest reading since February 2010, when the index pulled out of contractionary territory for good following the 2008 financial crisis. See the chart below highlighting service sector PMI readings.

 

The August slowdowns in both the manufacturing and services sector of the economy point to a potential anemic GDP growth rate again in the 3rd quarter of 2016. In fact, Chris Williamson (Chief economist of Markit) says “taken together, the manufacturing and services PMIs are pointing to an annualized GDP growth rate of a mere 1%, suggesting that those looking for a strengthening in the rate of economic growth will be disappointed once again".

Monthly data can be volatile, especially during the summer. But we’ll certainly be keeping an eye on upcoming economic reports to determine if the August slowdown was an outlier or a trend.

Proprietary Portfolio Pilot Report
Charting a desired flight plan with the proprietary Portfolio Pilot report is a process of thoroughly analyzing an investor's current investments and desired individual risk tolerance and making appropriate recommendations based on their investment goals. The report is designed to illustrate an investor's current portfolio risk and reward ratio relative to the risk and reward ratio within the appropriate Gradient Investments' portfolio.
The report is based on personalized information and backed by independent, third-party data. Navigating through retirement is similar to flying in inclement weather. Charting an investment flight plan with the Portfolio Pilot can enable an investor to avoid turbulence by plotting their desired flight plan and seeking the greatest return for the least amount of risk. The Portfolio Pilot is intended to provide only broad hypothetical guidelines and information about current and proposed investment strategies.

Market Commentary
Investing can be a challenging yet rewarding process. Information changes rapidly which is why it is so important to stay informed. Please enjoy our latest market commentary.


Second Quarter Market ReviewJuly 5, 2017 | Print ViewThe beat goes on.  The first quarter set the tone for the market, the second quarter carried out the now familiar tune.  The stock market hits new record highs only to be followed by more record levels.  This should be a euphoric time for investors where bull markets typically end in tragedy.  Instead, investors remain overly cautious expecting something disastrous at any moment.  The longer investor nervousness continues, the longer this bull market will run.

The economic data fully supports the bull market.  The political and social headlines are successfully distracting investors from what really matters; corporate earnings.  The stock market is celebrating a strong first quarter of corporate earnings and earnings estimates for the second quarter look even better.  Add to this; low unemployment rates, stable interest rates, benign inflation and most of all a healthy consumer and we have a recipe for record breaking days on Wall Street.

Stock returns were positive around the globe in the second quarter as emerging markets and international developed stocks outperformed U.S. stocks.  International markets are in the midst of a solid run, offsetting some recently troubled years.  A recent acceleration in overseas economic growth and compelling valuations is being reflected in international stock prices.  The U.S. market had been riding the technology wave through early June when the tide turned for a brief moment.  Growth stocks are crushing value stock investing in the first half of the year. Energy has been the primary laggard as oil prices found their way to the low end of a recent $40-$60 a barrel range.

A widely anticipated Federal Reserve rate hike came as advertised after their mid-June meeting.  The Federal Reserve is on a quarterly mission to raise short-term interest rates and return to a normal monetary policy.  The Fed funds target rate now sits at 1.00-1.25%.  In addition to adjusting monetary policy, the Fed also must reduce their inflated balance sheet by selling trillions of bonds they purchased during the multiple post financial crisis quantitative easing programs.  This process will begin later this year and will take years to unwind.  Expect relative stability in bonds as rates remain low, but inch higher over time.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury finished the quarter with a 2.29% yield after reaching a low yield for the year of 2.12% in June. The yield curve continues to flatten as the short end reacts to the Fed rate hikes and the long end celebrates low inflation. Credit spreads are locked in at the tightest levels of the year thanks to the strong equity market and a healthy risk appetite from investors.  Investment grade spreads and high yield spreads remain very tight, helping these sectors outperform the overall bond market.

Interest rates are low, stock prices are high and this scenario will likely continue well into the third quarter.  Stock prices will be supported by a new round of earning releases which comes on the heels of the best earnings quarter since 2011.  Expect more good news on this front.  With credit spreads tight and interest rates low don’t expect too much from bonds in the second half of 2017.  The first half of the year has exceeded our fixed income return expectations, so flat returns in the second half would be a win.  Stocks should continue to ride high on the corporate earnings train.

Earnings Season – This Is What We’re WatchingJuly 20, 2017 | Print ViewAs the stock markets reach new all-time highs, publicly traded companies are just beginning to report sales and earnings for the second quarter of 2017.  Over the next couple of weeks we will be watching for a number of data points within the earnings reports, along with management commentary around their businesses.

We have been seeing year-over-year earnings growth accelerate over the past several quarters for the broad market index, the S&P 500. In fact, S&P earnings were in decline for four quarters (mid 2015 to mid-2016), with the drop attributed to just one sector, energy. For the first quarter of 2017, we saw earnings growth of 14%; we expect 10% growth in the second quarter. We currently expect earnings growth to accelerate in the second half of this year, providing a strong foundation for the stock market. Looking further out, consensus earnings growth of nearly 12% is expected for 2018, according to FactSet, as seen in the chart below:
Source: FactSet Earnings Insight as of July 14, 2017

A company’s earnings growth is not the only driver of a stock’s price, however. In fact, a study by McKinsey & Co. showed that a 1% beat had virtually no impact of the price of a company stock five days after the earnings announcement.* Often, companies will guide analysts’ expectations down prior to the quarterly report in an effort to create a beat…managing expectations, some might say. More important, we believe, is the quality of earnings and management’s outlook versus current expectations.

We look for sales and earnings growth from core operations, not boosted by one-time events or shifts from one quarter to the next. We want to see expanding operating margins, not an earnings benefit from a one-time item such as a lower tax rate. Investors should be encouraged by management’s discussion of rising orders or new technology that will grow the business over the longer term. Is the sector showing greater growth characteristics than most have expected?  Management sentiment around improved operating efficiencies or a more suitable capital structure are other positive factors that can drive stock prices higher.

Yes, a series of disappointments will impact the price of a stock over time. The disappointments would create distrust in management’s ability to accomplish their goals. Similarly a pattern of significantly exceeding expectations will lead to stock price outperformance. 

However, a single disappointment, if accompanied by an improved short and/or long term outlook can result in positive stock price performance.  We believe we are in a period of rising earnings, which tends to be positive for stock prices. Stay tuned.

The tactical investment process identifies broad geographic investment markets (and their sub-sectors) where price momentum is greatest. In significant and sustained down markets throughout the world the GTR can deploy a catastrophic cash call and move 100% to cash. The investment team utilizes a quantitative, two-factor approach in its tactical investment process and deploys a proven methodology that selects the most optimal global asset class sectors.  The GTR is actively managed to maximize risk-adjusted return over full market cycles.

Gradient 33
The Gradient 33 stock portfolio holds approximately 33 individual securities. These are companies that are growing at rates much faster than the market averages. Our rigorous selection process focuses on long-term growth metrics, specifically sales and earnings per share growth. The G33 screening algorithms rank companies who have shown historical growth trends, but more importantly are projected to consistently experience above-average increases in sales and earnings in the future. We balance these 33 stock selections between the small, mid and large capitalization sectors of the market. Doing so gives the portfolio exposure to proven growth companies while participating in the emerging winners of tomorrow.
Secular growth companies have innovative business models. They provide unique, high demand products and services to the markets that propel this growth and can change the way business is done. Investors wishing to participate in this growth seek outsized gains while understanding the inherent risks that accompany this style of investing. The 33 securities are continuously screened and monitored by our team of CFAs.

The Gradient 40i
The Gradient 40i (G40i) is an actively managed portfolio consisting of 40 equally weighted, international, blue chip, dividend paying stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs).  The G40i utilizes a disciplined process to select international stocks based upon fundamental strength, valuation, and the company’s ability to pay and grow their dividends.  Our investment team actively manages the G40i portfolio and stocks will be sold if the company no longer meets the investment criteria or a superior investment opportunity is identified.

Gradient Endowment Series
The most successful investors are not who you think they are! If you ask people who the most successful investors are, you get responses like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway; John Neff, formerly of Vanguard's Windsor Fund; or George Soros, the famous hedge fund operator. However, some of the most successful investors from a risk/reward perspective are the large university endowment funds. This group includes universities with endowments larger than $1 billion such as Yale University and Harvard University.
Large endowment funds have consistently beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis. These funds diversify away from traditional asset classes, like stocks and bonds, by investing in lesser known asset classes, such as currency, private equity, commodities, and absolute return strategies. These lesser known asset classes have the capability to deliver profits over a business cycle. The same opportunities are now available to individual investors via low-cost, publicly-traded ETFs within our Endowment Series.

Gradient Laddered Income
One of the most effective investment strategies available to fund future cash flow needs is to build a bond ladder. The Gradient Laddered Income strategy is constructed by purchasing diverse fixed income instruments that mature at regular intervals from three to seven years out. After the nearest security matures the proceeds are reinvested into a new year or they are spent to cover planned expenditures. The fundamental investment theme behind a bond ladder is diversification by maturity. It also curbs reinvestment risk as the portfolio produces a steady stream of cash flow.
Maturity specific ETFs and other liquid investment vehicles are now available to the individual investor allowing for liquidity, low-cost and diversification all within a particular maturity year. The Gradient Laddered Income strategy is a unique, custom portfolio combining the best of bond mutual funds and individual bonds to create yield and immediate cash flow.

Gradient Covered Call
The Covered Call Portfolio uses ETFs as the underlying investment vehicle. The allocation is unique in that the ETFs used are approximately 60 percent growth, 20 percent bond and 20 percent inverse to the stock market. We then actively manage a monthly covered call strategy on the underlying ETFs to generate additional cash flow and reduce investment risk.
The Covered Call Portfolio complements an existing fixed income strategy while focusing on conservative risk adjusted returns. The inverse position provides a natural hedge against the market's movements and, therefore, reduces overall risk and provides downside protection.
The Covered Call Portfolio is an ideal solution for the client looking for an income-producing portfolio with upside potential and downside protection.

Gradient Absolute Yield
The Gradient Absolute Yield Portfolio invests globally for high current income.  This is a diverse portfolio with the flexibility to seek out the asset classes providing the most attractive yields in the global marketplace.  Gradient Investments employs a broad based approach to identify high yielding securities across multiple asset classes.  As a multi-asset portfolio it can freely move between high yield bonds, equities, emerging market debt, master limited partnerships, preferred stocks, senior bank loans and other investments to access global income.
The Gradient Investment team seeks the most attractive asset valuations to insure high income, and broad diversification to lower portfolio volatility.  
The Gradient Absolute Yield Portfolio solves a major dilemma many investors face today – how to generate meaningful income in a low interest rate environment?   Traditional sources of income such as certificates of deposit, savings accounts or bonds no longer keep pace with inflation.  This globally diverse portfolio goes beyond traditional fixed income classes and is keenly focused on generating high current income.
Absolute Yield Flyer

Gradient Fixed Income Series
Fixed income assets are often misunderstood, but at Gradient, we understand the complexities of investing in bonds. Our fixed income portfolios are carefully designed for long-term investors seeking current income through a diversified approach.
The main goal of the fixed income program is to provide investors with current income and relative price stability by building diversified portfolios across all fixed income sectors. Our investment strategy uses a bottom-up fundamental research approach to identify solid fixed income investment opportunities producing a reliable income stream with relative price stability.

Gradient Precious Metals
Historically, precious metals such as platinum, silver, and gold have been a source of stability and an extremely effective tool in uncertain economic times. Owning a diversified portfolio of precious metals as a part of an overall investment strategy can act as a hedge against market turmoil. There are numerous ways to purchase and own precious metals, and owning a portfolio of exchange traded funds (ETF) and no load mutual funds provides several distinct advantages over the physical possession of these metals. Such advantages include diversification, liquidity and pricing, and custody. Additionally, owning a portfolio ETFs and no load mutual funds allows for investing in precious metals in retirement accounts.

Solid PTO and health care benefits. All development is purely internal and well planned which allows for little to no extra hours work.ConsThe biggest con is no work from home options. However, management has implemented many perks to improve the on-site environment. Because the development environment is young, mistakes can be made as the team learns together. But I would also consider this a pro because we have the opportunity to control our own processes and try different options.Advice to ManagementPut more trust in employees by allowing some work from home options.

Excellent customer service is its number one priority which is exemplified in its rapid growth and success. Because of this growth, there are countless opportunities for employment. Gradient is owned by a husband and wife team who are focused on family. A foundation of family is prevalent throughout, as many employees are referrals from other family members, friends and neighbors. Full-time positions offer full benefits and options for a 401K plan. PTO is generous. Compensation is in line with state averages. There are fun internal events planned each month to keep up employee morale.Most of all, I am proud to work for a company that started out in a garage with 12 people and is now at approximately 200 employees. Even with that many employees, I still feel like my voice is heard, that my opinion matters and that I have the opportunity to contribute to this company's success.ConsGradient is experiencing amazing growth; with that kind of success there are always 'growing pains' in which employees take on heavy workloads until additional support is hired and training can sometimes be lacking. In addition, some jobs are still handled internally where eventually they may need to be outsourced. So far Gradient is ahead of the game and is handling its growth positively.Advice to ManagementTreat your employees like they make a difference and they will.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Gradient Financial Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Gradient Financial Group 2015-02-23 10:35 PST Dec 15, 2014 Helpful (1)"This is a good company that treats its employees well."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookProsWorking as a developer, there is great autonomy, little to no micromanagement, and a friendly and helpful team.ConsThe high level vision can be a little murky, though it is improvingShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Gradient Financial Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Gradient Financial Group 2014-12-15 22:20 PST Showing 15 of 16 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12NextReviews > Gradient Financial Group RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to Explore Company BenefitsDoctor's valiseThere are currently no benefit reviews for this company.Add Benefits Review Job Seekers Also ViewedGradient ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 8 ReviewsGradient Analytics ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 3 ReviewsPNC Financial Services Group ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 3,620 ReviewsDeutsche Bank ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 3,424 ReviewsThe Blackstone Group ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 128 ReviewsEdward Jones ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,828 Reviews Related Job SearchAnalyst jobsAnalyst salaries ($67k)Vice President jobsVice President salaries ($148k)Associate jobsAssociate salaries ($92k)Investment Banking Analyst jobsInvestment Banking Analyst salaries ($77k)Intern jobsIntern salaries ($33k)Financial Advisor jobsFinancial Advisor salaries ($47k)Summer Analyst jobsSummer Analyst salaries ($51k)Financial Analyst jobsFinancial Analyst salaries ($63k)Managing Director jobsManaging Director salaries ($183k)Teller jobsTeller salaries ($24k)Software Engineer jobsSoftware Engineer salaries ($84k)Director jobsDirector salaries ($137k)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.
