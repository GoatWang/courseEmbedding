Who We Are - Energy Solutions Consortium

































































 

Energy for the next 100 years. 

















The key team members of Energy Solutions have a long working relationship, having focused on numerous successful brownfield developments and other challenging projects in various capacities.
Most recently, the Energy Solutions team members developed a large combined cycle plant in the PJM Interconnection (Moundsville Power 565 MW), taking the project from concept to a fully permitted status in under 20 months.
Energy Solutions leverages the unique skills of its members across multiple disciplines (power and gas markets, environmental, construction management, finance, and tax structure) to deliver efficient and effective solutions to complex projects. Energy Solutions believes in maximizing value by reducing development timelines through detailed risk mitigation practices and site selection due diligence processes
