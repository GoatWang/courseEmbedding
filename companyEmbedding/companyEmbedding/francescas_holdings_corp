(NASDAQ:FRAN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Francesca's Holdings Corporation: A Hidden Gem In RetailJul. 7.17 | About: Francesca's Holdings (FRAN) John N. Lenz Contrarian, long/short equity, long-term horizon, Deep ValueLinkedInSummaryGrowth story still intact.Company making strategic investments including a shift towards e-commerce distribution.Earnings and margin concerns more than priced in.Valuation looks favorable and shares are undervalued.Investment Thesis Francesca's Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:FRAN) is a boutique retail chain selling apparel, jewelry, accessories, and gift items. In recent quarters, the company’s stock has taken a significant hit due to margin deterioration. Persistent negative sentiment and price action surrounding the stock due to margin pressures have been overdone. Despite the firm’s recent margin pressures, Francesca's still boasts higher margins and better financial and operational performance than its peers. At this point, the firm’s margin pressures are likely fully reflected in its stock price; however, its growing e-commerce division is being overlooked in terms of valuation. With e-commerce beginning to pick up speed and valuation pricing in significant downside of the shares, I suggest the firm is an attractive pick with an asymmetrical payoff profile. I therefore recommend a buy on Francesca’s Holdings Corporation with a target price of $13.40. Company and Business Model Overview Primary Operating Segments (2016 Breakdown): 1. Apparel - 49% 2. Jewelry - 23% 3. Accessories - 15% 4. Gifts - 13% Francesca’s Holdings Corporation, an operator of boutiques, sells apparel, jewelry, gifts, and accessories primarily designed for teens and young women between the ages of 18 and 35 years old. In 2016, Francesca’s managed to grow overall top-line sales at a 13% growth rate despite a tough retail environment. Most of the firm’s top-line growth originates from its investment in growing its base of existing boutique stores. This growth was despite year/year declines in overall foot traffic. Francesca’s Holdings Corporation continues to grow its base of existing boutique stores at a rate of approximately 10% per year. The company funds this expansion internally out of its operating cash flows, recouping its original investment in new boutiques within 14 months. Moreover, the firm continues to grow by transitioning a portion of its business to e-commerce in order to diversify its revenue streams as well as counteract the decreases in foot traffic that have afflicted the entire retail segment. The e-commerce portion of the business has experienced substantial growth in recent years, growing from less than 1% to about 5% of the firm’s sales over the last five years. In 2016, Francesca’s grew its overall e-commerce online business by 42% year/year, and the firm’s e-commerce business now represents approximately 5% of its net sales for 2016.
 Superior Same-Store Sales Growth Relative to Peers The stock's current valuation indicates a worst case scenario of declining same-store sales growth. The firm's same-store sales growth, while flat, has been superior to its peers due to the company's corporate strategy of maintaining limited quantities of a broad assortment of merchandise. It does this by regularly making smaller more frequent vendor shipments than peers. This strategy helps the firm to effectively compete with other retail establishments by consistently bringing new merchandise into the store. This strategy has a few benefits. Firstly, it creates a more personalized and fresh shopping experience which translates into improved customer service and increased store traffic as customers check stores more often when they see new merchandise. While shopping, customers are more likely to make impulse purchases, thus increasing average transactions relative to peers. The strategy also has the associated benefit of managing the risk of inventory obsolescence by maintaining limited quantities of a wide assortment of brands. The firm therefore benefits from the availability of a wide assortment of products without the associated risk of too much inventory. Despite flat same-store sales growth, the firm's current expansion can still be justified on the basis of increased economies of scale and improvements in purchasing power. While I cannot say for sure that same-store sales growth will not go negative, I can confidently state that same-store sales growth has been superior to other industry peers, and I believe the firm's "broad and narrow" inventory strategy provides the necessary competitive advantage to maintain this edge going forward. Earnings and Margin concerns are Overblown The prevailing negative sentiment and price action surrounding the stock appear to be due to higher selling, general, and administration expenses, and lackluster same-store sales growth similar to other industry peers. Although the firm’s gross and operating margins have deteriorated in the recent year, margins appear to be stabilizing with margins mostly flat over the recent year. Furthermore, despite the deterioration in the firm’s gross and operating margins, the firm still boasts margins superior to its overall industry peer group. While same-store sales growth has been flat, revenues have grown at a rate of approximately 10% per year due to expansions in the company’s base of boutiques. Francesca’s Holdings Corporation currently operates a base of 671 stores with a long-term goal of opening a total of 900 boutique stores across the country. Given the firm’s goal of expanding its store base to 900, growth in new boutique openings is likely to trail off as the company approaches its goal. I believe the firm’s rapidly growing e-commerce divisions will replace this source of revenue growth, a view that is bolstered by the firm’s continued reinvestment of cash flows into this burgeoning division. At this point, earnings and margin concerns are more than priced into the stock price. Moreover, the company’s management is returning capital to its shareholder via share buybacks, shrinking its share count in the most recent year by approximately 10%. This indicates management’s confidence in that its shares are undervalued and better days lay ahead for the firm.
 E-Commerce will Drive Future Growth Opportunities Francesca’s Holdings Corporation has grown its e-commerce portion of the business at about a 30% compounded annual growth the last few years, and e-commerce now represent 5% of all sales. Furthermore, while management does not disclose the average transaction amount, the firm indicates in its 2017 Quarter 1 conference call, that average transactions are substantially greater for the e-commerce portion of the business than for brick and mortar boutique stores. Management plans to grow its e-commerce penetration as a percentage of revenue to the low to mid-teens in the next 4-5 years. While this certainly seems like a lofty goal, the firm’s own marketing research has shown a lack of awareness of its e-commerce distribution system by its existing customer base. Management is currently undertaking an advertising and promotional campaign to increase awareness of the online distribution system by the existing customer base. This indicates significant room to improve market penetration of the e-commerce business and thereby drive future growth opportunities once new boutique openings have slowed. Solid Financial and Operating Performance   Performance Metric 2016 2015 2014 2013   Asset Turnover 2.57 2.27 2.28 2.26   Gross Margin 46.93% 47.73% 47.04% 51.73%   Operating Margin 13.94% 14.18% 13.98% 21.82%   Net Margin 8.62% 8.68% 8.51% 13.18%   Return on Assets 22.15% 19.71% 19.40% 29.78%   The company generates a high return on equity, making up the lower margins attributable to the industry and market structure through the use of superior asset efficiency. The company’s lack of leverage improves the firm’s ability to continue its growth with lower risk. Despite the recent weakness in retail, the firm has continued to generate outstanding returns on equity in excess of 20%. This is predominantly due to the firm’s ability to effectively manage its assets, given its commendable total asset turnover of 2.5X. The firm’s "broad but shallow" merchandising strategy continues to pay off with exceptional inventory turnover. Francesca’s Holdings Corporation maintains limited quantities of a broad assortment of products, helping the company to manage markdowns and inventory obsolescence risks related to the fashion and retail environment while benefiting from the brand’s perception of exclusivity. This strategy also has the associated benefit of constantly bringing new merchandise into the store, which drives foot traffic and increases brand loyalty.
 Additionally, management is currently conducting market research in preparation of the release of a new customer loyalty program which should further boost brand loyalty and enable an expansion in margins. Looking forward, I expect asset and inventory turnover to be bolstered by recent investments in an inventory ordering system. The new inventory system should reduce lead time, allowing Francesca’s to turn its inventory and assets even more efficiently, and thereby continue to boost its return on equity. Moreover, the firm has managed to retain respectable margins, superior to its peer group, even in the wake of continuing retail weakness. I expect margins to continue to remain flat; however, I cannot rule out the possibility of additional margin deterioration should industry conditions worsen. In the long term, the firm may not possess a significant amount of operational leverage but it likely has the ability to demand lower rental prices, and possibly reduced vendor prices as it continues to scale. Once the existing leases expire, Francesca’s Holdings Corporation and all its new boutiques will likely be able to renew these leases and benefit from more favorable rental prices due to being an anchor tenant. On the other hand, a worsening retail environment could also adversely affect margins due to competitive pressures and increased merchandise markdowns. The firm’s ability to finance its operations without the use of any debt significantly reduces downside risk in this scenario by improving the firm’s operating flexibility given the weak retail environment. Valuation Bear Case In the bear case, a declining retail environment will inhibit the firm from generating a return on capital necessary to cover its cost of capital. In this event, the firm is likely to begin becoming an income investment stock as companies that are unable to generate an economic profit are best served returning capital to their shareholders through buybacks and dividends. The firm’s current strategy of executing a significant buyback program bears this out. If the firm becomes a dividend paying stock, the firm is likely to pay out approximately 70-75% of its earnings to its shareholders since reinvestment into the business would no longer be economically feasible. The valuation of the business would then be equal to the firm’s dividends paid out plus the firm’s value of net cash. I also believe it to be a fair assumption for the firm to be able to grow its dividends and sales at a rate of 2% as greater cost efficiencies occur. Traditionally, as sales growth begins to slow for firms, companies begin to cut costs to create a leaner operating structure; I believe the firm can maintain consistent 2% increases in average selling prices (in line with expense and inflation growth) given its strong brand loyalty. Furthermore, I believe the firm also has the ability to drive some cost efficiencies in its operating structure by reducing marketing costs and reducing pay for performance and sales commissions for example. A no-growth version of the business will not have to spend money on these costs and therefore opportunities exist for driving greater cost efficiencies. We can value this no-growth valuation of the firm as the value of its future dividends using the Gordon Growth model PLUS the amount of net cash per share for shareholders.
   Dividend Discount Model Components Model Assumptions and Outputs   Dividend Payout Ratio 75%   Earnings/Share $1.00   WACC 11.8%   Growth Rate of Dividends 2%   No-Growth Value of the business $7.65   Net Cash available per share $1.42   Downside Valuation $9.07   Implied Downside Risk -13.8%     CAPM Components CAPM Assumptions   Estimated Risk-Free Rate 2.2%   5 year Beta 1.20   Market Risk Premium(Historical) 8%   Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 11.8%   The Most Likely Case In the most likely case, I believe the firm will continue to grow its sales in line with its historical compounded annual growth rate and margins will likely remain flat. Furthermore, I also believe that the although same-store sales growth will continue to be flat, the firm’s continued investment in its e-commerce distribution channel will pay dividends as e-commerce sales become a more meaningful portion of the business. Investors have not priced in any growth from the e-commerce shift, but as e-commerce continues to grow as a proportion of sales, I believe the visibility of this e-commerce division will improve and investors eventually will price this with a significantly higher multiple. The fact that market research indicates limited awareness of the e-commerce channel by the company’s existing customer base bolsters my confidence in management’s online strategic initiatives. The company currently sells for a bargain price of 7.84X 2016 free cash flow, along with the a free cash flow yield of approximately 14%. One of the firm’s primary competitors, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), which sells its own private brands and operates within the accessories and apparel lines of business, sells at 10.2X its 2016 free cash flow. Despite selling at a premium to Francesca’s Holdings Corporation, Nordstrom lags the firm in both its margins and returns on assets. Furthermore, its overall peer group sells at an industry median of 9.36X 2016 free cash flows, and as shown below, Francesca’s Holdings Corporation is clearly a superior performer to its peer group and thus should sell at a premium to its industry. Given this, I believe that once investors notice the emerging e-commerce business and it becomes a more meaningful portion of the firm’s revenue over the next few years, the market will re-rate the stock and a comparable 10X free cash flow multiple would be a quite reasonable valuation. Assuming no growth in the firm’s free cash flows, applying a conservative 10x free cash flow multiple to the stock, on par with the multiple of its peer group, yields a price target of $13.40, indicating a margin of safety and a 28% upside potential. This implied multiple likely understates actual upside potential due to its lack of inclusion of any growth in free cash flows as the firm’s rate of new store openings trails off.

If management is able to execute its strategic goals and navigate a successful shift towards a bigger e-commerce division, the market will eventually notice and significant upside potential exists. If I am wrong and the firm’s expansion into e-commerce falters, I believe the stock has more than priced in the downside risk since even if the firm is unable to grow further and becomes a dividend paying stock, its current valuation implies a 13.8% downside. This is balanced against an upside potential of approximately 28% in the event of a modest re-rating of valuation. The risk-reward potential of this investment opportunity of slightly more than 2:1 displays an asymmetric payoff to this investment for individuals with a longer-term time horizon. I therefore re-iterate my price target of $13.40, and recommend a buy given the asymmetrical risk of the investment opportunity.

	Francesca’s Holdings Corp (FRAN) Shares Fall to 11-Month Low on Earnings Miss and Lower Guidance
FRAN offered the familiar refrain of retailers this earnings season -- late Easter, slower mall traffic -- as explanation for down results

Francesca’s Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:FRAN) missed fiscal Q1 profit and sales expectations and gave investors little to be hopeful for in management’s outlook. FRAN stock is down almost 15% this morning in premarket trading.

Net profit for the three months ending April 29 fell to $4.3 million, or 12 cents a share, versus $7.1 million, or 18 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. The EPS consensus was 14 cents. Sales eked out a 1% increase to $107.7 million from $106.1 million, but short of a consensus of $113.2 million. Improved sales in April failed to compensate for weak numbers in February and March. Same-store sales declined 5%, driven by a decline in boutique traffic and conversion rates. Estimates were for only a 0.5% decline.
Houston, Texas-based Francesca’s caters to 18-35 year-old fashion conscious, female customers. In what has become a familiar refrain during the current earnings season in the retailing sector, management pointed to the one-two punch of lower traffic and a later Easter this year.
“We were disappointed in our comparable sales performance, which was impacted by lower than expected boutique traffic and conversion rate,” Steve Lawrence, president and CEO, said in a company press release. “February and March sales were soft, primarily as a result of the later Easter, driving weaker than anticipated sales in full-price product. In spite of lower sales, our first quarter diluted EPS came in at the low end of our guidance due to better than expected merchandise margins and cost management. Since the beginning of April, sales trends have improved with the onset of warmer weather and the Easter shift.”
As  John Jagerson, editor of SlingShot Trader, wrote here last week, “Investors care about retail spending because most of U.S. gross domestic product is derived through consumption. Consumer spending is a measure of economic health and corporate profits. A decline in the growth rate of consumer spending (or even a contraction) is a precursor to recessions. For those reasons, the declines in some big retail stocks has put traders on edge this quarter.”
Sales are now expected to be in a range of $120 million to $124 million for fiscal Q2, compared to a consensus forecast of $126.2 million, while same-store sales guidance in a range of down 3% to up 1% compares with a consensus of up 1.5%. Francesca’s expects to open approximately 60 to 65 stores and close approximately 10 to 15 in fiscal year 2017, compared to 64 new locations opened and nine closed in fiscal year 2016.
FRAN stock had already lost 33% of its value this year as of yesterday’s market close. Shares have not been this low since early July 2016. Peers have fared worse, with Express, Inc. (NYSE:EXPR) down 39% and Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN) down 35% in the same period.

Francesca's Holdings - An Attractive Long In A Depressed Industry - Francesca's Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:FRAN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Francesca's Holdings - An Attractive Long In A Depressed IndustryApr.21.17 | About: Francesca's Holdings (FRAN) Kenra Investors Value, long-term horizon, research analyst, contrarianMarketplaceConsumer AlphaSummaryThe apparel industry in the United States has not performed very well in the last 1-2 years.Francesca's holdings is one of the few exceptions, reporting solid growth on all fronts.At less than 14 times earnings, the stock is a good long.Francesca's Holdings (NASDAQ:FRAN) is one of the few apparel retailers that has been able to report solid growth numbers in the last 2 years. The company operates a flexible business model based on relatively small boutiques and a fast growing commerce website. Growth is not expected to fade away soon and balance sheet is strong. At less than 14 times earnings, I think the stock is an attractive long. 

 Business Overview Francesca's holdings is a specialty retailer that operates a chain of boutiques across the United States. As of January 28 (most recent available data), the company operates 671 boutiques in 48 states and the district of Columbia, through which it offers a mix of apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts, mainly targeted towards women between the ages of 18-35. Francesca's holdings also operates a fast-growing e-commerce business, through its website www.francescas.com. Although their business model is nothing particularly unique or innovative, the company is not the usual apparel retailer. The company's stores range in size from 1,000 to 2,000 square feet, with an average size of 1,391 square feet, much less than standard specialty retailers. Nonetheless, Francesca's stores tend to have more flexible formats, with the aim of securing highly visible locations in malls, street locations, lifestyle centers, strip centers and outlet centers. The company tries to make each store feel like an independently owned boutique rather than a homogeneous chain. Moreover, each store carries a relatively limited number of items and brings new items often (5 days a week, according to management) to create a feeling of scarcity and uniqueness of the goods it sells and to keep the shopping experience fresh and interesting. These stores primarily offer a unique assortment which primarily consists of exclusive items under the company's proprietary brands, with the addition of a small selection of a few nationally-recognized brands in some categories.
 An Exception in the retail space The business model is simple, the growth model is even simpler. Francesca's growth model largely depends on the opening of new boutiques each year and on growth in the e-commerce channel. So far, it's working pretty well. Revenue has grown for years, although with some volatility in the growth rate, supported by rising comps, growth in the e-commerce business and an increasing number of boutiques. Even in the recent quarters, which have been characterized by an extremely weak retail environment, the company has continued to report positive growth. Francesca's has been one of the few apparel retailers reporting positive revenue growth and comps in 2016, although comps were flat in Q4. 

 FRAN data by YCharts This retailer has held up well in a difficult 2016 (and 2015, in part) delivering positive revenue growth and flat comps even in its worst quarter, while many retailers were dealing with significant declines, sometimes in excess of 5%. When we analyze the state of retail and apparel retail in particular, Francesca's seems to be a nice exception in a depressed industry. It's not easy to indicate a reason behind the relative strength. Probably the company has positioned itself on the right side of current fashion trends, or maybe their continuous renewal in offerings has created a nice shopping experience that customers like to repeat. It could also be that their flexible store format let them exploit a variety of geographies with different characteristics and demographic trends. Nonetheless, 50% of their boutiques are located in malls, so they were not immune to the effects of declining foot traffic in that segment. The relative strength is surely due to a combination of factors, but what's interesting for me is the fact that the company can attract consumers and the brand is gaining popularity. How do I know it? Besides the clear expansion shown in reported numbers, our friend Google Trends helps us - as we can see in the chart, the interest for "Francesca's" is booming.
 

 Valuation What multiple would you give the stock of a growing company that has been one of the few good performers in a depressed industry? If your answer is something like "a multiple that implies a premium over the worse performing peers" I totally agree with you. Although the market doesn't. Comparing FRAN to similar stocks in the apparel industry, it's strange to see that it's relatively easy to trade at a premium over FRAN, even for companies with lower margins and revenue growth. Revenue growth and margins: 

 FRAN Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts Price to Earnings multiples: 

 FRAN PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts I also find it strange that the stock can trade at a P/E multiple below 14, while the median for the industry is more than 50% higher, at 21. I think there is not much to justify the difference. Even if we assume that the market is giving a premium to bigger companies due to their scale advantage or brand power, I think this is still a low valuation for a growing company in this market. Takeaway and Risks Francesca's holdings is a nice company. They have a flexible business model and very good margins and growth, compared to the rest of the industry. The stock is trading at an attractive valuation, considering the company's performance. The company's growth is being driven by three main positive trends - a growing number of stores, a growing e-commerce business and rising comps. Only comps have slowed down in the last few quarters, while e-commerce growth has accelerated and the number of boutiques keeps rising. Store count has grown at a 16.84% CAGR in the last 4 years, and management expects a 7.4% increase in 2017 (50 more boutiques). E-commerce is growing in excess of 40%, while comps were flat in Q4, but are not expected to decline. For 2017, Francesca's management expects a 8% to 12% revenue increase over last year, and a 9% EPS growth, from $1.11 to $1.21. If growth doesn't fall short of expectations, the current price is an interesting entry point.
 The risks of this investment are basically the same of any apparel/fashion stock. The company operates in a fragmented and competitive market, which is subject to changing trends that may occasionally help or threaten one company or another. An import tax under the current government could harm the business profitability but, besides that, I don't see particularly high risks. The company has a solid balance sheet and its biggest supplier accounts for just 6% of the products sold. I am long with a 1-2 year horizon. Thanks for taking the time to read the article.

Francesca's stock plunges after profit, sales and outlook miss expectations
Shares of Francesca's Holdings Corp.  plunged 13% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the specialty apparel and accessories retailer missed fiscal first-quarter profit and sales expectations and provided a downbeat outlook. Net profit for the quarter to April 29 fell to $4.3 million, or 12 cents a share, from $7.1 million, or 18 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. That missed the FactSet consensus for earnings per share of 14 cents. Sales rose 1% to $107.7 million from $106.1 million, but was below the FactSet consensus of $113.2 million, as improved sales trends in April wasn't enough to offset soft sales in February and March. Same-store sales declined 5.0%, due primarily to a decline in boutique traffic and conversion rates, compared with the FactSet consensus for a 0.5% decline. For the second quarter, the company expects EPS of 13 cents to 18 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 28 cents. Sales are expected to be $120 million to $124 million for the current quarter, below the FactSet consensus of $126.2 million, while same-store sales guidance of down 3% to up 1% compares with the FactSet consensus of up 1.5%. The stock has plunged 33% year to date through Monday, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has lost 6.3% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

Francesca's stock plunges after profit, sales and outlook miss expectations
Shares of Francesca's Holdings Corp.  plunged 13% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the specialty apparel and accessories retailer missed fiscal first-quarter profit and sales expectations and provided a downbeat outlook. Net profit for the quarter to April 29 fell to $4.3 million, or 12 cents a share, from $7.1 million, or 18 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. That missed the FactSet consensus for earnings per share of 14 cents. Sales rose 1% to $107.7 million from $106.1 million, but was below the FactSet consensus of $113.2 million, as improved sales trends in April wasn't enough to offset soft sales in February and March. Same-store sales declined 5.0%, due primarily to a decline in boutique traffic and conversion rates, compared with the FactSet consensus for a 0.5% decline. For the second quarter, the company expects EPS of 13 cents to 18 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 28 cents.
