It's a daunting task to stay on top of everything your body needs to stay healthy. Your face needs makeup, hair needs accessories, and the body welcomes a massage. Take time to examine an area of your health and beauty regime that needs improvement. Maybe you've been meaning to take vitamins and dietary supplements or want a new fragrance to lift your spirits. Now is the time to make it happen.
Access Where You Are
 The jar of night cream is probably over a year old and needs a facelift. Your skin care program consists of rubbing soap into your skin, rinsing off with water, patting dry, and turning off the light. Your skin doesn't get any kind of sun protection and is beginning to have that dreaded alligator look. You're beginning to see that health and beauty takes a dive when it comes to oral care practices. Other than a six-month checkup, there's not much going on.
Skin Care Choices
Cleansers and toners remove deep-down dirt and grime and help prevent acne-prone skin from erupting. Use skin masks and peels to hydrate skin, remove excess oil, and reduce pore size. A moisturizer improves the texture of facial skin helping to soften fine lines and wrinkles. Every so often, use an exfoliator to remove dead skin cells so your skin has a healthy look. Remember to use suntan lotion especially on your face, throat, and neck. Anyone that works outside should cover any sun-exposed area.
Oral Health Care
Dental floss literally saves your teeth and gums from decay. It helps prevent cavities between your teeth and gum disease called gingivitis. Tongue cleaners remove accumulated bacteria that may contribute to tooth decay and bad breath. Electric toothbrushes provide a more thorough cleaning than using a hand-held brush because the bristles reach further between the teeth. This helps to remove more plaque and tartar build up. To improve your appearance, use a teeth whitening product that removes stains and whitens teeth for a brighter smile. Mouthwash helps keep your teeth cleaner when used with other oral health care products.Side Refine PanelShop by CategoryBath & Body ProductsSee all in Bath & Body ProductsBath & Body Bar SoapsBath &

Choosing frames that complement facial features is a great way to ensure proper vision care without sacrificing style. People with round faces should opt for styles that feature a clear nose bridge and narrow frames to elongate the face. For a square face shape, wider or oval frames make the face look thinner and soften the jawline. Those who have long faces should select frames that are deeper or feature patterns, such as floral prints or playful polka dots, in order to make the face appear shorter. When it comes to frame colors, consider skin tone, eye shade, and hair color. Choose frames that make the eye and hair colors pop rather than hues that make them look washed out.
What types of contact lens cases are available?
A popular type of contact lens case is the screw-top. Contact wearers simply place their lenses into the storage compartment along with the cleaning solution and then screw on the lids. This helps to prevent leaks and ensures the contacts stay scratch-free. There are also barrel cases that feature catalytic discs. A peroxide-based cleaning solution goes into the barrel with the contact lenses. The discs serve to neutralize the cleaning mixture, removing dirt and particles from the lenses. Travel lens cases are ideal for on-the-go contact wearers. They are lightweight, compact, and typically come with small cleaning solution bottles and tweezers.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryHealth & BeautyVision Care ProductsContact Lens Care SolutionsContact Lens CasesEyeglass CasesEye Drops & WashEyeglass Cloths & SpraysEyeglass FramesEyeglass Straps & CordsEyepatches & Eyeglass PatchesLow Vision MagnifiersPrescription GlassesReading GlassesEyeglass Replacement LensesOther Vision CareColorsee allBlackBlueBrownGoldGrayGreenMulti-ColorRedBrandsee allOliver PeoplesUnbrandedConditionsee allNewUsedNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

Tom Ford FT 5139 Eyeglasses 
                        Find many unisex frames in our selection of Tom Ford eyeglasses. When you want a neutral style, find it out of the many black plastic frames by Tom Ford. Although the brand carries the typical rectangular plastic style, wayfarer and aviator frames, also made from medium-thickness black plastic, are another option. Additionally, the brand has a selection of metal unisex frames, also with a similar angular style.  Not all Tom Ford glasses are unisex, and we carry some specific men�s and women�s style. As one of the most well-known high fashion brands, Tom Ford represents sophistication without going over the top, and all of the eyeglasses in our selection capture this.

                    People may view Oceanside  as being home to U.S. armed forces personnel, but times are changing. Oceanside has become quite the destination spot for vacationers. It is still a beach city where you can find a reasonably priced home to hang your hat as well. Development of hotels, fine restaurants, revamping of  PCH shopping centers, and remolding of condos is taking this old Military town to the next level.  Don't cut out Oceanside if your home search is near the beach!

                    Oceanside, Ca is located in the northern tip of coastal San Diego county.  Buyers are flocking to this beautiful coastal city because it is the most affordable option for coastal living here in San Diego.  Due to the mass of young families moving to the area, Oceanside has been changing drastically in a great way.  New hip stores and restaurants are lining the once dormant coast highway previously known as Hill St., giving families lots of options.  Every Thursday afternoon there is one of the best sunset farmers market in the city located right next to Oceanside pier with awesome food options and live music.

                    Oceanside is Southern California's most authentic beach town. Visitors to our beautiful city enjoy a quintessential California coastal escape that includes wide sandy beaches, a quaint New England-style harbor, historic wooden pier, and charming bungalow neighborhoods. O'side (as locals affectionately call it) is a destination of discovery where visitors can explore everything from California history at the "King of Missions" to surf culture at the California Surf Museum, and awe-inspiring sea life through exciting ocean adventures.

As a playful, fun, and diverse destination we value personal expression and originality, inviting locals and visitors to let loose and Respect the O'riginals. O'siders take adventure to the next level by surfing, skateboarding, bike riding, boating and even skydiving. We push culinary experiences to the limits with a flourishing food and craft beer scene reflecting Oceanside's creative and entrepreneurial spirit. Classically charming, eclectic, and always genuine, Oceanside is an ideal place to stay and a true o'riginal.

Perfectly situated between metropolitan San Diego and Los Angeles, Oceanside is centrally located in the heart of Southern California, in close proximity to the family-favorite attractions including LEGOLAND California Resort, SeaWorld San Diego, Disneyland California Resort, and the world-famous San Diego Zoo. With its year round sunny climate, and average temperature of 70 degrees, Oceanside's weather has been rated by USA Today as the second most ideal climate in the United States, and the fifth most ideal weather in the world.
