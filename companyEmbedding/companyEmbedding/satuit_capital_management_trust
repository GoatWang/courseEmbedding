STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in value, the Fund is likely to decline in value and you could lose money on your investment.
STOCK SELECTION RISKS: The portfolio securities selected by the Adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising and may fail to meet the Fund�s investment objective.
The Fund's investment objectives, risk, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing.

 RISK/RETURN SUMMARY

The following discussion describes the investment objective and principal       
investment strategies and risks of the Satuit Capital Small Cap Fund (the       
"Fund"). The investment objective of the Fund is a fundamental policy and cannot
be changed without the approval of a majority of the Fund's outstanding shares. 
As with any mutual fund, there can be no guarantee that the investment objective
of the Fund will be achieved.                                                   

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE - The Fund's investment objective is to provide investors  
with capital appreciation.                                                      

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES - The Fund seeks to achieve its investment      
objective by investing at least 80% of its assets in a diversified portfolio of 
U.S. common stocks of small-cap companies. The Adviser considers a company to be
a small-cap company when its market capitalization, at the time of purchase, is 
within the market capitalization range of companies in the Russell 2000(R) Index
at reconstitution each June ($261.8 million to $2.5 billion as of June 2007).   
The Adviser will select portfolio securities which the Adviser believes exhibit 
reasonable valuations and favorable growth prospects.                           

The Adviser utilizes proprietary quantitative analysis of both value and growth 
characteristics to rank U.S. small-cap companies. Valuation and growth          
characteristics are equally weighted for purposes of ranking potential          
investment securities. Valuation analysis is used to determine the inherent     
value of the company and requires the analysis of financial information such as 
a company's price to book, price to sales, return on equity, and return on      
assets ratios. Growth analysis is used to determine a company's potential for   
long-term dividends and earnings growth as determined by market-oriented factors
such as market share, the launch of new products or services, the strength of   
its management and market demand. From these analyses, the Adviser ranks the    
companies that exhibit stable and growing valuation ratios and the most         
favorable dividends and earnings prospects and lists them on what it refers to  
as the Focus List. The Adviser selects portfolio securities for investment by   
the Fund by subjecting the common stocks on the Focus List to a qualitative     
analysis of each company's valuation and growth characteristics in order to     
determine whether these characteristics are sustainable over the long term. Such
analysis includes a more detailed review of each company's competitive position 
in its particular market sector, its business prospects and financial           
statements. The Adviser also regularly conducts interviews with company         
management and Wall Street analysts who provide research about a company's      
common stock in the stock market.                                               

Portfolio securities may be sold as a result of adverse changes in the stock    
markets generally, or to a specific issuer, that results in poor relative       
performance. Portfolio securities may also be sold if the Adviser determines    
that the valuation and growth characteristics that formed the basis for         
purchasing a stock no longer meet the criteria for portfolio securities of the  
Fund.                                                                           

PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND - Investing in common stocks has       
inherent risks that could cause you to lose money. The principal risks of       
investing in the Fund are listed below and could adversely affect the net asset 
value (the "NAV"), total return and value of the Fund and your investment.      

o.....Stock Market Risks: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks  
  and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
     value, the Fund is likely to decline in value and you could lose money on
your investment.                                                    

o     Stock Selection Risks: The portfolio securities selected by the Adviser   
  may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in
   general is rising and may fail to meet the Fund's investment objective.

o     Investment     In     Small-Cap     Companies:     The    Fund    invests 
     principally  in companies with small market  capitalization  or companies
     that  have  relatively   small  revenues,   limited  product  lines,  and
     a  small   share  of  the  market   for  their   products   or   services
     (collectively,    "small   companies").    Small   companies   are   also
     characterized   by  the   following:   (i)  they   may   lack   depth  of
     management;  (ii)  they  may  be  unable  to  internally  generate  funds
     necessary   for  growth  or   potential   development   or  to   generate
     such funds  through  external  financing  on favorable  terms;  and (iii)
     they  may be  developing  or  marketing  new  products  or  services  for
     which   markets   are  not  yet   established   and  may   never   become
     established.  Due  to  these  and  other  factors,  small  companies  may
     suffer   significant    losses,   as   well   as   realize    substantial
     growth.   Thus,   securities   of   small   companies   present   greater
     risks  than  securities  of  larger,  more  established   companies.   If
     the  Fund  is  heavily   invested  in  these   securities,   the  NAV  of
     the  Fund   will  be  more   susceptible   to  sudden   and   significant
losses  if  the value of these securities decline.                  

You could lose money on your investment in the Fund, or the Fund may not perform
as well as other possible investments. The Fund does not constitute a balanced  
or complete investment program and the NAV of its shares will fluctuate based on
the value of the securities held by the Fund.                                   

WHO MAY WANT TO INVEST IN THE FUND

We designed the Fund for investors desiring an investment alternative and who   
seek one or more of the following:                                              

o     a long-term investment horizon;                                           
o     long-term capital appreciation;                                           
o     a stock fund to  compliment a portfolio of more  conservative             
investments;                                                        
o     a   stock   fund   that   uses   a   balanced   approach   of value       
and  growth investing; and/or                                       
o     a stock fund that invests in U.S. small-cap companies.                    

The Fund may NOT be suitable for you if:                                        

o     You need regular income or stability of principal;                        
o     You are  pursuing a short-term  goal or  investing  emergency reserves;   
and/or                                                              
o     You are pursuing an investment strategy that is highly speculative.       

 PERFORMANCE

The Fund commenced operations on March 1, 2000 as a separate portfolio of The   
World Funds, Inc. (the "Predecessor Fund"). The Fund was reorganized as a       
separate series of the Satuit Capital Management Trust on November 1, 2007. The 
Fund has the same investment strategy as the Predecessor Fund. However, prior to
April 10, 2007, the Predecessor Fund's investment strategy was to invest at     
least 80% of the Fund's assets in genomics related issues. The Adviser was      
appointed as investment sub-adviser to the Predecessor Fund on January 15, 2003 
and prior to such date had no affiliation with the Predecessor Fund.            
Accordingly, performance information set forth in the bar chart and table       
represents the performance of the Predecessor Fund's former investment strategy 
and, for the information related to the time period prior to January 15, 2003,  
the Predecessor Fund's former investment adviser.                               

The bar chart below and table presented on page 4 show how the Predecessor Fund 
has performed in the past and gives some indication of the risks of investing in
the Fund. Both assume that all dividends and distributions are reinvested in the
Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Predecessor Fund has varied
from year to year. The bar chart figures do not include any sales charges that  
investors will pay when they buy or sell shares of the Fund. If sales charges   
were included, the returns would be lower. Total return would have been lower   
had certain fees and expenses not been waived and/or reimbursed. The table      
compares the calendar year average annual total returns of the Predecessor Fund 
to the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the NASDAQ     
Composite Index. Keep in mind that the Predecessor Fund's past performance      
(before and after taxes) may not indicate how well the Fund will perform in the 
future.

the Fund. The maximum transaction costs and total annual expenses associated    
with investing in shares of the Fund are described in the table below and are   
further explained in the example that follows:

                                                 =====

(1)   You will be subject to a 2.00% deferred sales charge if you redeem your   
shares within three hundred sixty (360) days of purchase.           
(2)   A shareholder electing to redeem shares by telephone request may be       
charged $10 for each such redemption request.                       
(3)   A shareholder may be charged a $10 fee for each telephone exchange. (4)   
The Board of Trustees (the "Board") of the Satuit Capital           
Management Trust (the "Trust") has approved a Plan of Distribution  
pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
   amended (the "1940 Act"), providing for the payment of distribution and
service fees to the distributor of the Fund. See "Distribution
Arrangements- Rule 12b-1 Fees". The 12b-1 fees may cause long-term  
investors to pay more than the economic equivalent of the maximum   
      front-end sales charge permitted by the National Association of Securities
Dealers.                                                            
(5)   "Other Operating Expenses" include estimated amounts, for the initial     
   fiscal year, of Fund expenses such as administrative, custody, transfer
      agency and shareholder servicing fees. However, "Other Operating Expenses"
 do not include estimates related to portfolio trading commissions and
related expenses as determined under generally accepted accounting  
principles.                                                         
(6)   In the interest of limiting expenses of the Fund, the Adviser has assumed 
      the obligations of the Predecessor Fund's investment adviser, Commonwealth
     Capital Management, LLC (the "Predecessor Adviser") under the Predecessor
   Fund's Expense Limitation Agreement. Pursuant to the Expense Limitation
      Agreement, the Adviser has agreed to waive or limit its fees and to assume
 other expenses of the Fund until August 31, 2008 so that the ratio of
    total annual operating expenses for the Fund's Class Y Shares is limited
    to 1.90%. The Predecessor Adviser, however, will continue to be entitled
to the reimbursement of fees waived or reimbursed by the Predecessor
  Adviser for a period of five years following the Fund's reorganization
     into the Trust. The Adviser will also be entitled to the reimbursement of
fees waived or reimbursed by the Adviser to the Fund for five years 
 following such waiver or reimbursement, provided that the Predecessor
Adviser has received all applicable recoupment. The total amount of 
      reimbursement recoverable by the Predecessor Adviser or the Adviser is the
      sum of all fees previously waived or reimbursed by the Predecessor Adviser
  or the Adviser, as applicable, less any reimbursement previously paid.

Example:                                                                        

This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund  
with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you  
invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of
your shares at the end of these periods. The example also assumes that your     
investment has a 5% rate of return each year and that the Fund's operating      
expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower,    
based on these assumptions your costs would be:                                 

    1 Year   3 Years    5 Years   10 Years
    ------   -------    -------   --------

       $393     $1,389      $2,565      $5,418

You would pay the following expenses if you did not redeem your shares:         

    1 Year   3 Years    5 Years   10 Years
    ------   -------    -------   --------

       $193    $1,389       $2,565      $5,418

The example does not reflect sales charges (loads) on reinvested dividends and  
other distributions. If these sales charges (loads) were included, your costs   
would be higher.                                                                

 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGIES

Investment Objective - The investment objective of the Fund is capital          
appreciation.                                                                   

Principal Investment Strategies - The Fund seeks to achieve its investment      
objective by investing at least 80% of its assets in a diversified portfolio of 
U.S. common stocks of small-cap companies. The Adviser considers a company to be
a small-cap company when its market capitalization, at the time of purchase, is 
within the market capitalization range of companies in the Russell 2000(R) Index
at reconstitution each June ($261.8 million to $2.5 billion as of June 2007).   
The Adviser will select portfolio securities which the Adviser believes exhibit 
reasonable valuations and favorable growth prospects.                           

Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets 
in equity securities of small-cap companies. This is not a fundamental policy   
and may be changed by the Board without a vote of shareholders, upon sixty (60) 
days' prior notice.                                                             

The Adviser utilizes proprietary quantitative analysis of both value and growth 
characteristics to rank U.S. small-cap companies. Valuation and growth          
characteristics are equally weighted for purposes of ranking potential          
investments securities. Valuation analysis is used to determine the inherent    
value of the company and requires the analysis of financial information such as 
a company's price to book, price to sales, return on equity, and return on      
assets ratios. Growth analysis is used to determine a company's potential for   
long-term dividends and earnings growth as determined by market-oriented factors
such as market share, the launch of new products or services, the strength of   
its management and market demand. From these analyses, the Adviser ranks the    
companies that exhibit stable and growing valuation ratios and the most         
favorable dividends and earnings prospects and lists them on what it refers to  
as the "Focus List."                                                            

The Adviser selects portfolio securities for investment by the Fund by          
subjecting the common stocks on the Focus List to a qualitative analysis of each
company's valuation and growth characteristics in order to determine whether    
these characteristics are sustainable over the long term. Such analysis includes
a more detailed review of each company's competitive position in its particular 
market sector, its business prospects and financial statements. The Adviser also
regularly conducts interviews with company management and Wall Street analysts  
who provide research about a company's common stock in the stock market.        

The Adviser will constantly monitor the Fund's investment portfolio positions   
for adverse changes in the Fund's investment portfolio. Portfolio securities may
be sold as a result of adverse changes in the stock markets generally, or to a  
specific issuer, that results in poor relative performance. Portfolio securities
may also be sold if the Adviser determines that the valuation and growth        
characteristics that formed the basis for purchasing a stock no longer meet the 
criteria for portfolio securities of the Fund.                                  

Temporary Defensive Strategy - At times, the Fund may employ temporary defensive
strategies in response to unfavorable economic, market, political or other      
conditions. At such times, the Fund may increase its cash reserves without limit
by holding high quality, short-term debt securities and money market instruments
and by entering into repurchase agreements. These investments are inconsistent  
with the Fund's primary investment strategies. As a result, during these        
periods, the Fund may not achieve its objective.                                

Portfolio Turnover - As stated above, the Adviser recognizes that investment    
management is a dynamic process and thus will constantly monitor and reevaluate 
the Fund's investments in order to maximize, to the extent possible, the capital
appreciation of the investment portfolio. This process allows the Adviser to    
determine whether any of the Fund's investments have lost value or whether      
securities not held by the Fund seem poised for growth under developing market  
conditions and to adjust the Fund's holdings accordingly. The Adviser does not  
anticipate this process to result in high portfolio turnover and does not intend
to aggressively trade the Fund's assets. The Fund expects that its annual       
portfolio turnover rate will be, under normal conditions, between 100% and 200%.
If the Fund does a lot of trading, it may incur additional operating expenses,  
which would reduce performance, and could cause shareowners to incur a higher   
level of taxable income or capital gains.                                       

 RISKS

All mutual funds carry a certain amount of risk, which may cause you to lose    
money on your investment. The following describes the primary risks of investing
in the Fund based on the Fund's specific investment objective and strategies. As
all investment securities are subject to inherent market risks and fluctuations 
in value due to earnings, economic and political conditions and other factors,  
the Fund cannot give any assurance that its investment objective will be        
achieved.                                                                       

Stock Market Risks - The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate based on changes in the 
value of the securities held in the investment portfolio. The stock market is   
generally susceptible to volatile fluctuations in market price. Market prices of
securities in which the Fund invests may be adversely affected by an issuer     
having experienced losses or by the lack of earnings or by the issuer's failure 
to meet the market's expectations with respect to new products or services, or  
even by factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of the issuer. The   
value of the securities held by the Fund is also subject to the risk that a     
specific segment of the stock market does not perform as well as the overall    
market. Under any of these circumstances, the value of the Fund's shares and    
total return will fluctuate, and your investment may be worth more or less than 
your original cost when you redeem your shares.                                 

Stock Selection Risks - Like all managed funds, there is a risk that the        
Adviser's strategy for managing the Fund may not achieve the desired results.   

The portfolio securities selected by the Adviser may decline in value or not    
increase in value when the stock market in general is rising and may fail to    
meet the Fund's investment objective. In addition, the price of common stock    
moves up and down in response to corporate earnings and developments, economic  
and market conditions and anticipated events. As a result, the price of the     
Fund's investments may go down and you could lose money on your investment.     

Investment In Small-Cap Companies - The Fund invests principally in companies   
with small market capitalization or companies that have relatively small        
revenues, limited product lines, and a small share of the market for their      
products or services (collectively, "small companies"). Small companies are also
characterized by the following: (i) they may lack depth of management; (ii) they
may be unable to internally generate funds necessary for growth or potential    
development or to generate such funds through external financing on favorable   
terms; and (iii) they may be developing or marketing new products or services   
for which markets are not yet established and may never become established. Due 
to these and other factors, small companies may suffer significant losses, as   
well as realize substantial growth. Thus, securities of small companies present 
greater risks than securities of larger, more established companies. If the Fund
is heavily invested in these securities, the NAV of the Fund will be more       
susceptible to sudden and significant losses if the value of these securities   
decline.                                                                        

Historically, stocks of small companies have been more volatile than stocks of  
larger companies and are, therefore, more speculative than investments in larger
companies. Among the reasons for the greater price volatility are the following:
(1) the less certain growth prospects of smaller companies; (2) the lower degree
of liquidity in the markets for such stocks; and (3) the greater sensitivity of 
small companies to changing economic conditions. Besides exhibiting greater     
volatility, small company stocks may, to a degree, fluctuate independently of   
larger company stocks. Small company stocks may decline in price as large       
company stocks rise, or rise in price as large company stocks decline. To the   
extent that securities of small companies are not liquid, the Fund will limit   
its investments in such securities to not more than 15% its of assets. You      
should expect that the value of Fund shares may be more volatile than the shares
of a mutual fund investing primarily in larger company stocks.                  

Investment In Micro-Cap Companies - Certain of the Fund's investments may be    
considered investments in micro-cap companies (companies with a market          
capitalization of between $200 million and $500 million). Accordingly, the Fund 
may be subject to the additional risks associated with investment in companies  
with micro capital structures. These companies may (i) have relatively small    
revenues, (ii) have limited product lines or services, (iii) lack depth of      
management, (iv) lack the ability to obtain funds necessary for growth, and (v) 
feature products or services for which a market does not yet exist and/or may   
ever be established. The increased risk involved with investing in micro-cap    
companies may cause the market prices of their securities to be more volatile   
than those of larger, more established companies. Further, these securities tend
to trade at a lower volume than do those of larger, more established companies. 
If the Fund is heavily invested in these securities and the value of these      
securities suddenly decline, the NAV of the Fund will be more susceptible to    
sudden and significant losses.                                                  

Temporary Defensive Positions - When the Fund's management believes that        
investments should be deployed in a temporary defensive posture because of      
economic or market conditions, the Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in  
U.S. Government securities (such as bills, notes, or bonds of the U.S.          
Government and its agencies) or other forms of indebtedness such as bonds or    
certificates of deposits. When the Fund is in a temporary defensive position it 
may not achieve its investment objective of capital appreciation.               

DISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS

A description of the Fund's policies and procedures with respect to the         
disclosure of the Fund's portfolio securities is available in the Fund's SAI.   

MANAGEMENT

The Board - The business of the Fund is managed under the direction of the Board
of Trustees (the "Board") of Satuit Capital Management Trust (the "Trust"). The 
Board formulates the general policies of the Fund and meets periodically to     
review the Fund's performance, monitor investment activities and practices, and 
discuss other matters affecting the Fund.                                       

The Adviser - Satuit Capital Management, LLC, 2807 Gaston Gate, Mt. Pleasant,   
South Carolina 29466, manages the investments of the Fund pursuant to an        
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement"). As of June 30, 2007,  
the Adviser had approximately $155 million in assets under management.          

Robert J. Sullivan, Chairman of the Trust, is the majority owner of the Adviser.
John Pasco, III, owner of the principal underwriter of the Fund, owns an        
interest in the Adviser through Commonwealth Capital Management, LLC. Under the 
Advisory Agreement, the Adviser, subject to the general supervision of the      
Board, manages the Fund in accordance with its investment objective and         
policies, makes decisions with respect to, and places orders for, all purchases 
and sales of portfolio securities, and maintains related records.               

Under the Advisory Agreement, the monthly compensation paid to the Adviser is   
accrued daily at an annual rate of 1.00% on the average daily net assets of the 
Fund.                                                                           

In the interest of limiting expenses of the Fund, the Adviser has assumed the   
obligations of the Predecessor Adviser under the Predecessor Fund's Expense     
Limitation Agreement. Pursuant to the Expense Limitation Agreement, the Adviser 
has agreed to waive or limit its fees and to assume other expenses of the Fund  
until August 31, 2008 so that the ratio of total annual operating expenses for  
the Fund's Class Y Shares is limited to 1.90%. The Predecessor Adviser, however,
will continue to be entitled to the reimbursement of fees waived or reimbursed  
by the Predecessor Adviser for a period of five years following the Fund's      
reorganization into the Trust. The Adviser will also be entitled to the         
reimbursement of fees waived or reimbursed by the Adviser to the Fund for five  
years following such waiver or reimbursement, provided that the Predecessor     
Adviser has received all applicable recoupment. The total amount of             
reimbursement recoverable by the Predecessor Adviser or the Adviser is the sum  
of all fees previously waived or reimbursed by the Predecessor Adviser or the   
Adviser, as applicable, less any reimbursement previously paid.                 

A discussion regarding the basis for the Board's approval of the investment     
advisory contract is available in the Predecessor Fund's Annual Report to       
Shareholders for the period ended August 31, 2007.                              

Investment Committee - The Adviser's investment committee (the "Investment
Committee") is charged with the overall management of the Fund's portfolio,     
including development and implementation of overall portfolio strategy and the  
day-to-day management of the portfolio. Members of the Investment Committee     
include: (1) Mr. Robert J. Sullivan, Chief Investment Officer; (2) Mr. Robert   
Johnson, Senior Equity Analyst; and (3) Mr. Jeffrey MacCune, Director of Equity

YOUR ACCOUNT

Types of Accounts - If you are making an initial investment in the Fund, you    
will need to open an account. You may establish the following types of accounts:

Individual, Sole Proprietorship and Joint Accounts. Individual and sole         
proprietorship accounts are owned by one person; joint accounts can have two or 
more owners. All owners of the joint account must sign written instructions to  
purchase or redeem shares or to change account information exactly as their     
names appear on the account. If you elect telephone privileges, however,        
redemption requests by telephone may be made by any one of the joint account    
owners.                                                                         

Uniform Gift or Transfer To Minor Accounts (UGMA OR UTMA). Depending on the laws
of your state, you may set up a custodial account under the Uniform Gift (or    
Transfers) to Minors Act. These custodial accounts provide a way to give a child
up to $10,000 per year without paying Federal gift tax under the Uniform Gift   
(or Transfers) to Minors Act. To open a UGMA or UTMA account, you must include  
the minor's social security number on the application, and the custodian, or    
trustee, of the UGMA or UTMA must sign instructions in a manner indicating      
trustee capacity.                                                               

Corporate and Partnership Accounts. To open a corporate or partnership account, 
or to send instructions to the Fund, the following documents are required:      

o     For corporations, a corporate resolution signed by an authorized person   
with a signature guarantee.                                         
o     For partnerships, a certification for a partnership agreement, or the     
    pages from the partnership agreement that identify the general partners.
o     An authorized officer of the corporation or other legal entity must sign  
the application.                                                    

Trust Accounts. The trust must be established before you can open a trust       
account. To open the account you must include the name of each trustee, the name
of the trust and provide a certification for trust, or the pages from the trust 
document that identify the trustees.                                            

HOW TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT AND PURCHASE SHARES 

Once you have chosen the type of account that you want to open, you are ready to
establish an account.                                                           

General Information - The Fund does not issue share certificates. You will      
receive quarterly account statements and a confirmation of each transaction. You
should verify the accuracy of all transactions in your account as soon as you   
receive your account statement. During unusual market conditions, the Fund may  
temporarily suspend or discontinue any service or privilege.                    

Purchasing Shares - Shares of the Fund may be purchased directly from First     
Dominion Capital Corp. ("FDCC" or the "Distributor") or through brokers or      
dealers who are authorized by the Distributor to sell shares of the Fund. Shares
of the Fund are also offered through financial supermarkets, investment advisers
and consultants, and other investment professionals. Investment professionals   
who offer shares may require the payment of fees from their individual clients. 
If you invest through a third party, the policies and fees may be different from
those described in this prospectus. For example, third parties may charge       
transaction fees or set different minimum investment amounts. A sales charge may
apply to your purchase, exchange or redemption of Fund shares.                  

Customer Identification Program - Federal regulations require that the company  
through which you open an account obtain certain personal information about you 
when opening a new account. As a result, the company must obtain the following  
information for each person that opens a new account:                           

o     Name;                                                                     
o     Date of birth (for individuals);                                          
o     Residential   or   business   street   address   (although   post  office 
boxes are still permitted for mailing); and                         
o     Social security number, taxpayer identification number, or other          
identifying number.                                                 

You may also be asked for a copy of your driver's license, passport, or other   
identifying document in order to verify your identity. In addition, it may be   
necessary to verify your identity by cross-referencing your identification      
information with a consumer report or other electronic database. Additional     
information may be required to open accounts for corporations and other         
entities.                                                                       

After an account is opened, the company may restrict your ability to purchase   
additional shares until your identity is verified. The company also may close   
your account or take other appropriate action if they are unable to verify your 
identity within a reasonable time. If your account is closed for this reason,   
your shares will be redeemed at the NAV next calculated after the account is    
closed.                                                                         

Minimum Investments - The minimum initial investment in each class of shares of 
the Fund is $1,000. Additional investments in each class must be in amounts of  
$250 or more. The minimum initial investment in retirement accounts (such as an 
IRA) is $1,000. Additional investments in retirement accounts must be in amounts
of $250 or more. The Fund retains the right to waive the minimum initial        
investment or to refuse to accept an order.                                     

Share Class Alternatives - The Fund is authorized to offer investors four       
different classes of shares, one of which, Class Y Shares, is offered by this   
prospectus. As of the date of this prospectus, the Fund's Class A, Class B and  
Class C shares are not available for sale. The different classes of shares      
represent investments in the same portfolio of securities, but the classes are  
subject to different expenses and may have different share prices. When you buy 
shares be sure to specify the class of shares in which you choose to invest.    
Because each share class has a different combination of sales charges, expenses 
and other features, you should consult your financial adviser to determine which
class best meets your financial objectives.                                     

Public Offering Price - When you buy shares of the Fund, you will receive the   
public offering price per share as determined after your order is received in   
proper form. The public offering price is equal to the Fund's NAV plus an       
initial sales charge, if any. For more information on how we price shares, see  
"WHEN AND HOW NAV IS DETERMINED". The Fund reserves the right to refuse to      
accept an order in certain circumstances, such as, but not limited to, orders   
from short-term investors such as market timers, or orders without proper       
documentation.                                                                  

 DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS

The Fund is offered through financial supermarkets, investment advisers and     
consultants, financial planners, brokers, dealers and other investment          
professionals, and directly through the Fund's Distributor. Investment          
professionals who offer shares may request fees from their individual clients.  
If you invest through a third party, the policies and fees may be different than
those described in this prospectus. For example, third parties may charge       
transaction fees or set different minimum investment amounts.                   

Rule 12b-1 Fees - The Board has adopted a Plan of Distribution for the Fund's   
shares pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act (the "Rule 12b-1 Plan").       
Pursuant to the Rule 12b-1 Plan, the Fund may finance certain activities or     
expenses that are intended primarily to result in the sale of its shares. The   
Fund finances these distribution activities through payments made to the        
Distributor. The Fund may pay distribution fees, pursuant to its Rule 12b-1     
Plan, at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets.  
The Fund may pay such distribution fees for activities and expenses borne in the
past 12 months in connection with the distribution of its shares as to which no 
Rule 12b-1 Plan distribution fee was paid because of the expense limitation.    
Because these fees are paid out of the Fund's assets on an ongoing basis, over  
time these fees will increase the cost of your investment and may cost more than
paying other types of sales charges.                                            

General - The Fund reserves the right in its sole discretion to withdraw all or 
any part of the offering of shares when, in the judgment of management, such    
withdrawal is in the best interest of the Fund. An order to purchase shares is  
not binding on, and may be rejected by, the Fund until it has been confirmed in 
writing by the Fund and payment has been received.                              

Method of Purchase.

Please be sure to specify which class of shares you choose to invest in.        

Automatic Investment Plans - You may invest a specified amount of money in the  
Fund once or twice a month on specified dates pursuant to an Automatic          
Investment Plan ("AIP"). These payments are taken from your bank account by     
automated clearinghouse ("ACH") payment. The minimum investment for an AIP is   
$100. To open an AIP account, call or write to us to request an "Automatic      
Investment" form. Complete and sign the form, and return it to us along with a  
voided check for the bank account from which payments will be made.             

Transactions Through Third Parties - You may buy and sell shares of the Fund    
through certain brokers (and their authorized agents) that have made            
arrangements with the Fund's Distributor to sell Fund shares. When you place    
your order with such a broker or its authorized agent, your order is treated by 
the broker as if you had placed it directly with the Fund, and you will pay or  
receive the next price calculated by the Fund. The broker (or authorized agent) 
is responsible for processing your order correctly and promptly, keeping you    
advised regarding the status of your individual account, confirming your        
transactions and ensuring that you receive copies of the Fund's current         
prospectus. The broker (or its authorized agent) may charge you a fee for       
handling your order.                                                            

How to Pay for Your Purchase of Shares - You may purchase shares of the Fund by 
check, ACH payment, or wire. All payments must be in U.S. dollars.              

Checks. All checks must be drawn on U.S. banks and made payable to "Satuit
Capital Small Cap Fund." No other method of check payment is acceptable (for    
instance, you may not pay by travelers check).                                  

ACH Payments. Instruct your financial institution to make an ACH payment to us. 
These payments typically take two days. Your financial institution may charge   
you a fee for this service.                                                     

Wires. Instruct your financial institution to make a Federal funds wire payment 
to us. Your financial institution may charge you a fee for this service.        

Limitations on Purchases - The Fund reserves the right to refuse any purchase   
request, particularly requests that could adversely affect the Fund or its      
operations. This includes those from any individual or group who, in the Fund's 
view, is likely to engage in excessive trading (usually defined as more than    
four exchanges out of the Fund within a calendar year).                         

Cancelled or Failed Payments - The Fund accepts checks and ACH transfers at full
value subject to collection. If your payment for shares is not received or you  
pay with a check or ACH transfer that does not clear, your purchase will be     
cancelled. You will be responsible for any losses or expenses incurred by the   
Fund or the Transfer Agent, and the Fund may redeem other shares you own in the 
account as reimbursement. The Fund and its agents have the right to reject or   
cancel any purchase, exchange, or redemption due to non-payment. If we cancel   
your purchase due to non-payment, you will be responsible for any loss the Fund 
incurs. We will not accept cash or third-party checks for the purchase of       
shares.                                                                         

In compliance with the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001, please note that the Fund's     
Transfer Agent will verify certain information on your account application as   
part of the Trust's Anti-Money Laundering Program. As requested on the account  
application, you should supply your full name, date of birth, social security   
number and permanent street address. Mailing addresses containing a P. O. Box   
will not be accepted. Please call (800) 567-4030 if you need additional         
assistance when completing your account application.                            

If we are unable to verify your identity, as required by anti-money laundering  
laws, we may refuse to open your account or may open your account pending       
verification of your identity. If we subsequently are unable to verify your     
identity, we may close your account and return to you the value of your shares  
at the next calculated NAV.                                                     

HOW TO SELL (REDEEM) SHARES OF THE FUND 

You have the right to sell ("redeem") all or any part of your shares subject to 
certain restrictions. Selling your shares in the Fund is referred to as a       
"redemption" because the Fund buys back its shares. The Fund's procedure is to  
redeem shares at the NAV determined after the Transfer Agent receives the       
redemption request in proper order, less any applicable deferred sales charge.  
See "Redemption Procedures" below. We will mail your redemption proceeds to your
current address or transmit them electronically to your designated bank account.
Except under certain emergency conditions, we will send your redemption to you  
within seven (7) calendar days after we receive your redemption request. During 
unusual market conditions, the Fund may suspend redemptions or postpone the     
payment of redemption proceeds, to the extent permitted under the Federal       
securities laws. Delays may occur in cases of very large redemptions, excessive 
trading or during unusual market conditions. If you purchase your shares by     
check, the Fund may delay sending the proceeds from your redemption request     
until your check has cleared. This could take up to fifteen (15) calendar days. 

The Fund cannot accept requests that specify a certain date for redemption or   
which specify any other special conditions. Please call (800) 567-4030 for      
further information regarding redemptions. WE WILL NOT PROCESS YOUR REDEMPTION  
REQUEST IF IT IS NOT IN PROPER FORM (SEE REDEMPTION PROCEDURES"). HOWEVER, WE   
WILL NOTIFY YOU IF YOUR REDEMPTION REQUEST IS NOT IN PROPER FORM.               

Redemption Procedures.                                                          

By Mail - To redeem shares of the Fund, your redemption request must be in      
proper form. To redeem by mail, prepare a written request including:            

o     Your name(s) and signature(s);                                            
o     The name of the Fund, and your account number;                            
o     The dollar amount or number of shares you want to redeem;                 
o     How and where to send your proceeds;                                      
o     A  signature   guarantee,   if   required   (see   "Signature   Guarantee 
Requirements"); and                                                 
o     Any other legal documents required for redemption requests by             
corporations, partnerships or trusts.                               

Mail your request and documentation to:                                         

Satuit Capital Small Cap Fund                                                   
c/o Fund Services, Inc.                                                         
8730 Stony Point Parkway, Suite 205                                             
Richmond, Virginia 23235                                                        

By Wire - You may only request payment of your redemption proceeds by wire if   
you have previously elected wire redemption privileges on your account          
application or a separate form. Wire requests are only available if your        
redemption is for $10,000 or more.                                              

To request a wire redemption, mail or call us with your request. If you wish to 
make your wire request by telephone, however, you must have previously elected  
telephone redemption privileges.                                                

By Telephone - We accept redemption requests by telephone only if you have      
elected telephone redemption privileges on your account application or on a     
separate form.                                                                  

To redeem shares by telephone, call us with your request. You will need to      
provide your account number and the exact name(s) in which the account is       
registered. We may also require a password or additional forms of               
identification.                                                                 

Your proceeds will be mailed to you or wired to you (if you have elected wire   
redemption privileges - See "By Wire" above). Telephone redemptions are easy and
convenient, but this account option involves a risk of loss from unauthorized or
fraudulent transactions. We will take reasonable precautions to protect your    
account from fraud. You should do the same by keeping your account information  
private and by reviewing immediately any account statement and transaction      
confirmations that you receive. Neither the Fund nor the Transfer Agent will be 
responsible for any losses due to telephone fraud, so long as we have taken     
reasonable steps to verify the caller's identity.                               

Automatic Redemption - If you own shares of the Fund with an aggregated value of
at least $10,000, you may request a specified amount of money from your account 
once a month or once a quarter on a specified date. These payments are sent from
your account to a designated bank account by ACH payment. Automatic requests    
must be for at least $100.                                                      

To set up periodic redemptions automatically, call or write the Fund for an     
"Automatic Redemption" form. You should complete the form and mail it to the    
Fund with a voided check for the account into which you would like the          
redemption proceeds deposited.                                                  

Signature Guarantee Requirements - To protect you and the Fund against fraud,   
signatures on certain requests must have a "signature guarantee." For requests  
made in writing a signature guarantee is required for any of the following:     

o     Changes to a record name or address of an account;                        
o     Redemption   from  an   account   for  which  the   address   or  account 
registration has changed within the last 30 days;                   
o     Sending  proceeds  to  any  person,  address,   brokerage  firm  or  bank 
account not on record;                                              
o     Sending     proceeds     to    an     account     with    a     different 
registration  (name or ownership) from yours; or                    
o     Changes to automatic investment or redemption programs, distribution      
   options, telephone or wire redemption privileges, any other election in
connection with your account.                                       

An original signature guarantee assures that a signature is genuine so that you 
are protected from unauthorized account transactions. Notarization is not an    
acceptable substitute. Acceptable guarantors only include participants in the   
Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP2000). Participants in       
STAMP2000 may include financial institutions such as banks, savings and loan    
associations, trust companies, credit unions, broker-dealers and member firms of
a national securities exchange.                                                 

Small Accounts - If the value of your account falls below $1,000, the Fund may  
ask you to increase your balance. If the account value is still below $1,000    
after 30 days, the Fund will provide you with 60 days written notice in order to
allow you a reasonable opportunity to increase the size of your account. If     
after the 60 days notice period, your account remains below $1,000, the Fund may
close your account and send you the proceeds. The Fund will not close your      
account, however, if it falls below $1,000 solely as a result of a reduction in 
your account's market value.                                                    

Transferring Registration - If you wish to transfer shares to another owner,    
send a written request to the Transfer Agent at 8730 Stony Point Parkway, Suite 
205, Richmond, Virginia 23235. Your request should include (1) the name of the  
Fund and existing account registration; (2) signature(s) of the registered      
owner(s); (3) the new account registration, address, Social Security Number or  
Taxpayer Identification Number and how dividends and capital gains are to be    
distributed; (4) signature guarantees; and (5) any additional documents which   
are required for transfer by corporations, administrators, executors, trustees, 
guardians, etc. If you have any questions about transferring shares, call the   
Transfer Agent at (800) 628-4077.                                               

Lost Accounts - The Transfer Agent will consider your account "lost" if         
correspondence to your address of record is returned as undeliverable, unless   
the Transfer Agent determines your new address. When an account is "lost," all  
distributions on the account will be reinvested in additional shares of the     
Fund. In addition, the amount of any outstanding (unpaid for six months or more)
checks for distributions that have been returned to the Transfer Agent will be  
reinvested and the checks will be cancelled.

WHEN AND HOW NAV IS DETERMINED

The Fund's share price, called its NAV, is determined as of the close of trading
on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") (generally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) 
on each business day that the NYSE is open (the "Valuation Time"). As of the    
date of this prospectus, the Trust is informed that the NYSE will be closed on  
the following holidays: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents  
Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day   
and Christmas Day. NAV per share is computed by adding the total value of the   
Fund's investments and other assets attributable to the Fund's shares,          
subtracting any liabilities and then dividing by the total number of shares     
outstanding.                                                                    

Shares are bought, sold or exchanged at the NAV determined after a request has  
been received in proper form. Any request received in proper form before the    
Valuation Time will be processed the same business day. Any request received in 
proper form after the Valuation Time will be processed the next business day.   

The Fund reserves the right to refuse to accept an order in certain             
circumstances, such as, but not limited to, orders from short-term investors    
such as market timers, or orders without proper documentation.                  

If a security or securities that the Fund owns are traded when the NYSE is      
closed (for example in an after-hours market) the value of the Fund's assets may
be affected on days when the Fund is not open for business. In addition, trading
in some of the Fund's assets may not occur on days when the Fund is open for    
business.                                                                       

The Fund's securities are valued primarily on the basis of market quotations.   
Certain short-term securities are valued on the basis of amortized cost. If     
market quotations are not readily available for a security or if a security's   
value has been materially affected by events occurring after the close of the   
exchange or market on which the security is principally traded, then that       
security may be valued by another method that the Board believes accurately     
reflects fair value. A security's valuation may differ depending on the method  
used for determining value.                                                     

The Fund has a policy that contemplates the use of fair value pricing to        
determine the NAV per share of the Fund when market prices are unavailable as   
well as under special circumstances, such as (i) if the primary market for a    
portfolio security suspends or limits trading or price movements of the security
and (ii) when an event occurs after the close of the exchange on which a        
portfolio security is principally traded that is likely to have changed the     
value of the security. Since most of the Fund's investments are in U.S. common  
stocks traded on U.S. securities exchanges, it is anticipated that the use of   
fair value pricing will be limited.                                             

When the Fund uses fair value pricing to determine the NAV per share of the     
Fund, securities will not be priced on the basis of quotations from the primary 
market in which they are traded, but rather may be priced by another method that
the Board believes accurately reflects fair value. Any method used will be      
approved by the Board and results will be monitored to evaluate accuracy. The   
Fund's policy is intended to result in a calculation of the Fund's NAV that     
fairly reflects security values as of the time of pricing. However, fair values 
determined pursuant to the Fund's procedures may not accurately reflect the     
price that the Fund could obtain for a security if it were to dispose of that   
security as of the time of pricing.                                             

 DISTRIBUTIONS

As a shareholder, you are entitled to your share of the Fund's net income and   
capital gains on its investments. The Fund passes substantially all of its      
earnings along to its investors as distributions. When the Fund earns dividends 
from stocks and interest from bonds and other debt securities and distributes   
these earnings to shareholders, it is called a dividend distribution. The Fund  
realizes capital gains when it sells securities for a higher price than it paid.

When net long-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders, it is called a
capital gain distribution. Net short-term capital gains are considered ordinary 
income and are included in dividend distributions.                              

The Fund distributes dividends and capital gains, if any, annually. All         
distributions are reinvested in additional shares, unless you elect to receive  
distributions in cash. For Federal income tax purposes, distributions are       
treated the same whether they are received in cash or reinvested. Shares become 
entitled to receive distributions on the day after the shares are issued.       

If you have elected to receive distributions in cash, and the postal or other   
delivery service returns your check to the Fund as undeliverable, you will not  
receive interest on amounts represented by the uncashed checks.                 

Long-Term vs. Short-Term Capital Gains:                                         

o     Long-term capital gains are realized on securities held by the Fund for   
more than one year and are part of your capital gain distribution.  

o     Short-term capital gains are realized on securities held by the Fund for  
less then one year and are part of your dividend distributions.     

Frequent Purchases and Sales of Fund Shares - Frequent purchases and redemptions
of mutual fund shares may interfere with the efficient management of a fund's   
portfolio by its portfolio manager, increase portfolio transaction costs, and   
have a negative effect on a fund's long term shareholders. For example, in order
to handle large flows of cash into and out of a fund, the portfolio manager may 
need to allocate more assets to cash or other short-term investments or sell    
securities, rather than maintaining full investment in securities selected to   
achieve the Fund's investment objective. Frequent trading may cause a fund to   
sell securities at less favorable prices. Transaction costs, such as brokerage  
commissions and market spreads, can detract from the Fund's performance. In     
addition, the return received by long term shareholders may be reduced when     
trades by other shareholders are made in an effort to take advantage of certain 
pricing discrepancies, when, for example, it is believed that the Fund's share  
price, which is determined at the close of the NYSE on each trading day, does   
not accurately reflect the value of the Fund's portfolio securities. Funds      
investing in foreign securities have been particularly susceptible to this form 
of arbitrage, but other funds could also be affected.                           

Because of the potential harm to the Fund and its long term shareholders, the   
Board has approved policies and procedures that are intended to discourage and  
prevent excessive trading and market timing abuses through the use of various   
surveillance techniques. Under these policies and procedures, the Fund may limit
additional exchanges or purchases of Fund shares by shareholders who are        
believed by the Adviser to be engaged in these abusive trading activities. The  
intent of the policies and procedures is not to inhibit legitimate strategies,  
such as asset allocation, dollar cost averaging, or similar activities that may 
nonetheless result in frequent trading of Fund shares. For this reason, the     
Board has not adopted any specific restrictions on purchases and sales of Fund  
shares, but the Fund reserves the right to reject any exchange or purchase of   
Fund shares with or without prior notice to the account holder. In cases where  
surveillance of a particular account establishes what the Adviser identifies as 
market timing, the Adviser will seek to block future purchases and exchanges of 
Fund shares by that account. Where surveillance of a particular account         
indicates activity that the Adviser believes could be either abusive or for     
legitimate purposes, the Fund may permit the account holder to justify the      
activity. The policies and procedures will be applied uniformly to all          
shareholders and the Fund will not accommodate market timers.                   

The policies apply to any account, whether an individual account or accounts    
with financial intermediaries such as investment advisers, broker dealers or    
retirement plan administrators, commonly called omnibus accounts, where the     
intermediary holds Fund shares for a number of its customers in one account.    
Omnibus account arrangements permit multiple investors to aggregate their       
respective share ownership positions and purchase, redeem and exchange Fund     
shares without the identity of the particular shareholder(s) being known to the 
Fund. Accordingly, the ability of the Fund to monitor and detect frequent share 
trading activity through omnibus accounts is very limited and there is no       
guarantee that the Fund will be able to identify shareholders who may be        
engaging in frequent trading activity through omnibus accounts or to curtail    
such trading.                                                                   

The Fund's policies provide for ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of      
current policies and surveillance tools, and the Board reserves the right to    
modify these or adopt additional policies and restrictions in the future.       
Shareholders should be aware, however, that any surveillance techniques         
currently employed by the Fund or other techniques that may be adopted in the   
future, may not be effective, particularly where the trading takes place through
certain types of omnibus accounts. As noted above, if the Fund is unable to     
detect and deter trading abuses, the Fund's performance, and its long term      
shareholders, may be harmed. In addition, because the Fund has not adopted any  
specific limitations or restrictions on the trading of Fund shares, shareholders
may be harmed by the extra costs and portfolio management inefficiencies that   
result from frequent trading of Fund shares, even when the trading is not for   
abusive purposes.                                                               

FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS

Your investment will have tax consequences that you should consider. Some of the
more common federal income tax consequences are described here but you should   
consult your tax consultant about your particular situation. Although it is not 
an investment objective, the Adviser will attempt to take into account the tax  
consequences of its investment decisions. However, there may be occasions when  
the Adviser's investment decisions will result in a negative tax consequence for
the Fund's shareholders. For more detailed information regarding tax            
considerations, see the Fund's SAI.                                             

Taxes On Distributions - The Fund operates in a manner such that it will not be 
liable for Federal income or excise tax. Distributions, whether received in cash
or reinvested in additional shares of the Fund, may be subject to local, state  
and federal taxes. Distributions of net investment income or short-term capital 
gain are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions of long-term capital  
gain are taxable to you as long-term capital gain, regardless of how long you   
have held your shares. Under current law, certain income distributions paid by  
the Fund to individual taxpayers are taxed at rates equal to those applicable to
net long-term capital gains (generally, 15%). This tax treatment applies only if
certain holding period requirements and other requirements are satisfied by the 
shareholder and the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income     
received by the Fund itself.                                                    

The Fund will mail reports containing information about the Fund's distributions
during the year to you after December 31st of each year (by January 31st).      

Consult your tax advisor about the Federal, state and local tax consequences in 
your particular circumstances.                                                  

Taxes On Sales Or Redemptions Of Shares - The sale of Fund shares is a taxable  
transaction for Federal income tax purposes. Selling shareholders of the Fund   
will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference      
between the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares sold and the amount  
received. If the shares are held as a capital asset, the gain or loss will be a 
capital gain or loss.                                                           

"Buying A Dividend" - All distributions reduce the NAV of the Fund's shares by  
the amount of the distribution. Unless your investment is in a tax-deferred     
account, you may wish to avoid buying shares of the Fund shortly before a       
distribution. If you do purchase shares prior to a distribution, you will pay   
the full pre-distribution price for your shares and then receive part of your   
investment back as a taxable distribution.                                      

Tax Withholding - By law, the Fund must withhold 28% of your taxable            
distribution and proceeds if you (1) have failed to provide a correct taxpayer  
identification number (TIN); (2) are subject to backup withholding by the       
Internal Revenue Service (IRS); (3) have failed to provide the Fund with the    
certifications required by the IRS to document that you are not subject to      
backup withholding; or (4) has failed to certify that he or she is a U.S. person
(including a U.S. resident alien).                                              

The foregoing briefly summarizes some of the important federal income tax       
consequences to shareholders of investing in the Fund's shares, reflects the    
federal tax law as of the date of this prospectus, and does not address special 
tax rules applicable to certain types of investors, such as corporate,          
tax-exempt and foreign investors. Investors should consult their tax advisers   
regarding other federal, state or local tax considerations that may be          
applicable in their particular circumstances, as well as any proposed tax law   
changes.                                                                        
 PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS

Advertisements and other sales literature may refer to the Fund's total return. 
The total return for the one, five and ten-year periods (or for the life of the 
Fund until the Fund is in existence for such longer periods) through the most   
recent calendar quarter represents the average annual compounded rate of return 
on an investment of $1,000 in the Fund invested at the public offering price.   
Total return may also be presented for other periods. All data is based on past 
investment results and do not predict future performance. Investment            
performance, which will vary, is based on many factors, including market        
conditions, portfolio composition and Fund operating expenses. Investment       
performance also often reflects the risks associated with the Fund's investment 
objective and strategies. These factors should be considered when comparing the 
Fund's investment results with those of other mutual funds and other investment 
vehicles.                                                                       

Quotations of investment performance for any period when an expense limitation  
is in effect will be greater than if the limitation had not been in effect. Fund
performance may be compared to that of various indexes.                         

Custodian - UMB Bank, N.A. (the "Custodian"), 928 Grand Blvd., 5th Floor, Kansas
City, Missouri 64106, serves as custodian for the Fund's cash and securities.   
The Custodian does not assist in, and is not responsible for, investment        
decisions involving assets of the Fund.

THE FUND

The Satuit Capital Small Cap Fund (the "Fund") is a series of Satuit Capital    
Management Trust (the "Trust"), a Delaware statutory trust organized on August
29, 2000. The Fund's principal office is located at 2807 Gaston Gate, Mt.
Pleasant, SC 29466. The Fund commenced operations on March 1, 2000 as a separate
portfolio of The World Funds, Inc. (the "Predecessor Fund"). The Fund was       
reorganized as a separate series of the Satuit Capital Management Trust on      
November 1, 2007. The Fund has the same investment strategy as the Predecessor  
Fund. However, prior to April 10, 2007, the Predecessor Fund's investment       
strategy was to invest at least 80% of the Fund's assets in genomics related    
issues. The Adviser was appointed as investment sub-adviser to the Predecessor  
Fund on January 15, 2003 and prior to such date had no affiliation with the     
Predecessor Fund. Accordingly, performance information related to the time      
period prior to April 10, 2007 represents the performance of the Predecessor    
Fund's former investment strategy and, for performance information related to   
the time period prior to January 15, 2003, the performance of the Predecessor   
Fund's former investment adviser.                                               

The Fund is a separate investment portfolio or series of the Trust. As of the   
date of this SAI, the Fund offers one class of shares to investors, Class Y     
shares. The Fund is authorized to issue four classes of shares: Class A shares  
imposing a front-end sales charge of up to a maximum of 5.75% and charging a    
distribution (i.e., 12b-1) fee; Class B shares charging a maximum contingent    
deferred sales charge of 5.00% if redeemed within six years of purchase,        
carrying a higher distribution (i.e., 12b-1) fee than Class A shares, but       
converting to Class A shares eight years after purchase; Class C shares,        
imposing no front-end sales charge, imposing a deferred sales charge of 2.00% if
shares are redeemed within two (2) years after purchase, and carrying a higher  
distribution (i.e., 12b-1) fee than Class A shares, with no conversion feature; 
and Class Y shares, which have no front-end sales charge, have a lower 12b-1 fee
than Class A shares and are only available to certain institutional investors   
and for shareholders who were shareholders in the Fund prior to or on the day   
the Fund began offering Class A and Class C shares. Each class of shares is     
substantially the same as they each represent interests in the same portfolio of
securities and differ only to the extent that they bear different expenses.     

 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES AND RESTRICTIONS

The Fund's investment objective is to provide investors with capital            
appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at
least 80% of its assets in a diversified portfolio of U.S. common stocks of     
small capitalization companies ("small-cap companies"). Satuit Capital          
Management, LLC (the "Adviser") considers a company to be a small-cap company   
when its market capitalization, at the time of purchase, is within the market   
capitalization range of companies in the Russell 2000(R) Index at reconstitution
each June ($261.8 million to $2.5 billion as of June 2007). The Adviser will    
select portfolio securities which the Adviser believes exhibit reasonable       
valuations and favorable growth prospects.                                      

Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets 
in equity securities of small-cap companies. This is not a fundamental policy   
and may be changed by the without a vote of shareholders, upon sixty (60) days' 
prior notice. The Fund's investment objective and fundamental investment        
restrictions may not be changed without approval by vote of a majority of the   
outstanding voting shares of the Fund, as defined by the 1940 Act. Unless       
otherwise noted, the policies described in this SAI are not fundamental and may 
be changed by the Board without shareholder approval.                           

The Adviser utilizes proprietary quantitative analysis of both value and growth 
characteristics to rank U.S. small-cap companies. Valuation and growth          
characteristics are equally weighted for purposes of ranking potential          
investments securities. Valuation analysis is used to determine the inherent    
value of the company and requires the analysis of financial information such as 
a company's price to book, price to sales, return on equity, and return on      
assets ratios. Growth analysis is used to determine a company's potential for   
long-term dividends and earnings growth as determined by market-oriented factors
such as market share, the launch of new products or services, the strength of   
its management and market demand. From these analyses, the Adviser ranks the    
companies that exhibit stable and growing valuation ratios and the most         
favorable dividends and earnings prospects and lists them on what it refers to  
as the "Focus List."                                                            

The Adviser selects portfolio securities for investment by the Fund by          
subjecting the common stocks on the Focus List to a qualitative analysis of each
company's valuation and growth characteristics in order to determine whether    
these characteristics are sustainable over the long term. Such analysis includes
a more detailed review of each company's competitive position in its particular 
market sector, its business prospects and financial statements. The Adviser also
regularly conducts interviews with company management and Wall Street analysts  
who provide research about a company's common stock in the stock market.        

The Adviser will constantly monitor the Fund's investment portfolio positions   
for adverse changes in the Fund's investment portfolio. Portfolio securities may
be sold as a result of adverse changes in the stock markets generally, or to a  
specific issuer, that results in poor relative performance. Portfolio securities
may also be sold if the Adviser determines that the valuation and growth        
characteristics that formed the basis for purchasing a stock no longer meet the 
criteria for portfolio securities of the Fund.                                  

The Adviser may elect to sell a portfolio security when the reasons for its     
purchase no longer apply, when return on assets, price to book value or other   
valuation ratios decline, when the Adviser believes that the market price per   
share of a security exceeds the inherent value of the company, or when a        
company's earnings and dividends prospects weaken.                              

INVESTING IN MUTUAL FUNDS - All mutual funds carry a certain amount of risk. You
may lose money on your investment in the Fund. As all investment securities are 
subject to inherent market risks and fluctuations in value due to earnings,     
economic and political conditions and other factors, the Fund can give no       
assurance that its investment objective will be achieved.                       

STOCK MARKET RISKS - The net asset value of the Fund will fluctuate based on    
changes in the value of the securities held in the investment portfolio. The    
stock market is generally susceptible to volatile fluctuations in market price. 
Market prices of securities in which the Fund invests may be adversely affected 
by an issuer's having experienced losses or by the lack of earnings or by the   
issuer's failure to meet the market's expectations with respect to new products 
or services, or even by factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of   
the issuer. The value of the securities held by the Fund is also subject to the 
risk that a specific segment of the stock market does not perform as well as the
overall market. Under any of these circumstances, the value of the Fund's shares
and total return will fluctuate, and your investment may be worth more or less  
than your original cost when you redeem your shares.                            

STOCK SELECTION RISKS - Like all managed funds, there is a risk that the        
Adviser's strategy for managing the Fund may not achieve the desired results.   
The portfolio securities selected by the Adviser may decline in value or not    
increase in value when the stock market in general is rising and may fail to    
meet the Fund's investment objective. In addition, the price of common stock    
moves up and down in response to corporate earnings and developments, economic  
and market conditions and anticipated events. As a result, the price of the     
Fund's investments may go down and you could lose money on your investment.     

INVESTMENT IN SMALL-CAP COMPANIES - The Fund invests principally in companies   
with small market capitalization or companies that have relatively small        
revenues, limited product lines, and a small share of the market for their      
products or services (collectively, "small companies"). Small companies are also
characterized by the following: (i) they may lack depth of management; (ii) they
may be unable to internally generate funds necessary for growth or potential    
development or to generate such funds through external financing on favorable   
terms; and (iii) they may be developing or marketing new products or services   
for which markets are not yet established and may never become established. Due 
to these and other factors, small companies may suffer significant losses, as   
well as realize substantial growth. Thus, securities of small companies present 
greater risks than securities of larger, more established companies. If the Fund
is heavily invested in these securities, the NAV of the Fund will be more       
susceptible to sudden and significant losses if the value of these securities   
decline.                                                                        

Historically, stocks of small companies have been more volatile than stocks of  
larger companies and are, therefore, more speculative than investments in larger
companies. Among the reasons for the greater price volatility are the following:
(i) the less certain growth prospects of smaller companies; (ii) the lower      
degree of liquidity in the markets for such stocks; and (iii) the greater       
sensitivity of small companies to changing economic conditions. Besides         
exhibiting greater volatility, small company stocks may, to a degree, fluctuate 
independently of larger company stocks. Small company stocks may decline in     
price as large company stocks rise, or rise in price as large company stocks    
decline. To the extent that securities of small companies are not liquid, the   
Fund will limit its investments in such securities to not more than 15% its of  
assets. You should expect that the value of Fund shares may be more volatile    
than the shares of a mutual fund investing primarily in larger company stocks.  

INVESTMENT IN MICRO-CAP COMPANIES - Certain of the Fund's investments may be    
considered investments in micro-cap companies (companies with a market          
capitalization of between $200 million and $500 million). Accordingly, the Fund 
may be subject to the additional risks associated with investment in companies  
with micro capital structures. These companies may (i) have relatively small    
revenues, (ii) have limited product lines or services, (iii) lack depth of      
management, (iv) lack the ability to obtain funds necessary for growth, and (v) 
feature products or services for which a market does not yet exist and/or may   
ever be established. The increased risk involved with investing in micro-cap    
companies may cause the market prices of their securities to be more volatile   
than those of larger, more established companies. Further, these securities tend
to trade at a lower volume than do those of larger, more established companies. 
If the Fund is heavily invested in these securities and the value of these      
securities suddenly decline, the NAV of the Fund will be more susceptible to    
sudden and significant losses.                                                  

OTHER INVESTMENT POLICIES AND RESTRICTIONS - The following paragraphs provide a 
description of other investment policies and restrictions of the Fund. Unless   
otherwise noted, the policies described in this SAI are not fundamental and may 
be changed by the Board without shareholder approval.                           

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS - To the extent that IPOs are offered to the Fund, the 
Fund may participate in IPOs if the security being offered satisfies the Fund's 
investment criteria as determined by the Adviser. An IPO, initial public        
offering, is a company's first sale of stock to the public and are primarily    
used to raise substantial amounts of new capital to support current operations, 
expansion or new business opportunities and otherwise to implement a company's  
growth plans. Securities offered in an IPO are often, but not always, those of  
young, small companies seeking outside equity capital and a public market for   
their stock. There is no guarantee that the company offering its shares in a    
public offering will sell a sufficient amount of shares to raise the capital    
that is needed or that a public market for their shares will ever develop.      
Investors purchasing stock in IPOs generally must be prepared to accept         
considerable risks for the possibility of large gains. IPOs by investment       
companies (closed-end funds) usually include underwriting fees that represent a 
load to buyers. IPOs are considered speculative investments and can be extremely
volatile. As a result, IPOs may have a significant impact on the Fund's         
performance. There is no guarantee that the IPOs in which the Fund participates 
will be successful, or that the Fund will have access to successful IPOs. In    
addition, as Fund assets grow, the positive impact of successful IPOs on Fund   
performance will decrease.                                                      

CASH POSITIONS AND TEMPORARY DEFENSIVE STRATEGIES - At times, the Fund may      
employ temporary defensive strategies in response to unfavorable economic,      
market, political or other conditions. At such times, the Fund may increase its 
cash reserves without limit by holding high quality, short-term debt securities 
and money market instruments and by entering into repurchase agreements. These  
investments are inconsistent with the Fund's primary investment strategies. As a
result, during these periods, the Fund may not achieve its objective.           

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS - The Fund may invest in any of the following securities 
and instruments:                                                                

BANK CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, BANKERS' ACCEPTANCES AND TIME DEPOSITS - The Fund 
may acquire certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances and time deposits.    
Certificates of deposit are negotiable certificates issued against funds        
deposited in a commercial bank for a definite period of time and earning a      
specified return. Bankers' acceptances are negotiable drafts or bills of        
exchange, normally drawn by an importer or exporter to pay for specific         
merchandise, which are "accepted" by a bank, meaning in effect that the bank    
unconditionally agrees to pay the face value of the instrument on maturity.     
Certificates of deposit and bankers' acceptances acquired by the Fund will be   
dollar-denominated obligations of domestic banks or financial institutions which
at the time of purchase have capital, surplus and undivided profits in excess of
$100 million (including assets of both domestic and foreign branches), based on 
latest published reports, or less than $100 million if the principal amount of  
such bank obligations are fully insured by the U.S. Government.                 

Banks may be subject to different governmental regulations with respect to the  
amount and types of loans which may be made and interest rates which may be     
charged. In addition, the profitability of the banking industry depends largely 
upon the availability and cost of funds for the purpose of financing lending    
operations under prevailing money market conditions. General economic           
conditions, as well as exposure to credit losses arising from possible financial
difficulties of borrowers, play an important part in the operations of the      
banking industry.                                                               

As a result of federal and state laws and regulations, banks are, among other   
things, required to maintain specified levels of reserves, limited in the amount
which they can loan to a single borrower, and subject to other regulations      
designed to promote financial soundness.                                        

In addition to purchasing certificates of deposit and bankers' acceptances, to  
the extent permitted under its investment objective, strategies and policies    
stated above and in its Prospectus, the Fund may make interest-bearing time or  
other interest-bearing deposits in commercial or savings banks. Time deposits   
are non-negotiable deposits maintained at a banking institution for a specified 
period of time at a specified interest rate.                                    

SAVINGS ASSOCIATION OBLIGATIONS - The Fund may invest in certificates of deposit
(interest-bearing time deposits) issued by savings banks or savings and loan    
associations that have capital, surplus and undivided profits in excess of $100 
million, based on latest published reports, or less than $100 million if the    
principal amount of such obligations is fully insured by the U.S. Government.   

COMMERCIAL PAPER, SHORT-TERM NOTES AND OTHER CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS - The Fund   
may invest a portion of its assets in commercial paper and short-term notes.    
Commercial paper consists of unsecured promissory notes issued by corporations. 
Issues of commercial paper and short-term notes will normally have maturities of
less than nine months and fixed rates of return, although such instruments may  
have maturities of up to one year.                                              

Commercial paper and short-term notes will consist of issues rated at the time  
of purchase "A-2" or higher by S&P, "Prime-1" or "Prime-2" by Moody's, or       
similarly rated by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization
or, if unrated, will be determined by Satuit Capital Management, LLC (the       
"Adviser") to be of comparable quality.                                         

Corporate obligations include bonds and notes issued by corporations to finance 
longer-term credit needs that could not be supported by commercial paper. While 
such obligations generally have maturities of ten years or more, the Fund may   
purchase corporate obligations which have remaining maturities of one year or   
less from the date of purchase and which are rated "AA" or higher by S&P or "Aa"
or higher by Moody's.                                                           

GOVERNMENT  OBLIGATIONS - The Fund may make short-term  investments in U.S.     
Government obligations. Such obligations include Treasury bills, certificates of
indebtedness,  notes and bonds,  and issues of such  entities as the  Government
National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), Export-Import Bank of the United States,
Tennessee  Valley  Authority,  Resolution  Funding  Corporation,   Farmers  Home
Administration,  Federal Home Loan Banks,  Federal  Intermediate  Credit  Banks,
Federal Farm Credit Banks, Federal Land Banks,  Federal Housing  Administration,
Federal  National  Mortgage  Association  ("FNMA"),  Federal Home Loan  Mortgage
Corporation, and the Student Loan Marketing Association.                        

Each of these obligations, such as those of the GNMA, are supported by the full 
faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury; others, such as those of the             
Export-Import Bank of United States, are supported by the right of the issuer to
borrow from the Treasury; others, such as those of the FNMA, are supported by   
the discretionary authority of the U.S. Government to purchase the agency's     
obligations; still others, such as those of the Student Loan Marketing          
Association, are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality. No        
assurance can be given that the U.S. Government would provide financial support 
to U.S. Government-sponsored instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so  
by law.                                                                         

ILLIQUID SECURITIES - The Fund may not invest more than 15% of the value of its 
net assets in securities that at the time of purchase are illiquid. The Adviser 
will monitor the amount of illiquid securities in the Fund's portfolio, under   
the supervision of the Board, to ensure compliance with the Fund's investment   
restrictions.                                                                   

Historically, illiquid securities have included securities subject to           
contractual or legal restrictions on resale because they have not been          
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), securities  
which are otherwise not readily marketable and repurchase agreements having a   
maturity of longer than seven days. Securities which have not been registered   
under the Securities Act are referred to as private placement or restricted     
securities and are purchased directly from the issuer or in the secondary       
market. Mutual funds do not typically hold a significant amount of these        
restricted or other illiquid securities because of the potential for delays on  
resale and uncertainty in valuation. Limitations on resale may have an adverse  
effect on the marketability of the Fund's portfolio securities and the Fund     
might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid securities promptly  
or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying      
redemption requests within seven days. The Fund might also have to register such
restricted securities in order to dispose of them, resulting in additional      
expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering
of securities.                                                                  

In recent years, however, a large institutional market has developed for certain
securities that are not registered under the Securities Act, including          
repurchase agreements, commercial paper, municipal securities and corporate     
bonds and notes. Institutional investors depend on an efficient institutional   
market in which the unregistered security can be readily resold or on an        
issuer's ability to honor a demand for repayment. The fact that there are       
contractual or legal restrictions on resale to the general public or to certain 
institutions may not be indicative of the liquidity of such investments. If such
securities are subject to purchase by institutional buyers in accordance with   
Rule 144A promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act, the Board may 
determine that such securities are not illiquid securities notwithstanding their
legal or contractual restrictions on resale. In all other cases, however,       
securities subject to restrictions on resale will be deemed illiquid.           

RESTRICTED SECURITIES - The SEC Staff currently takes the view that any         
delegation by the Board of the authority to determine that a restricted security
is readily marketable (as described in the investment restrictions of the Fund) 
must be pursuant to written procedures established by the Board. It is the      
present intention of the Board, if the Board decides to delegate such           
determinations to the Adviser or another person, they would do so pursuant to   
written procedures, consistent with the Staff's position. Should the Staff      
modify its position in the future, the Board would consider what action would be
appropriate in light of the Staff's position at that time.                      

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements. A         
repurchase agreement involves the purchase by the Fund of the securities with   
the condition that after a stated period of time the original seller will buy   
back the same securities at a predetermined price or yield. The Fund's custodian
will hold the securities underlying any repurchase agreement or such securities 
will be part of the Federal Reserve Book Entry System. The market value of the  
collateral underlying the repurchase Agreement will be determined on each       
business day. If at any time the market value of the Fund's collateral falls    
below the repurchase price of the repurchase agreement (including any accrued   
interest), the Fund will promptly receive additional collateral (so the total   
collateral is an amount at least equal to the repurchase price plus accrued     
interest).                                                                      

BORROWING MONEY - Except as specified below, the Fund may only borrow money for 
temporary or emergency purposes and then only in an amount not in excess of 5%  
of the lower of value or cost of its total assets, in which case the Fund may   
pledge, mortgage or hypothecate any of its assets as security for such borrowing
but not to an extent greater than 5% of its total assets. The Fund may borrow up
to one-third of its total assets to avoid the untimely disposition of assets to 
meet redemptions, in an amount up to 33-1/3% of the value of its assets,        
provided that the Fund maintains asset coverage of 300% in connection with      
borrowings, and the Fund does not make other investments while such borrowings  
are outstanding. Borrowing money involves special risk considerations that may  
not be associated with other funds having similar objectives and policies.      
Because substantially all of the Fund's assets fluctuate in value, whereas the  
interest obligation resulting from a borrowing is generally fixed, the net asset
value per share of the Fund tends to decrease more when its portfolio assets    
decrease in value than would otherwise occur if the Fund did not borrow funds.  
Interest costs on borrowings, however, may fluctuate with changing market rates 
of interest and may partially offset or exceed the return earned on borrowed    
funds. Under adverse market conditions, the Fund might have to sell portfolio   
securities to meet interest or principal payments at a time when fundamental    
investment considerations would not favor such sales.                           

INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS - In addition to the principal investment objectives,   
policies and risks set forth in the Prospectus and in this SAI, the Fund is     
subject to certain fundamental and non-fundamental investment restrictions, as  
set forth below. Fundamental investment restrictions may not be changed without 
the vote of a majority of the Fund's outstanding securities, as defined in the  
1940 Act. Non-fundamental investment restrictions of the Fund may be changed by 
the Board.                                                                      

FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 

As fundamental investment restrictions, the Fund will not:                      

1.    Invest in companies for the purpose of exercising management or control;  

2.    Invest in securities of other investment companies except by purchase in  
     the open market involving only customary broker's commissions, or as part
of a merger, consolidation, or acquisition of assets;               

3.    Purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts;                      

4.    Invest in interests in oil, gas, or other mineral exploration or          
development programs;                                               

5.    Purchase securities on margin, except for use of short-term credits as    
necessary for the clearance of purchase of portfolio securities;    

6.    Issue senior securities, (except the Fund may engage in transactions such 
as those permitted by SEC release IC-10666);                        

7.    Act as an underwriter of securities of other issuers,  except             
that the Fund may  invest up to 10% of the value of its total       
assets (at the time of  investment)  in portfolio  securities       
which  the  Fund  might  not be free  to  sell to the  public       
without  registration of such securities under the Securities       
Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"),  or any foreign law       
restricting  distribution  of  securities  in a country  of a       
foreign issuer;                                                     

8.    Participate on a joint or a joint and several basis in any securities     
trading account;                                                    

9.    Engage in short sales;                                                    

10.   Purchase or sell real estate, provided that liquid securities of companies
    which deal in real estate or interests therein would not be deemed to be
an investment in real estate;                                       

11.  Purchase the securities of any issuer (other than  obligations  issued     
or   guaranteed   by   the   U.S.   Government,    its   agencies   or
instrumentalities)  if, as a  result,  as to 75% of the  Fund's  total
assets,  more  than 5% of its net  assets  would  be  invested  in the
securities  of one  issuer or the Fund would hold more than 10% of the
outstanding voting securities of any one issuer.                      

12.   Make loans;                                                               

13.   Except as specified below, the Fund may only borrow money                 
for temporary or emergency purposes and then only in an             
amount not in excess of 5% of the lower of value or cost of         
its total assets, in which case the Fund may pledge,                
mortgage or hypothecate any of its assets as security for           
such borrowing but not to an extent greater than 5% of its          
total assets. The Fund may borrow money to avoid the                
untimely disposition of assets to meet redemptions, in an           
amount up to 33-1/3% of the value of its assets, provided           
that the Fund maintains asset coverage of 300% in connection        
with borrowings, and the Fund does not make other                   
investments while such borrowings are outstanding.                  

14.   The Fund may not concentrate investments in a particular industry or group
    of industries, as concentration is defined under the 1940 Act, the rules
   and regulations thereunder or any exemption therefrom, as such statute,
 rules or regulations may be amended or interpreted from time to time.

In applying its investment policies and restrictions, except with respect to the
Fund's investment restriction concerning borrowing, percentage restriction on   
investment or utilization of assets is determined at the time an investment is  
made. A later change in percentage resulting from changes in the value or the   
total cost of the Fund's assets will not be considered a violation of the       
restriction.                                                                    

NON-FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 

The Fund is subject to the following restrictions that are not fundamental and  
may therefore be changed by the Board without shareholder approval.             

The Fund will not:                                                              

1. Invest more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities;               

2. Engage in arbitrage transactions; or                                         

3. Purchase or sell options.                                                    

Unless otherwise indicated, percentage limitations included in the restrictions 
apply at the time the Fund enters into a transaction. Accordingly, any later    
increase or decrease beyond the specified limitation resulting from a change in 
the Fund's net assets will not be considered in determining whether its has     
complied with its investment restrictions.                                      

DISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES HOLDINGS             

The Trust maintains written policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of 
its portfolio holdings to ensure that disclosure of information about portfolio 
securities is in the best interests of the Fund's shareholders. The Board       
reviews these policies and procedures on an annual basis. Compliance will be    
periodically assessed by the Board in connection with a report from the Trust's 
Chief Compliance Officer. In addition, the Board has reviewed and approved the  
list below of entities that may receive portfolio holdings information prior to 
and more frequently than the public disclosure of such information (i.e.,       
"non-standard disclosure"). The Board has also delegated authority to the       
Trust's President and to senior management at the Trust's administrator,        
Commonwealth Shareholder Services, Inc. ("CSS"), to provide such information in 
certain circumstances (see below). The Board is notified of, and reviews any    
requests for non-standard disclosure approved by the Trust's President and/or   
senior management at CSS. CSS reports quarterly to the Board regarding the      
implementation of such policies and procedures.                                 

The Trust is required by the SEC to file its complete portfolio holdings        
schedule with the SEC on a quarterly basis. This schedule is filed with the     
Trust's annual and semi-annual reports on Form N-CSR for the second and fourth  
fiscal quarters and on Form N-Q for the first and third fiscal quarters. The    
portfolio holdings information provided in these reports is as of the end of the
quarter in question. Form N-CSR must be filed with the SEC no later than ten    
(10) calendar days after the Trust transmits its annual or semi-annual report to
its shareholders. Form N-Q must be filed with the SEC no later than sixty (60)  
calendar days after the end of the applicable quarter.                          

The Trust's service providers which have contracted to provide services to the  
Trust and its funds, including, for example, the custodian and the Fund         
accountants, and which require portfolio holdings information in order to       
perform those services, may receive non-standard disclosure. Non-standard       
disclosure of portfolio holdings information may also be provided to a          
third-party when the Trust has a legitimate business purpose for doing so. The  
Trust has the following ongoing arrangements with certain third parties to      
provide the Fund's full portfolio holdings:                                     

1.    to the Trust's auditors within sixty (60) days after the applicable fiscal
period for use in providing audit opinions;                         

2.    to financial printers within sixty (60) days after the applicable fiscal  
period for the purpose of preparing regulatory filings;             

3.    to rating agencies on a monthly basis for use in developing a rating for  
the Fund; and                                                       

4.    to the Trust's administrator, custodian, transfer agent and accounting    
 services provider on a daily basis in connection with their providing
services to the Fund.                                               

The Trust currently has no other arrangements for the provision of non-standard 
disclosure to any party or shareholder.                                         

Other than the non-standard disclosure discussed above, if a third-party        
requests specific, current information regarding the Fund's portfolio holdings, 
the Trust will refer the third-party to the latest regulatory filing.           

Non-standard disclosure of portfolio holdings may only be made pursuant to a    
written request that has been approved by the Board. The Board has authorized   
the President of the Trust and senior management at CSS to consider and approve 
such written requests for non-standard disclosure; provided that, they promptly 
report any such approval to the Board.                                          

All of the arrangements above are subject to the policies and procedures adopted
by the Board to ensure such disclosure is for a legitimate business purpose and 
is in the best interests of a Trust and its shareholders. There may be instances
where the interests of the Trust's shareholders respecting the disclosure of    
information about portfolio holdings may conflict or appear to conflict with the
interests of the Fund's investment adviser, any principal underwriter for the   
Trust or an affiliated person of the Trust (including such affiliated person's  
investment adviser or principal underwriter). In such situations, the conflict  
must be disclosed to the Board, and the Board must be afforded the opportunity  
to determine whether or not to allow such disclosure.                           

Affiliated persons of the Trust who receive non-standard disclosure are subject 
to restrictions and limitations on the use and handling of such information     
pursuant to a Code of Ethics, including requirements to maintain the            
confidentiality of such information, pre-clear securities trades and report     
securities transactions activity, as applicable. Affiliated persons of the Trust
and third party service providers of the Trust receiving such non-standard      
disclosure will be instructed that such information must be kept confidential   
and that no trading on such information should be allowed.                      

Neither the Trust nor its investment adviser or any affiliate thereof receives  
compensation or other consideration in connection with the non-standard         
disclosure of information about portfolio securities.

the  Trust,  as that term is  defined  in the 1940  Act.  Mr.

officer  of  the  Trust;  and  (2)  he is  the  owner  of the       
investment adviser to the Fund.

Trust's next meeting of shareholders and the election and qualification of his  
successor; or until the date a trustee dies, resigns or is removed in accordance
with the Trust's Declaration of Trust and By-laws. Each officer holds office at 
the pleasure of the Board and serves for a period of one year, or until his     
successor is duly elected and qualified.

the independent auditors with respect to the Trust's management practices,      
review the impact of changes in accounting standards on the Trust's financial   
statements, recommend to the Board the selection of independent auditors, and

evaluation and recommendation of changes to the Trust's policies and procedures,
including any changes (if necessary) to the Trust's Articles or By-Laws,        
relating to corporate governance. The Governance and Nominating Committee is    
also responsible for corporate governance and the selection and nomination of   
candidates to serve as trustees of the Trust. Although the Governance and       
Nominating Committee expects to be able to find an adequate number of qualified 
candidates to serve as trustees, the Governance and Nominating Committee is     
willing to consider nominations received from shareholders. Shareholders wishing
to submit a nomination should do so by notifying the Secretary of the Trust, in

* "Interested person" as defined under the 1940 Act. ** The Fund was reorganized
as a separate series of Satuit Capital Management Trust on November 1, 2007;    
therefore, no compensation was paid to the Trustees from the Fund for fiscal    
year ended August 31, 2006.                                                     

*** Amounts reflect compensation paid to the Trustees for Satuit Capital Micro  
Cap Fund, the other registered mutual fund in the fund complex, for the fiscal  
year ended October 31, 2006, which is Satuit Capital Micro Cap Fund's fiscal    
year end.                                                                       

CODE OF ETHICS - The Trust, the Adviser and the Distributor have each adopted a 
Code of Ethics (the "Code"), pursuant to Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act, which makes
it unlawful for any affiliated person of the Fund, Adviser, or Distributor, in  
connection with the purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, by the person, of 
a security held or to be acquired by the Fund to (i) employ any device, scheme  
or artifice to defraud the Fund; (ii) make any untrue statement of a material   
fact to the Fund or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made to the Fund, in light of the circumstances under which they are 
made, not misleading; (iii) engage in any act, practice or course of business   
that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the Fund; or (iv) engage 
in any manipulative practice with respect to the Fund. The Board has determined 
that personnel of the Trust may engage in personal trading of securities,       
including with respect to securities purchased and sold by the Fund, subject to 
general fiduciary principles and compliance with the express provisions of the  
Code.                                                                           

It is noted that under the Code: (1) the disinterested Trustees of the Trust are
not required to pre-clear personal securities transactions, and (2) the         
disinterested Trustees need not report transactions where they were not provided
with information about the portfolio transactions contemplated for the Fund or  
executed for the Fund for a period of 15 days before and after such             
transactions.                                                                   

PROXY VOTING POLICIES - The Trust is required to disclose information concerning
the Fund's proxy voting policies and procedures to shareholders. The Board has  
delegated to the Adviser responsibility for decisions regarding proxy voting for
securities held by the Fund. The Adviser will vote such proxies in accordance   
with its proxy policies and procedures, which have been reviewed by the Board,  
and which are found in Appendix A. Any material changes to the proxy policies   
and procedures will be submitted to the Board for approval. Information         
regarding how the Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio securities for the   
most recent 12-month period ending June 30 of each year will be available (1)   
without charge, upon request by calling 800-567-4030 and (2) on the SEC's       
website at http://www.sec.gov. Where a proxy proposal raises a material conflict
between the Adviser's interests and a client's interest, including a mutual fund
client, the Adviser will resolve such a conflict in the manner set forth in its 
Proxy and Corporate Action Voting Policies and Procedures set forth in Appendix 
A.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES 

THE ADVISER - Satuit Capital Management LLC, 2807 Gaston Gate, Mt. Pleasant,    
South Carolina 29466, serves as investment adviser to the Fund. The Adviser is  
owned and controlled by Mr. Robert J. Sullivan, who is also the Managing        
Director and Chief Investment Officer of the Adviser. Subject to the general    
supervision and control of the Board, the Adviser makes investment decisions for
the Fund. The Adviser is a privately held limited liability company that is     
registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. John Pasco, III, owner of the 
principal underwriter of the Fund, owns an interest in the Adviser through      
Commonwealth Capital Management, LLC.                                           

Under the terms of its Advisory Agreement with the Fund, the Adviser is         
responsible for formulating the Fund's investment programs and for making       
day-to-day investment decisions and engaging in portfolio transactions. The     
Adviser also furnishes corporate officers, provides office space, services and  
equipment and supervises all matters relating to the Fund's operations. The     
Adviser pays all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities      
thereunder, except the cost of securities (including brokerage commissions, if  
any) purchased for the Fund. The services furnished by the Adviser under the    
Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to perform similar
services for others.                                                            

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT - The Adviser acts as the investment adviser to   
the Fund pursuant to an Advisory Agreement which has been approved by the Board 
(including a majority of the Trustees who are not parties to the agreement, or  
interested persons of any such party). Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Adviser, the Adviser conducts investment research and 
management for the Fund and is responsible for the purchase and sale of         
securities for the Fund's investment portfolio. The Adviser provides the Fund   
with investment advice, supervises the management and investment programs and   
provides investment advisory facilities and executive and supervisory personnel 
for managing the investments and effectuating portfolio transactions. The       
Adviser also furnishes, at its own expense, all necessary administrative        
services, office space, equipment and clerical personnel for servicing the      
investments of the Fund. In addition, the Adviser pays the salaries and fees of 
all officers of the Trust who are affiliated with the Adviser.                  

The Advisory Agreement remains in effect initially for a two year term and      
continues in effect thereafter only if such continuance is specifically approved
at least annually by the Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding   
voting securities of the Fund (as defined in the 1940 Act) and, in either case, 
by a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust or the
Adviser. The Adviser's investment decisions are made subject to the direction   
and supervision of the Board. The Advisory Agreement provides that the Adviser  
shall not be liable to the Fund for any error of judgment by the Adviser or for 
any loss sustained by the Fund except in the case of the Adviser's willful      
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duty. The     
Advisory Agreement also provides that it shall terminate automatically if       
assigned and that it may be terminated without penalty by vote of a majority of 
the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or by either party upon 60 days'  
written notice. No person other than the Adviser regularly furnishes advice to  
the Fund with respect to the desirability of the Fund's investing in, purchasing
or selling securities.                                                          

In the interest of limiting expenses of the Fund, the Adviser has assumed the   
obligations of the Predecessor Fund's investment adviser, Commonwealth Capital  
Management, LLC (the "Predecessor Adviser") under the Predecessor Fund's Expense
Limitation Agreement. The assumption of the Predecessor Adviser's obligations   
was accomplished through an Assignment and Assumption Agreement that was entered
into between the Adviser, the Predecessor Adviser, the Fund and the Predecessor 
Fund. Pursuant to the Expense Limitation Agreement, the Adviser has agreed to   
waive or limit its fees and to assume other expenses of the Fund until August
31, 2008 so that the ratio of total annual operating expenses for the Fund's    
Class Y shares is limited to 1.90%. The Assignment and Assumption Agreement also
provides that the Predecessor Adviser will continue to be entitled to the       
reimbursement of fees waived or reimbursed by the Predecessor Adviser for a     
period of five years following the Fund's reorganization into the Trust. The    
Adviser will also be entitled to the reimbursement of fees waived or reimbursed 
by the Adviser to the Fund for five years following such waiver or              
reimbursement, provided that the Predecessor Adviser has received all applicable
recoupment. The total amount of reimbursement recoverable by the Predecessor    
Adviser or the Adviser is the sum of all fees previously waived or reimbursed by
the Predecessor Adviser or the Adviser, as applicable, less any reimbursement   
previously paid.                                                                

For the fiscal year ended August 31,2007, the Predecessor Adviser earned and    
waived $46,922 in advisory fees and reimbursed expenses of $153,170. For the    
year ended August 31, 2006, the Predecessor Adviser earned and waived $51,994 in
advisory fees and reimbursed expenses of $54,750. For the year ended August 31,
2005, the Predecessor Adviser waived fees and reimbursed expenses of $114,816.  

The total amount of recoverable reimbursements by the Predecessor Adviser as of 
August 31, 2007 was $651,339, which expires as follows:

suitability, taking into account the Fund's investment objective and other      
comparable investment opportunities.

Conflicts of Interest                                                           

The Adviser does not believe that any conflicts exist between Mr. Sullivan's    
portfolio management of the Fund and his management of the Satuit Capital Micro 
Cap Fund, a series of shares offered by the Trust (the "Micro Cap Fund").       

Mr. Sullivan believes that his management of both the Fund and the Micro Cap    
Fund (collectively, the "Funds") benefits each fund because of the significant  
overlap of investment opportunities of the Funds.                               

The Funds share identical investment objectives using similar investment        
strategies. Mr. Sullivan may determine that an investment opportunity may be    
appropriate for only one of the Funds. If, however, an investment opportunity   
exists for both Funds, the Funds will be allocated their pro rata share of the  
opportunity until the position is completed. The Advisor feels that utilizing a 
pro rata share approach eliminates any conflict of interest. Further, in the    
event the Advisor decides to sell a position from a fund, in general, the       
position is sold from both Funds on a pro rata basis. The Advisor feels that the
pro rata approach eliminates any conflicts of interest.                         

If potential conflicts of interest arise because Mr. Sullivan shares in the     
day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to both the Fund and the    
Micro Cap Fund, Mr. Sullivan will use good faith efforts so that the Fund will  
not be treated materially less favorably than the Micro Cap Fund.

position reports.                                                               

CFA also monitors periodic distributions of gains or losses on portfolio sales  
and maintains a daily listing of portfolio holdings. CFA is responsible for     
providing expenses accrued and payment reporting services, tax-related financial
information to the Trust, and for monitoring compliance with the regulatory     
requirements relating to maintaining accounting records. For its services as    
accounting agent, CFA receives an asset-based fee, computed daily and paid      
monthly of the average daily net assets of the Fund against a minimum fee plus  
out-of-pocket expenses.                                                         

TRANSFER AGENT AND DIVIDEND DISBURSING AGENT - Pursuant to a Transfer Agent     
Agreement with the Trust, Fund Services, Inc. ("FSI" or the "Transfer Agent")   
acts as the Fund's transfer and disbursing agent. FSI is located at 8730 Stony  
Point Parkway, Suite 205, Richmond, Virginia 23235.                             

FSI provides certain shareholder and other services to the Trust, including     
furnishing account and transaction information and maintaining shareholder      
account records. FSI is responsible for processing orders and payments for share
purchases. FSI mails proxy materials (and receives and tabulates proxies),      
shareholder reports, confirmation forms for purchases and redemptions and       
prospectuses to shareholders. FSI disburses income dividends and capital        
distributions and prepares and files appropriate tax-related information        
concerning dividends and distributions to shareholders. For its services as     
transfer agent, FSI receives an asset-based fee, computed daily and paid monthly
of the average daily net assets of the Fund against a minimum fee plus          
out-of-pocket expenses.                                                         

DISTRIBUTOR - First Dominion Capital Corp. ("FDCC" or the "Distributor"),       
located at 8730 Stony Point Parkway, Suite 205, Richmond, Virginia 23235, serves
as the principal underwriter and national distributor for the shares of the Fund
pursuant to a Distribution Agreement (the "Distribution Agreement"). FDCC is    
registered as a broker-dealer and is a member of the National Association of    
Securities Dealers, Inc. The offering of the Fund's shares is continuous. The   
Distributor is also entitled to the payment of deferred sales charges upon the  
redemption of Class Y shares within three hundred and sixty (360) days of       
purchase as described in the prospectus and this SAI. In addition, the          
Distributor may receive Distribution 12b-1 and Service Fees from the Fund as    
described in the prospectus and this SAI.                                       

The Distributor received the following compensation as a result of the sale of  
the Predecessor Fund's shares:

OTHER EXPENSES - The Fund pays certain operating expenses that are not assumed  
by the Adviser, the Trust or any of their respective affiliates. These expenses,
together with fees paid to the Adviser, the Administrator, the Custodian, the   
Distributor and the Transfer Agent, are deducted from the income of the Fund    
before dividends are paid. These expenses include, but are not limited to,      
expenses of officers and Trustees who are not affiliated with the Adviser, the  
Trust or any of their respective affiliates, taxes, interest, legal fees,       
custodian fees, audit fees, brokerage fees and commissions, the expenses of     
reports to shareholders, shareholders' meetings and proxy solicitations.        

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS AND ALLOCATION OF BROKERAGE 

The Fund's assets are invested by the Adviser in a manner consistent with its   
investment objective, policies, and restrictions, and with any instructions the 
Board may issue from time to time. Within this framework, the Adviser is        
responsible for making all determinations as to the purchase and sale of        
portfolio securities and for taking all steps necessary to implement securities 
transactions on behalf of the Fund.                                             

U.S. Government securities generally are traded in the over-the-counter market  
through broker-dealers. A broker-dealer is a securities firm or bank that makes 
a market for securities by offering to buy at one price and sell at a slightly  
higher price. The difference between the prices is known as a spread.           

In placing orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the     
Fund, the Adviser will use its best efforts to obtain the best possible price   
and execution and will otherwise place orders with broker-dealers subject to,   
and in accordance with, any instructions the Board may issue from time to time. 
The Adviser will select broker-dealers to execute portfolio transactions on     
behalf of the Fund primarily on the basis of best price and execution.          

When consistent with the objectives of prompt execution and favorable net price,
business may be placed with broker-dealers who furnish investment research or   
services to the Adviser. Such research or services include advice, both directly
and in writing, as to the value of securities; the advisability of investing in,
purchasing or selling securities; the availability of securities, or purchasers 
or sellers of securities; as well as analyses and reports concerning issues,    
industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and the 
performance of accounts. To the extent portfolio transactions are effected with 
broker-dealers who furnish research services to the Adviser, the Adviser        
receives a benefit, not capable of evaluation in dollar amounts, without        
providing any direct monetary benefit to the Fund from these transactions. The  
Adviser believes that most research services obtained by it generally benefit   
several or all of the investment companies and private accounts that it manages,
as opposed to solely benefiting one specific managed fund or account.           

Transactions on U.S. stock exchanges, commodities markets and futures markets   
and other agency transactions involve the payment by the Fund of negotiated     
brokerage commissions. Such commissions vary among different brokers. A         
particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as 
the difficulty and size of the transaction. There is generally no stated        
commission in the case of securities traded in the over-the-counter markets, but
the price paid by the Fund usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or 
mark-up. In underwritten offerings, the price paid by the Fund includes a       
disclosed, fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer.  

It has for many years been a common practice in the investment advisory business
for advisers of investment companies and other institutional investors to       
receive brokerage and research services (as defined in the Securities Exchange  
Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) from broker-dealers that execute      
portfolio transactions for the clients of such advisers and from third parties  
with which such broker-dealers have arrangements. Consistent with this practice,
the Adviser may receive brokerage and research services and other similar       
services from many broker-dealers with which the Adviser may place the Fund's   
portfolio transactions and from third parties with which these broker-dealers   
have arrangements. These services include such matters as general economic and  
market reviews, industry and company reviews, evaluations of investments,       
recommendations as to the purchase and sale of investments, newspapers,         
magazines, pricing services, quotation services, news services and personal     
computers utilized by the Adviser. Where the services referred to above are not 
used exclusively by the Adviser for research purposes, the Adviser, based upon  
its own allocations of expected use, bears that portion of the cost of these    
services which directly relates to their non-research use. Some of these        
services are of value to the Adviser and its affiliates in advising a variety of
their clients (including the Fund), although not all of these services are      
necessarily useful and of value in managing the Fund. The management fee paid by
the Fund is not reduced because the Adviser and its affiliates receive these    
services even though the Adviser might otherwise be required to purchase some of
these services for cash.                                                        

As permitted by Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act, the Adviser may cause the Fund to
pay a broker-dealer which provides "brokerage and research services" (as defined
in the 1934 Act) to the Adviser an amount of disclosed commission for effecting 
securities transactions on stock exchanges and other transactions for the Fund  
on an agency basis in excess of the commission which another broker-dealer would
have charged for effecting that transaction. The Adviser's authority to cause   
the Fund to pay any such greater commissions is also subject to such policies as
the Trustees may adopt from time to time. The Adviser does not currently intend 
to cause the Fund to make such payments. It is the position of the staff of the 
SEC that Section 28(e) does not apply to the payment of such greater commissions
in "principal" transactions. Accordingly, the Adviser will use its best effort  
to obtain the most favorable price and execution available with respect to such 
transactions, as described above.                                               

The Predecessor Fund paid brokerage commissions of $18,975, $13,190 and $89,585 
for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and, respectively. In 
fiscal year 2006, the Adviser negotiated a lower commission rate and reduced    
portfolio turnover, resulting in lower brokerage commissions paid in fiscal year
ended August 31, 2006 as compared to prior years.                               

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER

In order to qualify for the beneficial tax treatment afforded regulated         
investment companies, and to be relieved of Federal tax liabilities, the Fund   
must distribute substantially all of its net income to shareholders generally on
an annual basis. Thus, the Fund may have to dispose of portfolio securities     
under disadvantageous circumstances to generate cash or borrow cash in order to 
satisfy the distribution requirement. The Fund does not trade in securities for 
short-term profits but, when circumstances warrant, securities may be sold      
without regard to the length of time they have been held.                       

Average annual portfolio turnover rate is the ratio of the lesser of sales or   
purchases to the monthly average value of the portfolio securities owned during 
the year, excluding from both the numerator and the denominator all securities  
with maturities at the time of acquisition of one year or less. A higher        
portfolio turnover rate involves greater transaction expenses to a fund and may 
result in the realization of net capital gains, which would be taxable to       
shareholders when distributed. The Adviser makes purchases and sales for the    
Fund's portfolio whenever necessary, in the Adviser's opinion, to meet the      
Fund's objective. The Adviser anticipates that the average annual portfolio     
turnover rate of the Fund will be, under normal conditions, between 100% and    
200%. If the Fund does a lot of trading, it may incur additional operating      
expenses, which would reduce performance, and could cause shareowners to incur a
higher level of taxable income or capital gains.                                

TAXATION

The following is a summary discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax        
consequences that may be relevant to a shareholder of the Fund that acquires,   
holds and/or disposes of shares of the Fund, and reflects provisions of the     
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "IRS Code"), existing Treasury   
regulations, rulings published by the IRS, and other applicable authority, as of
the date of this statement of additional information. These authorities are     
subject to change by legislative or administrative action, possibly with        
retroactive effect. The following discussion is only a summary of some of the   
important tax considerations generally applicable to investments in the Fund and
the discussion set forth herein does not constitute tax advice. There may be    
other tax considerations applicable to particular investors. In addition, income
earned through an investment in the Fund may be subject to state, local and     
foreign taxes.                                                                  

The Fund intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" under 
Subchapter M of the "IRS Code". By so qualifying, the Fund will not incur       
federal income taxes on its net investment company taxable income and on net    
realized capital gains (net long-term capital gains in excess of the sum of net 
short-term capital losses and capital losses carryovers from the prior 8 years) 
to the extent distributed in a timely manner to shareholders in the form of     
dividends or capital gain distributions.                                        

To qualify as a regulated investment company, the Fund must, among other things 
(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from (i)       
dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, and gains from  
the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or other income derived with 
respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and
(ii) net income from interests in "qualified publicly traded partnerships" (as  
defined by the IRS Code); (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each
quarter of the taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the Fund's 
assets is represented by cash, U.S. Government securities, the securities of    
other regulated investment companies and other securities, with such other      
securities of any one issuer limited for the purposes of this calculation to an 
amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Fund's total assets and 10% of   
the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of 
the value of its total assets is invested in securities (other than U.S.        
Government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies)
of (I) any one issuer; (II) any two or more issuers that the Fund controls and  
that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related    
trades or businesses or (III) any one or more "qualified publicly traded        
partnerships" (as defined in the IRS Code); and (c) distribute to its           
shareholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (as defined  
in the IRS Code) and 90% of its net exempt interest income each taxable year.   

Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year    
distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax at the    
Fund level. To avoid the tax, the Fund must distribute during each calendar year
an amount equal to the sum of (a) at least 98% of its ordinary income (not      
taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year, (b) at  
least 98% of its capital gains in excess of capital losses (adjusted for certain
ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31st of the  
calendar year, and (c) all ordinary income and capital gains for previous years 
that were not distributed during such years. Under the IRS Code, dividends      
derived from interest, and any short-term capital gains, are taxable to         
shareholders as ordinary income for federal tax purposes, regardless of whether 
such dividends are taken in cash or reinvested in additional shares. Under      
current law, certain income distributions paid by the Fund to individual        
taxpayers are taxed at rates equal to those applicable to net long-term capital 
gains (generally, 15%). This tax treatment applies only if certain holding      
period requirements and other requirements are satisfied by the shareholder and 
the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund
itself. We cannot assure you as to what percentage of the dividends paid on the 
shares will consist of qualified dividend income or long-term capital gains,    
both of which are taxed at lower rates for individuals than are ordinary income 
and short-term capital gains.                                                   

Distributions from the Fund, except in the case of distributions of qualified   
dividend income, as described above, or capital gain dividends, as described    
below, generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividend income to 
the extent of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits.          
Distributions of net capital gains (that is, the excess of net gains from the   
sale of capital assets held more than one year over net losses from the sale of 
capital assets held for not more than one year) properly designated as capital  
gain dividends will be taxable to shareholders as long-term capital gain,       
regardless of how long a shareholder has held the shares in the Fund. Corporate 
investors are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction with respect to 
distributions derived from interest on short-or long-term capital gains from the
Fund but may be entitled to such a deduction in respect to distributions        
attributable to dividends received by the Fund. A distribution will be treated  
as paid on December 31st of a calendar year if it is declared by the Fund in    
October, November or December of the year with a record date in such a month and
paid by the Fund during January of the following year. Such distributions will  
be taxable to shareholders in the calendar year the distributions are declared, 
rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.          

Any redemption or exchange of the Fund's shares is a taxable event and may      
result in a capital gain or loss. A gain or loss, if the shares are capital     
assets in the shareholder's hands, will be long-term or short-term capital gain 
generally depending upon the shareholder's holding period for the shares. Any   
loss realized on a disposition will be disallowed by "wash sale" rules to the   
extent the shares disposed of are replaced within a period of 61 days beginning 
30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition. In such a case, the    
basis of the shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.   
Any loss realized by a shareholder on a disposition of shares held by the       
shareholder for six months or less will be treated as a long-term capital loss  
to the extent of any distributions of capital gain dividends received by the    
shareholder with respect to such shares.                                        

Dividend distributions, capital gains distributions, and capital gains or losses
from redemptions and exchanges may also be subject to state and local taxes.    

Ordinarily, distributions and redemption proceeds paid to Fund shareholders are 
not subject to withholding of federal income tax. However, 28% of the Fund's    
distributions and redemption proceeds must be withheld if a Fund shareholder    
fails to supply the Fund or its agent with such shareholder's taxpayer          
identification number or if the Fund shareholder who is otherwise exempt from   
withholding fails to properly document such shareholder's status as an exempt   
recipient.                                                                      

The foregoing discussion is only a summary of some of the tax considerations    
generally affecting the Fund and its shareholders and does not address the      
special tax rules applicable to certain classes of investors, such as tax-exempt
entities, foreign investors, insurance companies and financial institutions.    
Shareholders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to special tax  
rules that may apply in their particular situations, as well as the state,      
local, and, where applicable, foreign tax consequences of investing in the Fund.

VOTING AND OWNERSHIP OF SHARES

Each share of the Fund has one vote in the election of Trustees. Cumulative     
voting is not authorized for the Fund. This means that the holders of more than 
50% of the shares voting for the election of Trustees can elect 100% of the     
Trustees if they choose to do so, and, in that event, the holders of the        
remaining shares will be unable to elect any Trustees.                          

Shareholders of the Fund and any other future series of the Trust will vote in  
the aggregate and not by series except as otherwise required by law or when the 
Board determines that the matter to be voted upon affects only the interest of  
the shareholders of a particular series. Matters such as ratification of the    
independent public accountants and election of Trustees are not subject to      
separate voting requirements and may be acted upon by shareholders of the Trust 
voting without regard to series.                                                

The authorized capitalization of the Trust consists of 1 billion shares of      
beneficial interest of $0.001 par value per share. Each share has equal         
dividend, distribution and liquidation rights. There are no conversion or       
preemptive rights applicable to any shares of the Fund. All shares issued are   
fully paid and non-assessable.                                                  

RULE18f-3 PLAN - The Board has adopted a Rule 18f-3 Multiple Class Plan on      
behalf of the Trust for the benefit of the Fund. The key features of the Rule   
18f-3 Plan are as follows: (i) shares of each class of the Fund represent an    
equal pro rata interest in the Fund and generally have identical voting,        
dividend, liquidation, and other rights, preferences, powers, restrictions,     
limitations qualifications, terms and conditions, except that each class bears  
certain specific expenses and has separate voting rights on certain matters that
relate solely to that class or in which the interests of shareholders of one    
class differ from the interests of shareholders of another class; and (ii)      
subject to certain limitations described in the prospectuses, shares of a       
particular class of the Fund may be exchanged for shares of the same class of   
another Fund.                                                                   

DISTRIBUTION

In connection with the promotion of the sales of the Fund, the Distributor may, 
from time to time, offer (to all broker dealers who have a sales agreement with 
the Distributor) the opportunity to participate in sales incentive programs     
(which may include non-cash concessions). The Distributor may also, from time to
time, pay expenses and fees required in order to participate in dealer sponsored
seminars and conferences, reimburse dealers for expenses incurred in connection 
with pre-approved seminars, conferences and advertising, and may, from time to  
time, pay or allow additional promotional incentives to dealers as part of      
pre-approved sales contests.                                                    

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

The Fund has adopted a plan pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, whereby  
the Fund or the Adviser may pay the Distributor for certain activities and      
expenses which are primarily intended to result in the sale of the Fund's       
shares, including, but not limited to, advertising, printing of prospectuses and
reports for other than existing shareholders, preparation and distribution of   
advertising materials and sales literature, and payments to dealers and         
shareholder servicing agents who enter into agreements with the Fund or the     
Adviser. The Fund or the Adviser may incur such distribution expenses at the    
rate of 0.25% per annum on the Fund's Class Y shares' average daily net assets. 
For the year ended August 31, 2007 there were $11,494 of 12b-1 and service fees 
incurred by the Fund.                                                           

As of the date of this SAI, Class A, Class B and Class C shares have not        
commenced operations. Accordingly, there were no 12b-1 or service fees incurred 
by the Fund for such shares for the most recently completed fiscal year.        

Payments for distribution expenses under the 12b-1 Plan are subject to Rule     
12b-1 under the 1940 Act. Rule 12b-1 defines distribution expenses to include   
the cost of "any activity which is primarily intended to result in the sale of  
shares issued by the Trust". Rule 12b-1 provides, among other things, that an   
investment company may bear such expenses only pursuant to a plan adopted in    
accordance with the Rule. In accordance with Rule 12b-1, the 12b-1 Plan provides
that a report of the amounts expended under the 12b-1 Plan, and the purposes for
which such expenditures were incurred, will be made to the Board for its review 
at least quarterly. The 12b-1 Plan provides that it may not be amended to       
increase materially the costs which shares of the Fund may bear for distribution
pursuant to the 12b-1 Plan shares without shareholder approval, and that any    
other type of material amendment must be approved by a majority of the Board,   
and by a majority of the trustees who are neither "interested persons" (as      
defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust nor have any direct or indirect financial 
interest in the operation of the 12b-1 Plan or in any related agreement (the    
"12b-1 Trustees"), by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of
considering such amendments.                                                    

Shareholder servicing fees are paid to Service Organizations for providing one  
or more of the following services to such customers: (i) aggregating and        
processing purchase and redemption requests and placing net purchase and        
redemption orders with the Distributor; (ii) processing dividend payments from  
the Fund; (iii) providing sub-accounting or the information necessary for       
sub-accounting; (iv) providing periodic mailings to customers; (v) providing    
customers with information as to their positions in the Fund; (vi) responding to
customer inquiries; and (vii) providing a service to invest the assets of       
customers in Fund shares (as applicable).                                       

The Board has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the 12b-1    
Plans will benefit the Fund. The 12b-1 Plans are subject to annual re-approval  
by a majority of the 12b-1 Trustees and are terminable at any time with respect 
to the Fund by a vote of a majority of the 12b-1 Trustees or by vote of the     
holders of a majority of the applicable classes' outstanding shares of the Fund.
Any agreement entered into pursuant to the 12b-1 Plans with a Service           
Organization is terminable with respect to the Fund without penalty, at any     
time, by vote of a majority of the 12b-1 Trustees, by vote of the holders of a  
majority of the applicable classes' outstanding shares of the Fund, by FDCC or  
by the Service Organization. An agreement will also terminate automatically in  
the event of its assignment.                                                    

As long as the 12b-1 Plans are in effect, the nomination of the trustees who are
not interested persons of the Trust (as defined in the 1940 Act) must be        
committed to the discretion of the 12b-1 Trustees.                              

PURCHASE OF SHARES

You may purchase shares of the Fund directly from FDCC. You may also buy shares 
through accounts with brokers or dealers and other institutions ("authorized    
institutions") that are authorized to place trades in Fund shares for their     
customers. If you invest through an authorized institution, you will have to    
follow its procedures. You will also generally have to address your             
correspondence or questions regarding the Fund to your authorized institution.  
The offering price per share for the Fund's Class Y shares is equal to the NAV  
next determined after the Fund or authorized institution receives your purchase 
order.                                                                          

Authorized institutions may charge their customers a processing or service fee  
in connection with the purchase or redemption of Fund shares. The amount and    
applicability of such a fee is determined and disclosed to its customers by each
individual authorized institution. Processing or service fees typically are     
fixed, nominal dollar amounts and are in addition to the sales and other charges
described in the prospectus and this statement of additional information. Your  
authorized institution will provide you with specific information about any     
processing or service fees you will be charged.                                 

Your authorized institution is responsible for transmitting all subscription and
redemption requests, investment information, documentation and money to the Fund
on time. Certain authorized institutions have agreements with the Fund that     
allow them to enter confirmed purchase or redemption orders on behalf of clients
and customers. Under this arrangement, the authorized institution must send your
order to the Fund by the time they price their shares on the following day. If  
your authorized institution fails to do so, it may be responsible for any       
resulting fees or losses.                                                       

The Fund reserves the right to reject any purchase order and to suspend the     
offering of shares of the Fund. Under certain circumstances the Trust or the    
Adviser may waive the minimum initial investment for purchases by officers,     
directors, and employees of the Trust and its affiliated entities and for       
certain related advisory accounts and retirement accounts (such as IRAs). The   
Fund may also change or waive policies concerning minimum investment amounts at 
any time.                                                                       

REDEMPTION OF SHARES

Redemption of shares, or payment for redemptions, may be suspended at times (a) 
when the NYSE is closed for other than customary weekend or holiday closings,   
(b) when trading on said exchange is restricted, (c) when an emergency exists,  
as a result of which disposal by the Fund of securities owned by it is not      
reasonably practicable, or it is not reasonably practicable for the Fund fairly 
to determine the value of its net assets, or (d) during any other period when   
the SEC, by order, so permits, provided that applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC shall govern as to whether the conditions prescribed in (b) or (c)      
exist.                                                                          

Shareholders who purchased shares through a broker-dealer may also redeem such  
shares by written request to the Transfer Agent which shares are held by the    
Transfer Agent at the address set forth in the prospectus. To be considered in  
"good order", written requests for redemption should indicate the dollar amount 
or number of shares to be redeemed, refer to the shareholder's Fund account     
number, including either the social security or tax identification number. The  
request should be signed in exactly the same way the account is registered. If  
there is more than one owner of the shares, all owners must sign. If shares to  
be redeemed have a value of $5,000 or more or redemption proceeds are to be paid
by someone other than the shareholder at the shareholder's address of record,   
the signature(s) must be guaranteed by an "eligible guarantor institution,"     
which includes a commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Deposit        
Insurance Corporation, a trust company, a member firm of a domestic stock       
exchange, a savings association or a credit union that is authorized by its     
charter to provide a signature guarantee. The Transfer Agent may reject         
redemption instructions if the guarantor is neither a member of nor a           
participant in a signature guarantee program. Signature guarantees by notaries  
public are not acceptable. The purpose of a signature guarantee is to protect   
shareholders against the possibility of fraud. Further documentation will be    
requested from corporations, administrators, executors, personal                
representatives, trustees and custodians. Redemption requests given by facsimile
will not be accepted. Unless other instructions are given in proper form, a     
check for the proceeds of the redemption will be sent to the shareholder's      
address of record. Share purchases and redemptions are governed by Delaware     
state law.                                                                      

You may sell your shares by giving instructions to the Transfer Agent by mail or
by telephone. The Fund will use reasonable procedures to confirm that           
instructions communicated by telephone are genuine and, if the procedures are   
followed, will not be liable for any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent   
telephone transactions. The Fund's procedure is to redeem shares at the NAV     
determined after the Fund or authorized institution receives the redemption     
request in proper order, less any applicable deferred sales charge. Payment will
be made promptly, but no later than the seventh day following receipt of the    
redemption request in proper order.                                             

SPECIAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES

As described briefly in the prospectuses, the Fund offers the following         
shareholder services:                                                           

Regular Account - The regular account allows for voluntary investments to be    
made at any time. Available to individuals, custodians, corporations, trusts,   
estates, corporate retirement plans and others, investors are free to make      
additions and withdrawals to or from their account as often as they wish. Simply
use the account application provided with the prospectuses to open your account.

Telephone Transactions - A shareholder may redeem shares or transfer into       
another fund by telephone if this service is requested at the time the          
shareholder completes the initial account application. If it is not elected at  
that time, it may be elected at a later date by making a request in writing to  
the Transfer Agent and having the signature on the request guaranteed. The Fund 
employs reasonable procedures designed to confirm the authenticity of           
instructions communicated by telephone and, if it does not, it may be liable for
any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent transactions. As a result of this  
policy, a shareholder authorizing telephone redemption or transfer bears the    
risk of loss which may result from unauthorized or fraudulent transactions which
the Fund believes to be genuine. When requesting a telephone redemption or      
transfer, the shareholder will be asked to respond to certain questions designed
to confirm the shareholder's identity as the shareholder of record. Cooperation 
with these procedures helps to protect the account and the Fund from            
unauthorized transactions.                                                      

Automatic Investment Plans - Any shareholder may utilize this feature, which    
provides for automatic monthly investments into your account. Upon your request,
the Transfer Agent will withdraw a fixed amount each month from a checking or   
savings account for investment into the Fund. This does not require a commitment
for a fixed period of time. A shareholder may change the monthly investment,    
skip a month or discontinue the Automatic Investment Plan as desired by         
notifying the Transfer Agent at (800) 628-4077.                                 

Individual Retirement Account ("IRA") - All wage earners under 70-1/2, even     
those who participate in a company sponsored or government retirement plan, may 
establish their own IRA. You can contribute 100% of your earnings up to $4,000. 
Individuals who are, or become, at least 50 years old during the taxable year   
may contribute an additional $500 per year. A spouse who does not earn          
compensation can contribute up to $3,000 per year to his or her own IRA. The    
deductibility of such contributions will be determined under the same rules as  
for contributions made by individuals with earned income. A special IRA program 
is available for corporate employees under which the employers may establish IRA
accounts for their employees in lieu of establishing corporate retirement plans.
Known as SEP-IRA's (Simplified Employee Pension-IRA), they free the corporate   
employer of many of the recordkeeping requirements or establishing and          
maintaining a corporate retirement plan trust.                                  

If a shareholder has received a distribution from another qualified retirement  
plan, all or part of that distribution may be rolled over into your Fund IRA. A 
rollover contribution is not subject to the limits on annual IRA contributions. 
By acting within applicable time limits of the distribution you can continue to 
defer federal income taxes on your rollover contribution and on any income that 
is earned on that contribution.                                                 

Roth IRA - A Roth IRA permits certain taxpayers to make a non-deductible        
investment of up to $4,000 per year. Individuals who are, or become, at least 50
years old during the taxable year may contribute an additional $500 per year.   
Provided an investor does not withdraw money from his or her Roth IRA for a 5   
year period, beginning with the first tax year for which contribution was made, 
deductions from the investor's Roth IRA would be tax free after the investor    
reaches the age of 59-1/2. Tax free withdrawals may also be made before reaching
the age of 59-1/2 under certain circumstances. Please consult your financial    
and/or tax professional as to your eligibility to invest in a Roth IRA. An      
investor may not make a contribution to both a Roth IRA and a regular IRA in any
given year. An annual limit of $4,000 applies to contributions to regular and   
Roth IRAs. For example, if a taxpayer contributes $4,000 to a regular IRA for a 
year, he or she may not make any contribution to a Roth IRA for that year.      

How to Establish Retirements Accounts - Please call the Trust to obtain         
information regarding the establishment of individual retirement plan accounts. 
The plan's custodian charges nominal fees in connection with plan establishment 
and maintenance. These fees are detailed in the plan documents. A shareholder   
may wish to consult with an attorney or other tax adviser for specific advice   
concerning tax status and plans.                                                

 DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Net investment income, if any, is declared as dividends and paid annually.      
Substantially all the realized net capital gains for the Fund, if any, are also 
declared and paid on an annual basis. Dividends and distributions are payable to
shareholders of record at the time of declaration.                              

Distributions from the Fund are automatically reinvested in additional Fund     
shares unless the shareholder has elected to have them paid in cash.            

 NET ASSET VALUE

The price per share of the Fund is referred to as the Fund's "net asset value." 
The method for determining the Fund's net asset value is summarized in the      
prospectus in the text following the heading "When And How NAV Is Determined".  
The net asset value of the Fund's shares is determined on each day on which the 
NYSE is open, provided that the net asset value need not be determined on days  
when no Fund shares are tendered for redemption and no order for Fund shares is 
received. The NYSE is not open for business on the following holidays (or on the
nearest Monday or Friday if the holiday falls on a weekend): New Year's Day,    
President's Day, Good Friday, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Memorial Day,    
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.                        

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE

For purposes of quoting and comparing the performance of the Fund to that of    
other mutual funds and to relevant indices in advertisements or in reports to   
shareholders, performance will be stated in terms of total return or yield. Both
"total return" and "yield" figures are based on the historical performance of a 
fund, show the performance of a hypothetical investment and are not intended to 
indicate future performance.                                                    

YIELD INFORMATION - From time to time, the Fund may advertise a yield figure. A 
portfolio's yield is a way of showing the rate of income the portfolio earns on 
its investments as a percentage of the portfolio's share price. Under the rules 
of the SEC, yield must be calculated according to the following formula:        

6                                 
Yield = 2[(a-b +1)-1]                                               
---                                           
cd                                            

where:                                                                          

a     =    dividends and interest earned during the period.                     
b     =    expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements).             
c     =    the   average   daily   number  of  shares   outstanding             
       during the period that were  entitled    to    receive dividends.
d     =    the  maximum  offering  price  per share on the last day             
of the period.                                            

The Fund's yield, as used in advertising, is computed by dividing the Fund's    
interest and dividend income for a given 30-day period, net of expenses, by the 
average number of shares entitled to receive distributions during the period    
dividing this figure by the Fund's NAV at the end of the period and annualizing 
the result (assuming compounding of income) in order to arrive at an annual     
percentage rate. Income is calculated for purposes of yield quotations in       
accordance with standardized methods applicable to all stock and bond mutual    
funds. Dividends from equity investments are treated as if they were accrued on 
a daily basis solely for the purposes of yield calculations. In general,        
interest income is reduced with respect to bonds trading at a premium over their
par value by subtracting a portion of the premium from income on a daily basis, 
and is increased with respect to bonds trading at a discount by adding a portion
of the discount to daily income. Capital gains and losses generally are excluded
from the calculation. Income calculated for the purpose of calculating the      
Fund's yield differs from income as determined for other accounting purposes.   
Because of the different accounting methods used, and because of the compounding
assumed in yield calculations, the yield quoted for the Fund may differ from the
rate of distributions the Fund paid over the same period or the rate of income  
reported in the Fund's financial statements.                                    

TOTAL RETURN PERFORMANCE - Under the rules of the SEC, fund advertising         
performance must include total return quotes, "T" below, calculated according to
the following formula:                                                          

n                                                         
P(1+T) = ERV                                                        

where:                                                                          

P     =    hypothetical initial payment of $1,000                               
T     =    average annual total return                                          
n     =    number of years (1,5 or 10)                                          
ERV   =    ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 payment made at the 
     beginning of the 1, 5 or 10 year periods (or fractional portion
thereof).                                                 

The average annual total return (before taxes) will be calculated under the     
foregoing formula and the time periods used in advertising will be based on     
rolling calendar quarters, updated to the last day of the most recent quarter   
prior to submission of the advertising for publication, and will cover          
prescribed periods. When the period since inception is less than one year, the  
total return quoted will be the aggregate return for the period. In calculating 
the ending redeemable value, all dividends and distributions by the Fund are    
assumed to have been reinvested at NAV as described in the prospectus on the    
reinvestment dates during the period. Total return, or "T" in the formula above,
is computed by finding the average annual compounded rates of return over the   
prescribed periods (or fractional portions thereof) that would equate the       
initial amount invested to the ending redeemable value.                         

Total return, or "T" in the formula above, is computed by finding the average   
annual compounded rates of return over the prescribed periods (or fractional    
portions thereof) that would equate the initial amount invested to the ending   
redeemable value.                                                               

Based on the foregoing, the Fund's average annual total returns (before taxes)  
for the period or years indicated would be:

(1) Class Y shares' commencement of operations was March 1, 2000.               

The "average annual total returns (after taxes on distributions)" and "average  
annual total returns (after taxes on distributions and redemptions)" for the    
Fund's Class Y shares are included in the prospectus.                           

"Average annual total return (after taxes on distributions)" for a specified    
period is derived by calculating the actual dollar amount of the investment     
return on a $1,000 investment made at the maximum public offering price         
applicable at the beginning of the period, and then calculating the annual      
compounded rate of return (after federal income taxes on distributions but not  
redemptions) which would produce that amount, assuming a redemption at the end  
of the period. This calculation assumes a complete redemption of the investment 
but further assumes that the redemption has no federal income tax consequences. 
This calculation also assumes that all dividends and distributions, less the    
federal income taxes due on such distributions, are reinvested at net asset     
value on the reinvestment dates during the period. In calculating the impact of 
federal income taxes due on distributions, the federal income tax rates used    
correspond to the tax character of each component of the distributions (e.g.,   
ordinary income rate for ordinary income distributions, short-term capital gain 
rate for short-term capital gains distributions and long-term capital gain rate 
for long-term capital gains distributions). The highest individual marginal     
federal income tax rate in effect on the reinvestment date is applied to each   
component of the distributions on the reinvestment date. Note that these tax    
rates may vary over the measurement period. The effect of applicable tax        
credits, such as the foreign tax credit, is also taken into account in          
accordance with federal tax laws. The calculation disregards (i) the affect of  
phase-outs of certain exemptions, deductions and credits at various income      
levels, (ii) the impact of the federal alternative minimum tax and (iii) the    
potential tax liabilities other than federal tax liabilities (e.g., state and   
local taxes).                                                                   

"Average annual total return (after taxes on distributions and redemptions)" for
a specified period is derived by calculating the actual dollar amount of the    
investment return on a $1,000 investment made at the maximum public offering    
price applicable at the beginning of the period, and then calculating the annual
compounded rate of return (after federal income taxes on distributions and      
redemptions) which would produce that amount, assuming a redemption at the end  
of the period. This calculation also assumes that all dividends and             
distributions, less the federal income taxes due on such distributions, are     
reinvested at net asset value on the reinvestment dates during the period. In   
calculating the federal income taxes due on distributions, the federal income   
tax rates used correspond to the tax character of each component of the         
distributions (e.g., ordinary income rate for ordinary income distributions,    
short-term capital gain rate for short-term capital gains distributions and     
long-term capital gain rate for long-term capital gains distributions). The     
highest individual marginal federal income tax rate in effect on the            
reinvestment date is applied to each component of the distributions on the      
reinvestment date. Note that these tax rates may vary over the measurement      
period. The effect of applicable tax credits, such as the foreign tax credit, is
taken into account in accordance with federal tax law. The calculation          
disregards the (i) effect of phase-outs of certain exemptions, deductions and   
credits at various income levels, (ii) the impact of the federal alternative    
minimum tax and (iii) the potential tax liabilities other than federal tax      
liabilities (e.g., state and local taxes). In calculating the federal income    
taxes due on redemptions, capital gains taxes resulting from a redemption are   
subtracted from the redemption proceeds and the tax benefits from capital losses
resulting from the redemption are added to the redemption proceeds. The highest 
federal individual capital gains tax rate in effect on the redemption date is   
used in such calculation. The federal income tax rates used correspond to the   
tax character of any gains or losses (e.g., short-term or long-term).           

PERFORMANCE REPORTING - The Fund's performance may be compared with the         
performance of other funds with comparable investment objectives, tracked by    
fund rating services or with other indexes of market performance. Sources of    
economic data that may be considered in making such comparisons may include, but
are not limited to, rankings of any mutual fund or mutual fund category tracked 
by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. or Morningstar, Inc.; data provided by the  
Investment Company Institute; major indexes of stock market performance; and    
indexes and historical data supplied by major securities brokerage or investment
advisory firms. The Fund may also utilize reprints from newspapers and magazines
furnished by third parties to illustrate historical performance.                

The agencies listed below measure performance based on their own criteria rather
than on the standardized performance measures described in the preceding        
section.                                                                        

Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. distributes mutual fund rankings monthly. The  
rankings are based on total return performance calculated by Lipper, generally  
reflecting changes in net asset value adjusted for reinvestment of capital gains
and income dividends. They do not reflect deduction of any sales charges. Lipper
rankings cover a variety of performance periods, including year-to-date, 1-year,
5-year, and 10-year performance. Lipper classifies mutual funds by investment   
objective and asset category.                                                   

Morningstar, Inc. distributes mutual fund ratings twice a month. The ratings are
divided into five groups: highest, above average, neutral, below average and    
lowest. They represent the fund's historical risk/reward ratio relative to other
funds in its broad investment class as determined by Morningstar, Inc.          
Morningstar ratings cover a variety of performance periods, including 1-year,   
3-year, 5-year, 10-year and overall performance. The performance factor for the 
overall rating is a weighted-average assessment of the fund's 1-year, 3-year,   
5-year, and 10- year total return performance (if available) reflecting         
deduction of expenses and sales charges. Performance is adjusted using          
quantitative techniques to reflect the risk profile of the fund. The ratings are
derived from a purely quantitative system that does not utilize the subjective  
criteria customarily employed by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's and  
Moody's Investor Service, Inc.                                                  

CDA/Weisenberger's Management Results publishes mutual fund rankings and is     
distributed monthly. The rankings are based entirely on total return calculated 
by Weisenberger for periods such as year-to-date, 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and    
10-year. Mutual funds are ranked in general categories (e.g., international     
bond, international equity, municipal bond, and maximum capital gain).          
Weisenberger rankings do not reflect deduction of sales charges or fees.        

Independent publications may also evaluate the Fund's performance. The Fund may,
from time to time, refer to results published in various periodicals, including 
Barrons, Financial World, Forbes, Fortune, Investor's Business Daily,           
Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, Money, U.S. News and World Report and The
Wall Street Journal.

SATUIT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC

Proxy and Corporate Action Voting
 Policies and Procedures
I. POLICY.                                                                      

Satuit Capital Management, LLC (the "Adviser") acts as a discretionary          
investment adviser for various clients, including clients governed by the       
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and registered        
open-end management investment companies (i.e., "mutual funds"). The Adviser is 
registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") as an   
investment adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended  
(the "Advisers Act"). Some of the Adviser's clients have delegated to the       
Adviser the authority to vote proxies or act with respect to corporate actions  
that may arise with respect to securities held within such client's investment  
portfolio. Corporate actions may include, for example and without limitation,   
tender offers or exchanges, bankruptcy proceedings, and class actions. The      
Adviser's authority to vote proxies or act with respect to other corporate      
actions is established through the delegation of discretionary authority under  
its Advisory Agreements. Therefore, unless a client (including a "named         
fiduciary" under ERISA) specifically reserves the right, in writing, to vote its
own proxies or to take shareholder action with respect to other corporate       
actions requiring shareholder actions, the Adviser will vote all proxies and act
on all other actions in a timely manner as part of its full discretionary       
authority over client assets in accordance with these policies and procedures.  

When voting proxies or acting with respect to corporate actions on behalf of    
clients, the Adviser's utmost concern is that all decisions be made solely in   
the best interests of the client (and for ERISA accounts, plan beneficiaries and
participants, in accordance with the letter and spirit of ERISA). The Adviser   
will act in a prudent and diligent manner intended to enhance the economic value
of the assets in the client's account.                                          

II. PURPOSE.                                                                    

The purpose of these policies and procedures is to memorialize the procedures   
and policies adopted by the Adviser to enable it to comply with its fiduciary   
responsibilities to clients and the requirements of Rule 206(4)-6 under the     
Advisers Act. These policies and procedures also reflect the fiduciary standards
and responsibilities set forth by the Department of Labor for ERISA accounts.   

III. PROCEDURES.                                                                

The Adviser is ultimately responsible for ensuring that all proxies received are
voted in a timely manner and in a manner consistent with the Adviser's          
determination of the client's best interests. Although many proxy proposals may 
be voted in accordance with the Guidelines described in Section V below, some   
proposals require special consideration which may dictate that the Adviser makes
an exception to the Guidelines.                                                 

The Adviser is also responsible for ensuring that all corporate action notices  
or requests which require shareholder action that are received are addressed in 
a timely manner and consistent action is taken across all similarly situated    
client accounts. A. Conflicts of Interest.                                      

Where a proxy proposal raises a material conflict between the Adviser's         
interests and a client's interest, including a mutual fund client, the Adviser  
will resolve such a conflict in the manner described below:                     

1. Vote in Accordance with the Guidelines. To the extent that the Adviser has   
little or no discretion to deviate from the Guidelines with respect to the      
proposal in question, the Adviser shall vote in accordance with such            
pre-determined voting policy.                                                   

2. Obtain Consent of Clients. To the extent that the Adviser has discretion to  
deviate from the Guidelines with respect to the proposal in question, the       
Adviser will disclose the conflict to the relevant clients and obtain their     
consent to the proposed vote prior to voting the securities. The disclosure to  
the client will include sufficient detail regarding the matter to be voted on   
and the nature of the conflict so that the client will be able to make an       
informed decision regarding the vote. If a client does not respond to such a    
conflict disclosure request or denies the request, the Adviser will abstain from
voting the securities held by that client's account.                            

3. Client Directive to Use an Independent Third Party. Alternatively, a client  
may, in writing, specifically direct the Adviser to forward all proxy matters in
which the Adviser has a conflict of interest regarding the client's securities  
to an identified independent third party for review and recommendation. Where   
such independent third party's recommendations are received on a timely basis,  
the Adviser will vote all such proxies in accordance with such third party's    
recommendation. If the third party's recommendations are not timely received,   
the Adviser will abstain from voting the securities held by that client's       
account.                                                                        

The Adviser will review the proxy proposal for conflicts of interest as part of 
the overall vote review process. All material conflicts of interest so          
identified will be addressed as described above in this Section III, A.         

B. Limitations.                                                                 

In certain circumstances, in accordance with a client's investment advisory     
agreement (or other written directive) or where the Adviser has determined that 
it is in the client's best interest, the Adviser will not vote proxies received.
The following are certain circumstances where the Adviser will limit its role in
voting proxies:                                                                 

1. Client Maintains Proxy Voting Authority. Where a client specifies in writing 
that it will maintain the authority to vote proxies itself or that it has       
delegated the right to vote proxies to a third party, the Adviser will not vote 
the securities and will direct the relevant custodian to send the proxy material
directly to the client. If any proxy material is received by the Adviser for    
such account, it will promptly be forwarded to the client or specified third    
party.                                                                          

2. Terminated Account. Once a client account has been terminated in accordance  
with its investment advisory agreement, the Adviser will not vote any proxies   
received after the termination date. However, the client may specify in writing 
that proxies should be directed to the client (or a specified third party) for  
action.                                                                         

3. Limited Value. If the Adviser determines that the value of a client's        
economic interest or the value of the portfolio holding is indeterminable or    
insignificant, the Adviser may abstain from voting a client's proxies. The      
Adviser also will not vote proxies received for securities which are no longer  
held by the client's account. In addition, the Adviser generally will not vote  
securities where the economic value of the securities in the client account is  
less than $500.                                                                 

4. Securities Lending Programs. When securities are out on loan, they are       
transferred into the borrower's name and are voted by the borrower, in its      
discretion. However, where the Adviser determines that a proxy vote (or other   
shareholder action) is materially important to the client's account, the Adviser
may recall the security for the purposes of voting.                             

5. Unjustifiable Costs. In certain circumstances, after doing a cost-benefit    
analysis, the Adviser may abstain from voting where the cost of voting a        
client's proxy would exceed any anticipated benefits from the proxy proposal.   

IV. RECORD KEEPING.                                                             

In accordance with Rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act, the Adviser will maintain 
for the time periods set forth in the Rule: (i) these proxy voting procedures   
and policies, and all amendments thereto; (ii) all proxy statements received    
regarding client securities (provided however, that the Adviser may rely on the 
proxy statement filed on EDGAR as its records); (iii) a record of all votes cast
on behalf of clients; (iv) records of all written client requests for proxy     
voting information; (v) a copy of any written response made by the Adviser to   
any written or oral client request for proxy voting information; (vi) any       
documents prepared by the Adviser that were material to making a decision on how
to vote or that memorialized the basis for the decision; and (vii) all records  
relating to requests made to clients regarding conflicts of interest in voting  
the proxy.                                                                      

The Adviser will describe in its Form ADV, Part II (or other brochure fulfilling
the requirement of Rule 204-3 under the Advisers Act) its proxy voting policies 
and procedures and will inform clients how they may obtain information on how   
the Adviser voted proxies with respect to the clients' portfolio securities. The
Adviser will also provide to each mutual fund client a copy of its policies and 
procedures. Clients may obtain information on how their securities were voted or
a copy of the policies and procedures by written request addressed to the       
Adviser.                                                                        

The Adviser will coordinate with all mutual fund clients to assist in the       
provision of all information required to be filed by such mutual funds on Form  
N-PX. Form N-PX will provide information concerning each matter relating to a   
portfolio security considered at any shareholder meeting with respect to which a
mutual fund was entitled to vote. Each Form N-PX will need to be filed no later 
than August 31st of each year, and will cover all proxy votes with respect to   
which a mutual fund was entitled to vote for the period July 1st through June   
30th. The Adviser shall maintain and provide the following information          
concerning any shareholder meetings with respect to which a mutual fund they    
manage was entitled to vote:                                                    

o     the name of the issuer of the portfolio security;                         
o     the exchange ticker symbol of the portfolio security(1);                  
o     the CUSIP number of the portfolio security(1);                            
o     the shareholder meeting date;                                             
o     a brief description of the matter voted on;                               
o     whether   the  matter  was  put  forward  by  the  issuer  or             
a shareholder;                                                      
o     whether the mutual fund voted;                                            
o     how the mutual fund cast its vote; and                                    
o     whether    the   mutual   fund   cast   its   vote   for   or             
against management.                                                 

V. GUIDELINES.                                                                  

Each proxy issue will be considered individually. The following guidelines are a
partial list to be used in voting proposals contained in the proxy statements,  
but will not be used as rigid rules.                                            

A. Oppose.                                                                      

The Adviser will generally vote against any management proposal that clearly has
the effect of restricting the ability of shareholders to realize the full       
potential value of their investment. Proposals in this category would include:  

1. Issues regarding the issuer's board entrenchment and anti-takeover measures  
such as the following: a. Proposals to stagger board members' terms; b.         
Proposals to limit the ability of shareholders to call special meetings; c.     
Proposals to require super majority votes; d. Proposals requesting excessive    
increases in authorized common or preferred shares where management provides no 
explanation for the use or need of these additional shares; e. Proposals        
regarding "fair price" provisions; f. Proposals regarding "poison pill"         
provisions; and g. Permitting "green mail".                                     

2. Providing cumulative voting rights.                                          

B. Approve.                                                                     

Routine proposals are those which do not change the structure, bylaws, or       
operations of the corporation to the detriment of the shareholders. Given the   
routine nature of these proposals, proxies will nearly always be voted with     
management. Traditionally, these issues include:                                

1. Election of independent accountants recommended by management, unless seeking
to replace if there exists a dispute over policies.                             

2. Date and place of annual meeting.                                            

3. Limitation on charitable contributions or fees paid to lawyers.              

4. Ratification of directors' actions on routine matters since previous annual  
meeting.                                                                        

5. Confidential voting. Confidential voting is most often proposed by           
shareholders as a means of eliminating undue management pressure on shareholders
regarding their vote on proxy issues. The Adviser will generally vote to approve
these proposals as shareholders can later divulge their votes to management on a
selective basis if a legitimate reason arises.                                  

6. Limiting directors' liability.                                               

7. Eliminate preemptive rights. Preemptive rights give current shareholders the 
opportunity to maintain their current percentage ownership through any          
subsequent equity offerings. These provisions are no longer common in the U.S., 
and can restrict management's ability to raise new capital.                     

8. The Adviser will generally vote to approve the elimination of preemptive     
rights, but will oppose the elimination of listed preemptive rights, e.g., on   
proposed issues representing more than an acceptable level of total dilution.   

9. Employee Stock Purchase Plans.                                               

10. Establish 40 1(k) Plans.                                                    

C. Case-By-Case.                                                                

The Adviser will review each issue in this category on a case-by-case basis.    
Voting decisions will he made based on the financial interest of the client     
involved. These matters include proposals to:                                   

1. Pay directors solely in stock;                                               

2. Eliminate director's mandatory retirement policy;                            

3. Rotate annual meeting location or date;                                      

4. Changes in the state of incorporation;                                       

5. Social and corporate responsibility issues;                                  

6. Option and stock grants to management and directors; and                     

7. Allowing indemnification of directors and/or officers after reviewing the    
applicable laws and extent of protection requested.                             

D. Investment Company Issues.                                                   

From time to time the Adviser will have to vote shares of investment company    
securities that may be held in a client's account. These matters generally      
include proposals to:

(1)

You 
      will be subject to a 2.00% redemption fee if you redeem your shares less 
      than 360 calendar days after you purchase them. If this fee is imposed it 
      would raise the expenses of your shares. Such fees, when imposed, are 
      credited directly to the assets of the Fund to help defray the expenses to 
      the Fund of short-term trading activities. These fees are never used to 
      pay distribution or sales fees or expenses. The redemption fee will not be 
      assessed on certain types of accounts or under certain 
      conditions.  If you purchased Class C shares of the Fund before 
      July 25, 2008, and you redeem those shares less than two years from the 
      date of purchase (regardless of such Class C shares having been converted 
      to No-Load shares), you will be subject to a 2.00% deferred sales charge, 
      and not the 2.00% redemption fee.





  
      

(2)

A 
      shareholder may be charged a $10 fee for each telephone 
      exchange.





  
      

(3)

The 
      Board has approved a Plan of Distribution pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 
      Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), providing for 
      the payment of distribution and service fees to the distributor of the 
      Fund. See "Distribution Arrangements - Rule 12b-1 Fees." The 12b-1 fees 
      may cause long-term investors to pay more than the economic equivalent of 
      the maximum front-end sales charge permitted by the Financial Industry 
      Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").





  
      

(4)

"Other 
      Operating Expenses" include, among other expenses, administrative, 
      custody, transfer agency and shareholder servicing fees. However, "Other 
      Operating Expenses" do not include portfolio trading commissions and 
      related expenses as determined under generally accepted accounting 
      principles.





  
      

(5)

In the interest of limiting 
      expenses of the Fund, the Adviser has entered into a contractual expense 
      limitation agreement with the Trust.  Pursuant to the expense 
      limitation agreement, the Adviser has agreed to waive or limit its fees 
      and assume other expenses of the Fund (excluding interest, taxes, 
      brokerage commissions and other expenditures capitalized in accordance 
      with generally accepted accounting principles or other extraordinary 
      expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of business) so that the 
      Fund’s ratio of total annual operating expenses is limited to 1.95% until 
      October 31, 2010.  The Adviser is entitled to the reimbursement 
      of fees waived or reimbursed by the Adviser to the Fund subject to the 
      limitations that (1) the reimbursement is made only for fees and expenses 
      incurred not more than three years prior to the date of reimbursement, and 
      (2) the reimbursement may not be made if it would cause the Fund’s annual 
      expense limitation to be 
exceeded.
 
Example:
The 
following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the 
Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.  The Example 
assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and 
then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods.  The 
Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and annual 
Fund operating expenses remain the same.  Lastly, the Example assumes 
that any expense caps or limitations remain in place throughout the time periods 
indicated.  Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based 
on these assumptions your costs would be:

PORTFOLIO 
TURNOVER
The fund 
pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities 
(or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate 
higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are 
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund 
operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the 
Fund's most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was ____% 
of the average value of its portfolio.

PRINCIPAL 
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
The Fund 
seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its 
assets in a diversified portfolio of U.S. common stocks of micro cap companies. 
The Adviser considers a company to be a micro cap company when its market 
capitalization, at the time of purchase, is $500 million or less. The Adviser 
will select portfolio securities which the Adviser believes exhibit reasonable 
valuations and favorable growth prospects.

The 
Adviser utilizes proprietary quantitative analysis of both value and growth 
characteristics to rank U.S. micro cap companies. Valuation and growth 
characteristics are equally weighted for purposes of ranking potential 
investment securities. Valuation analysis is used to determine the inherent 
value of the company and requires the analysis of financial information such as 
a company's price to book, price to sales, return on equity, and return on 
assets ratios. Growth analysis is used to determine a company's potential for 
long-term dividends and earnings growth as determined by market-oriented factors 
such as market share, the launch of new products or services, the strength of 
its management and market demand. From these analyses, the Adviser ranks the 
companies that exhibit stable and growing valuation ratios and the most 
favorable dividends and earnings prospects and lists them on what it refers to 
as the Focus List. The Adviser selects portfolio securities for investment by 
the Fund by subjecting the common stocks on the Focus List to a qualitative 
analysis of each company's valuation and growth characteristics in order to 
determine whether these characteristics are sustainable over the long term. Such 
analysis includes a more detailed review of each company's competitive position 
in its particular market sector, its business prospects and financial 
statements. The Adviser also regularly conducts interviews with company 
management and Wall Street analysts who provide research about a company's 
common stock in the stock market.

Portfolio 
securities may be sold as a result of adverse changes in the stock markets 
generally, or to a specific issuer, that results in poor relative performance. 
Portfolio securities may also be sold if the Adviser determines that the 
valuation and growth characteristics that formed the basis for purchasing a 
stock no longer meet the criteria for portfolio securities of the 
Fund.

Temporary Defensive 
Strategy 
― At times, the Fund may employ temporary defensive strategies in 
response to unfavorable economic, market, political or other conditions. At such 
times, the Fund may increase its cash reserves without limit by holding high 
quality, short-term debt securities and money market instruments and by entering 
into repurchase agreements. These investments are inconsistent with the Fund's 
primary investment strategies. As a result, during these periods, the Fund may 
not achieve its objective.

PRINCIPAL 
RISKS
Investing 
in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose money. The 
principal risks of investing in the Fund are listed below and could adversely 
affect the net asset value (the "NAV"), total return and value of the Fund and 
your investment.

Stock Market 
Risks: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks and 
significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in value, the 
Fund is likely to decline in value and you could lose money on your 
investment.

Stock Selection 
Risks:  The portfolio securities selected by the Adviser may 
decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is 
rising and may fail to meet the Fund's investment objective.

Risks of 
Investment In Micro Cap Companies:  The Fund invests 
principally in micro cap    companies (generally a market 
capitalization of $500 million or less).  Accordingly, the Fund may be 
subject to the additional risks associated with investment in companies with 
micro capital structures.   These companies may (i) have 
relatively small revenues, (ii) have limited product lines or services, 
(iii)  lack depth of management, (iv) lack the ability to obtain funds 
necessary for growth, and (v) feature  products or services for which 
a market does not yet exist and/or may never be established.  The 
increased risk involved with investing in micro cap companies may cause the 
market prices of their securities to be more volatile than those of larger, more 
established companies.  Further, these securities tend to trade at a 
lower volume than do those of larger, more established companies.  If 
the Fund is heavily invested in these securities, the NAV of the Fund will be 
more susceptible to sudden and significant losses if the value of these 
securities decline.
 











You could 
lose money on your investment in the Fund, or the Fund may not perform as well 
as other possible investments. The Fund does not constitute a balanced or 
complete investment program and the NAV of its shares will fluctuate based on 
the value of the securities held by the Fund.

PAST 
PERFORMANCE
The 
following bar chart and table provide some indication of the potential risks of 
investing in the Fund. The Fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) is 
not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the 
future.  More up-to-date returns are available on the Funds’ website 
at www.satuitcapital.com 
or by calling the Fund, toll free, at 1-866-972-8848.
 

The bar 
chart below shows the variability of the fund’s performance from year to year. 
The bar chart and highest/lowest quarterly returns that follow include expense 
waivers and/or reimbursements, and if these charges were reflected, the returns

Effective 
      July 25, 2008, the front-end sales charge of the Fund’s Class A shares, 
      which commenced operations on December 12, 2000, was removed, making this 
      class No-Load.  In addition, on July 25, 2008, the Fund’s Class 
      C shares, which commenced operations on April 21, 2004, were converted to 
      No-Load shares.

After-tax 
      returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal 
      marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and 
      local taxes.  Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's 
      tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown 
      are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through 
      tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement 
      accounts.

The 
      Russell 2000 Index (the "Russell Index") is a market capitalization index 
      that measures the performance of 2000 small-cap stocks in various 
      industries. The Russell Index is not adjusted to reflect deductions for 
      fees, expenses or taxes that the SEC requires to be reflected in the 
      Fund's performance.
 










 





(4)

The 
      Russell Micro Cap Index measures the performance of the micro cap segment 
      of the U.S. equity market, which comprises less than three percent of the 
      U.S. equity market. It includes 2,000 of the smallest securities in the 
      Russell 2000 Index based on a combination of their market cap and current 
      index membership.

is most appropriate for investors who understand the risks of investing in 
domestic smaller capitalization stock markets and who are willing to accept

SECTION 
2-  WHO MANAGES YOUR MONEY

THE 
INVESTMENT ADVISER
Satuit 
Capital  Management,  LLC, 3547 Meeks Farm Road, Suite A2, 
St. Johns Island, SC 29455, manages the investments  of the Fund 
pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory 
Agreement").  As of February 28th, 2009, the Adviser had approximately 
$___ 
million in assets under management.  Robert J. Sullivan, Chairman of 
the Trust, is the majority owner of the Adviser. Under the Advisory Agreement, 
the Adviser, subject to the general supervision of the Board, manages the Fund 
in accordance with its investment objective and policies, makes decisions with 
respect to, and places orders for, all purchases and sales of portfolio 
securities, and maintains related records.

Under the 
Advisory Agreement, the monthly compensation paid to the Adviser is accrued 
daily at an annual rate of 1.25% on the average daily net assets of the Fund. 
For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009, the Adviser earned fees at the 
annual rate of 1.25% on the Fund's average daily net assets.

In the 
interest of limiting expenses of the Fund, the Adviser has entered into a 
contractual expense limitation agreement with the Trust.  Pursuant to 
the expense limitation agreement, the Adviser has agreed to waive or limit its 
fees and assume other expenses of the Fund so that the Fund’s ratio of total 
annual operating expenses is limited to 1.95% until October 31, 
2010.  This limitation does not apply to interest, taxes, brokerage 
commissions, and other expenditures capitalized in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles or other extraordinary expenses not incurred in 
the ordinary course of business.

The 
Adviser will be entitled to reimbursement of fees waived or reimbursed by the 
Adviser to the Fund, subject to the limitations that (1) the reimbursement is 
made only for fees and expenses incurred not more than three years prior to the 
date of reimbursement, and (2) the reimbursement may not be made if it would 
cause the Fund’s annual expense limitation to be exceeded.  The 
Reimbursement Amount may not include any additional charges or fees, such as 
interest accruable on the Reimbursement Amount.

advisory contract is available in the Fund's Annual Report to Shareholders for

SECTION 
3-  HOW YOU CAN BUY AND SELL SHARES

YOUR 
ACCOUNT

Types 
of Accounts ― If you are making an initial investment in the Fund, you 
will need to open an account. You may establish the following types of 
accounts:

Individual, Sole 
Proprietorship and Joint Accounts.  Individual and sole 
proprietorship accounts are owned by one person; joint accounts can have two or 
more owners. All owners of the joint account must sign written instructions to 
purchase or redeem shares or to change account information exactly as their 
names appear on the account. If you elect telephone privileges, however, 
redemption requests by telephone may be made by any one of the joint account 
owners.
 











Uniform Gift or 
Transfer To Minor Accounts (UGMA OR UTMA).  Depending on the 
laws of your state, you may set up a custodial account under the Uniform Gift 
(or Transfers) to Minors Act. These custodial accounts provide a way to give a 
child up to $10,000 per year without paying Federal gift tax under the Uniform 
Gift (or Transfers) to Minors Act. To open a UGMA or UTMA account, you must 
include the minor's social security number on the application, and the 
custodian, or trustee, of the UGMA or UTMA must sign instructions in a manner 
indicating trustee capacity.

Corporate and 
Partnership Accounts.  To open a corporate or partnership 
account, or to send instructions to the Fund, the following documents are 
required:






* 

For 
      corporations, a corporate resolution signed by an authorized person with a 
      signature guarantee.






* 

For 
      partnerships, a certification for a partnership agreement, or the pages 
      from the partnership agreement that identify the general 
      partners.






* 

An 
      authorized officer of the corporation or other legal entity must sign the 
      application.

Trust 
Accounts.  The trust must be established before you can open a 
trust account. To open the account you must include the name of each trustee, 
the name of the trust and provide a certification for trust, or the pages from 
the trust document that identify the trustees.

HOW 
TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT AND PURCHASE SHARES

Once you 
have chosen the type of account that you want to open, you are ready to 
establish an account.

General 
Information ― The Fund does not issue share certificates. You will 
receive quarterly account statements and a confirmation of each transaction. You 
should verify the accuracy of all transactions in your account as soon as you 
receive your account statement. During unusual market conditions, the Fund may 
temporarily suspend or discontinue any service or privilege.

Purchasing 
Shares ― Shares of the Fund may be purchased directly from the Fund or 
through brokers or dealers who are authorized by the Distributor to sell shares 
of the Fund. Shares of the Fund are also offered through financial supermarkets, 
investment advisers and consultants, and other investment professionals. 
Investment professionals who offer shares may require the payment of fees from 
their individual clients. If you invest through a third party, the policies and 
fees may be different from those described in this prospectus. For example, 
third parties may charge transaction fees or set different minimum investment 
amounts.

Customer 
Identification Program ― Federal regulations require that the company 
through which you open an account obtain certain personal information about you 
when opening a new account. As a result, the company must obtain the following 
information for each person that opens a new account:






* 

Name;





* 

Date 
      of birth (for individuals);





* 

Residential  
      or business  street  address  (although  post  
      office  boxes are still permitted for mailing); 
  and





* 

Social 
      security number, taxpayer identification number, or other identifying 
      number.

You may 
also be asked for a copy of your driver's license, passport, or other 
identifying document in order to verify your identity. In addition, it may be 
necessary to verify your identity by cross-referencing your identification 
information with a consumer report or other electronic database. Additional 
information may be required to open accounts for corporations and other 
entities.

After an 
account is opened, the company may restrict your ability to purchase additional 
shares until your identity is verified. The company also may close your account 
or take other appropriate action if they are unable to verify your identity 
within a reasonable time. If your account is closed for this reason, your shares 
will be redeemed at the NAV next calculated after the account is 
closed.

Minimum Investments ― 
The minimum initial investment in shares of the Fund is $1,000. 
Additional investments must be in amounts of $250 or more. The minimum initial 
investment in retirement accounts (such as an IRA) is $1,000. Additional 
investments in retirement accounts must be in amounts of $250 or more. The Fund 
retains the right to waive the minimum initial investment or to refuse to accept 
an order.

Automatic 
Investment Plans ― You may invest a specified amount of money in the Fund 
once or twice a month on specified dates pursuant to an Automatic Investment 
Plan ("AIP"). These payments are taken from your bank account by automated 
clearinghouse ("ACH") payment. The minimum investment for an AIP is $100. To 
open an AIP account, call or write to us to request an "Automatic Investment" 
form. Complete and sign the form, and return it to us along with a voided check 
for the bank account from which payments will be made.

Transactions Through Third 
Parties ― 
You may buy and sell shares of the Fund through certain brokers (and 
their authorized agents) that have made arrangements with the Distributor to 
sell Fund shares. When you place your order with such a broker or its authorized 
agent, your order is treated by the broker as if you had placed it directly with 
the Fund, and you will pay or receive the next price calculated by the Fund. The 
broker (or authorized agent) is responsible for processing your order correctly 
and promptly, keeping you advised regarding the status of your individual 
account, confirming your transactions and ensuring that you receive copies of 
the Fund's current prospectus. The broker (or its authorized agent) may charge 
you a fee for handling your order.

How to Pay for Your 
Purchase of 
Shares ― You may purchase shares of the Fund by check, ACH payment, or 
wire. All payments must be in U.S. dollars.

Checks.  All 
checks must be drawn on U.S. banks and made payable to "Satuit Capital Micro Cap 
Fund." No other method of check payment is acceptable (for example, you may not 
pay by travelers check).

ACH 
Payments.  Instruct your financial institution to make an ACH 
payment to us. These payments typically take two days. Your financial 
institution may charge you a fee for this service.

Wires.  Instruct 
your financial institution to make a Federal funds wire payment to us. Your 
financial institution may charge you a fee for this service.

Limitations 
on Purchases ― The Fund reserves the right to refuse any purchase 
request, particularly requests that could adversely affect the Fund or its 
operations. This includes those from any individual or group who, in the Fund's 
view, is likely to engage in excessive trading (usually defined as more than 
four exchanges out of the Fund within a calendar year).

Cancelled 
or Failed Payments ― The Fund accepts checks and ACH transfers at full 
value subject to collection. If your payment for shares is not received or you 
pay with a check or ACH transfer that does not clear, your purchase will be 
cancelled. You will be responsible for any losses or expenses incurred by the 
Fund or the Transfer Agent, and the Fund may redeem other shares you own in the 
account as reimbursement. The Fund and its agents have the right to reject or 
cancel any purchase, exchange, or redemption due to non-payment. If we cancel 
your purchase due to non-payment, you will be responsible for any loss the Fund 
incurs. We will not accept cash or third-party checks for the purchase of 
shares.
 











In 
compliance with the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001, please note that the Fund's 
Transfer Agent will verify certain information on your account application as 
part of the Trust's Anti-Money Laundering Program. As requested on the account 
application, you should supply your full name, date of birth, social security 
number and permanent street address. Mailing addresses containing a P. O. Box 
will not be accepted. Please call 1-866-9-SATUIT if you need additional 
assistance when completing your account application.

If we are 
unable to verify your identity, as required by anti-money laundering laws, we 
may refuse to open your account or may open your account pending verification of 
your identity. If we subsequently are unable to verify your identity, we may 
close your account and return to you the value of your shares at the next 
calculated NAV.

HOW 
TO SELL (REDEEM) SHARES OF THE FUND

You have 
the right to sell ("redeem") all or any part of your shares subject to certain 
restrictions. Selling your shares in the Fund is referred to as a "redemption" 
because the Fund buys back its shares. The Fund's procedure is to redeem shares 
at the NAV determined after the Transfer Agent receives the redemption request 
in proper order, less any applicable redemption fee.  See "Redemption 
Procedures" below. We will mail your redemption proceeds to your current address 
or transmit them electronically to your designated bank 
account.  Except under certain emergency conditions, we will send your 
redemption to you within seven (7) calendar days after we receive your 
redemption request. During unusual market conditions, the Fund may suspend 
redemptions or postpone the payment of redemption proceeds, to the extent 
permitted under the Federal securities laws. Delays may occur in cases of very 
large redemptions, excessive trading or during unusual market conditions. If you 
purchase your shares by check, the Fund may delay sending the proceeds from your 
redemption request until your check has cleared. This could take up to fifteen 
(15) calendar days.

The Fund 
cannot accept requests that specify a certain date for redemption or which 
specify any other special conditions. Please call 1-866-9-SATUIT for further 
information regarding redemptions. WE WILL NOT PROCESS YOUR REDEMPTION REQUEST 
IF IT IS NOT IN PROPER FORM (SEE "REDEMPTION PROCEDURES"). HOWEVER, WE WILL 
NOTIFY YOU IF YOUR REDEMPTION REQUEST IS NOT IN PROPER FORM.

Redemption 
Procedures.

By Mail 
― To redeem shares of the Fund, your redemption request must be in proper 
form. To redeem by mail, prepare a written request including:






* 

Your 
      name(s) and signature(s);





* 

The 
      name of the Fund, and your account 
number;





* 

The 
      dollar amount or number of shares you want to 
  redeem;





* 

How 
      and where to send your proceeds;





* 

A 
      signature guarantee, if required (see "Signature Guarantee Requirements"); 
      and





* 

Any 
      other legal documents required for redemption requests by corporations, 
      partnerships or trusts.

Mail your 
request and documentation to:

Satuit 
Capital Micro Cap Fund
c/o/ 
Mutual Shareholder Services, LLC
8000 Town 
Centre Drive Suite 400
Broadview 
Heights, Ohio 44147

By Wire 
― You may only request payment of your redemption proceeds by wire if you 
have previously elected wire redemption privileges on your account application 
or a separate form. Wire requests are only available if your redemption is for 
$10,000 or more.

To 
request a wire redemption, mail or call us with your request. If you wish to 
make your wire request by telephone, however, you must have previously elected 
telephone redemption privileges.
 











By 
Telephone ― We accept redemption requests by telephone only if you have 
elected telephone redemption privileges on your account application or on a 
separate form.

To redeem 
shares by telephone, call us with your request. You will need to provide your 
account number and the exact name(s) in which the account is registered. We may 
also require a password or additional forms of identification.

Your 
proceeds will be mailed to you or wired to you (if you have elected wire 
redemption privileges - See "By Wire" above). Telephone redemptions are easy and 
convenient, but this account option involves a risk of loss from unauthorized or 
fraudulent transactions. We will take reasonable precautions to protect your 
account from fraud. You should do the same by keeping your account information 
private and by reviewing immediately any account statement and transaction 
confirmations that you receive. Neither the Fund nor the Transfer Agent will be 
responsible for any losses due to telephone fraud, so long as we have taken 
reasonable steps to verify the caller's identity.

Automatic 
Redemption ― If you own shares of the Fund with an aggregated value of at 
least $10,000, you may request a specified amount of money from your account 
once a month or once a quarter on a specified date. These payments are sent from 
your account to a designated bank account by ACH payment. Automatic requests 
must be for at least $100.

To set up 
periodic redemptions automatically, call or write the Fund for an "Automatic 
Redemption" form. You should complete the form and mail it to the Fund with a 
voided check for the account into which you would like the redemption proceeds 
deposited.

Signature 
Guarantee Requirements ― To protect you and the Fund against fraud, 
signatures on certain requests must have a "signature guarantee." For requests 
made in writing a signature guarantee is required for any of the 
following:






* 

Changes 
      to a record name or address of an 
account;






*

Redemption 
      from an account for which the address or account registration has changed 
      within the last 30 days;





* 

Sending 
      proceeds to any person, address, brokerage firm or bank account not on 
      record;





* 

Sending 
      proceeds to an account with a different registration (name or ownership) 
      from yours; or





*

Changes 
      to automatic investment or redemption programs, distribution options, 
      telephone or wire redemption privileges, any other election in connection 
      with your account.

An 
original signature guarantee assures that a signature is genuine so that you are 
protected from unauthorized account transactions. Notarization is not an 
acceptable substitute. Acceptable guarantors only include participants in the 
Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP2000). Participants in 
STAMP2000 may include financial institutions such as banks, savings and loan 
associations, trust companies, credit unions, broker-dealers and member firms of 
a national securities exchange.

Small 
Accounts ― If the value of your account falls below $1,000, the Fund may 
ask you to increase your balance. If the account value is still below $1,000 
after 30 days, the Fund will provide you with 60 days written notice in order to 
allow you a reasonable opportunity to increase the size of your account. If 
after the 60 days notice period, your account remains below $1,000, the Fund may 
close your account and send you the proceeds. The Fund will not close your 
account, however, if it falls below $1,000 solely as a result of a reduction in 
your account's market value.

Transferring 
Registration ― If you wish to transfer shares to another owner, send a 
written request to the Transfer Agent, Mutual Shareholder Services, LLC, 8000 
Town Centre Drive, Suite 400, Broadview Heights, Ohio 44147. Your request should 
include (1) the name of the Fund and existing account registration; (2) 
signature(s) of the registered owner(s); (3) the new account registration, 
address, Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number and how 
dividends and capital gains are to be distributed; (4) signature guarantees; and 
(5) any additional documents which are required for transfer by corporations, 
administrators, executors, trustees, guardians, etc. If you have any questions 
about transferring shares, call the Transfer Agent at 
1-866-9-SATUIT.

Lost 
Accounts ― The Transfer Agent will consider your account "lost" if 
correspondence to your address of record is returned as undeliverable, unless 
the Transfer Agent determines your new address. When an account is "lost," all 
distributions on the account will be reinvested in additional shares of the 
Fund. In addition, the amount of any outstanding (unpaid for six months or more) 
checks for distributions that have been returned to the Transfer Agent will be 
reinvested and the checks will be cancelled.











 
How To 
Contact The Fund ― For more information about the Fund or your account, 
you may write to the Fund at:
 
Satuit 
Capital Micro Cap Fund
Mutual 
Shareholder Services, LLC
8000 Town 
Centre Drive Suite 400
Broadview 
Heights, Ohio 44147

Or you 
may call toll free at 1-866-9-SATUIT.

Redemption 
Fee ― To discourage market timing, the Board has approved the imposition 
of a 2.00% redemption fee for shares redeemed less than 360 calendar days after 
purchase.  You will be subject to a 2.00% redemption fee if you redeem 
your shares less than 360 calendar days after you purchase them. If this fee is 
imposed it would raise the expenses of your shares. Such fees, when imposed, are 
credited directly to the assets of the Fund to help defray the expenses to the 
Fund of short-term trading activities. These fees are never used to pay 
distribution or sales fees or expenses. The redemption fee will not be assessed 
on certain types of accounts or under certain conditions.  While the 
Fund makes every effort to collect redemption fees, the Fund may not always be 
able to track short time trading effected through financial 
intermediaries.

Shares 
acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions are not 
subject to a redemption fee. The redemption fee is computed based a percentage 
of the NAV at the time the shares were purchased, net of reinvested dividends 
and capital gains distributions. The redemption fee would equal 2.00% of the 
offering price and of the net amount invested.

The Fund 
will use the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method to determine the 360 day 
holding period. Under this method, the date of the redemption will be compared 
to the earliest purchase date of shares held in the account. If this holding 
period is less than 360 days, the redemption fee will be assessed. The 
redemption fee will be applied on redemptions of each investment made by a 
shareholder that does not remain in the Fund for a 360 day period from the date 
of purchase.

If you 
purchased Class C shares of the Fund before July 25, 2008, and you redeem those 
shares less than two years from the date of purchase (regardless of such Class C 
shares having been converted to No-Load shares), you will be subject to a 2.00% 
deferred sales charge, and not the 2.00% redemption fee.  The deferred 
sales charge is computed based on a percentage of the NAV at the time the shares 
were purchased, net of reinvested dividends and capital gains 
distributions.  The deferred sales charge would equal 2.00% of the 
offering price and of the net amount invested.  In determining whether 
to charge a deferred sales charge, it will be assumed that you have redeemed 
shares on which there is no deferred sales charge first.

SECTION 
4-  GENERAL INFORMATION

DIVIDENDS, 
DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES

As a 
shareholder, you are entitled to your share of the Fund's net income and capital 
gains on its investments. The Fund passes substantially all of its earnings 
along to its investors as distributions. When the Fund earns dividends from 
stocks and interest from bonds and other debt securities and distributes these 
earnings to shareholders, it is called a dividend distribution. The Fund 
realizes capital gains when it sells securities for a higher price than it 
paid.

When net 
long-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders, it is called a capital 
gain distribution. Net short-term capital gains are considered ordinary income 
and are included in dividend distributions.

The Fund 
distributes dividends and capital gains, if any, annually.  All 
distributions are reinvested in additional shares, unless you elect to receive 
distributions in cash. For Federal income tax purposes, distributions are 
treated the same whether they are received in cash or reinvested. Shares become 
entitled to receive distributions on the day after the shares are 
issued.

If you 
have elected to receive distributions in cash, and the postal or other delivery 
service returns your check to the Fund as undeliverable, you will not receive 
interest on amounts represented by the uncashed checks. Long-Term vs. Short-Term 
Capital Gains:






*

Long-term 
      capital gains are realized on securities held by the Fund for more than 
      one year and are part of your capital gain 
  distribution.





*

Short-term 
      capital gains are realized on securities held by the Fund for less then 
      one year and are part of your dividend 
  distributions.











 
Taxes
Your 
investment will have tax consequences that you should consider. Some of the more 
common federal income tax consequences are described here but you should consult 
your tax consultant about your particular situation. Although it is not an 
investment objective, the Adviser will attempt to take into account the tax 
consequences of its investment decisions. However, there may be occasions when 
the Adviser's investment decisions will result in a negative tax consequence for 
the Fund's shareholders. For more detailed information regarding tax 
considerations, see the Fund's SAI.

Taxes 
On Distributions ― The Fund operates in a manner such that it will not be 
liable for Federal income or excise tax, provided that it distributes the amount 
required to avoid such taxes. Distributions, whether received in cash or 
reinvested in additional shares of the Fund, may be subject to local, state and 
federal taxes. Distributions of net investment income or short-term capital gain 
are taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions of long-term capital gain 
are taxable to you as long-term capital gain, regardless of how long you have 
held your shares. Under current law, certain income distributions paid by the 
Fund to individual taxpayers are taxed at rates equal to those applicable to net 
long-term capital gains (generally, 15%). This tax treatment applies only if 
certain holding period requirements and other requirements are satisfied by the 
shareholder and the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income 
received by the Fund itself.

The Fund 
will mail reports containing information about the Fund's distributions during 
the year to you after December 31st of each year (by January 31st).

Consult 
your tax advisor about the Federal, state and local tax consequences in your 
particular circumstances.

Taxes On Sales 
or Redemptions Of Shares ― The sale of Fund shares is a taxable 
transaction for Federal income tax purposes. Selling shareholders of the Fund 
will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference 
between the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares sold and the amount 
received. If the shares are held as a capital asset, the gain or loss will be a 
capital gain or loss.

"Buying 
A Dividend" ― All distributions reduce the NAV of the Fund's shares by 
the amount of the distribution. Unless your investment is in a tax-deferred 
account, you may wish to avoid buying shares of the Fund shortly before a 
distribution. If you do purchase shares prior to a distribution, you will pay 
the full pre-distribution price for your shares and then receive part of your 
investment back as a taxable distribution.

Tax 
Withholding ― By law, the Fund must withhold 28% of your taxable 
distribution and proceeds if you (1) have failed to provide a correct taxpayer 
identification number (TIN); (2) are subject to backup withholding by the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS); (3) have failed to provide the Fund with the 
certifications required by the IRS to document that you are not subject to 
backup withholding; or (4) have failed to certify that you are a U.S. person 
(including a U.S. resident alien).

The 
foregoing briefly summarizes some of the important federal income tax 
consequences to shareholders of investing in the Fund's shares, reflects the 
federal tax law as of the date of this prospectus, and does not address special 
tax rules applicable to certain types of investors, such as corporate, 
tax-exempt and foreign investors. Investors should consult their tax advisers 
regarding other federal, state or local tax considerations that may be 
applicable in their particular circumstances, as well as any proposed tax law 
changes.

NET 
ASSET VALUE

The 
Fund's share price, called its NAV, is determined as of the close of trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") (generally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on 
each business day that the NYSE is open (the "Valuation Time"). The NYSE is 
closed on the following holidays: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, 
Presidents Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, 
Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.  NAV per share is computed by 
adding the total value of the Fund's investments and other assets, subtracting 
any liabilities and then dividing by the total number of shares 
outstanding.

Shares 
are bought, sold or exchanged at the NAV determined after a request has been 
received in proper form. Any request received in proper form before the 
Valuation Time will be processed the same business day. Any request received in 
proper form after the Valuation Time will be processed the next business 
day.

The Fund 
reserves the right to refuse to accept an order in certain circumstances, such 
as, but not limited to, orders from short-term investors such as market timers, 
or orders without proper documentation.
 











If a 
security or securities that the Fund owns are traded when the NYSE is closed 
(for example in an after-hours market) the value of the Fund's assets may be 
affected on days when the Fund is not open for business. In addition, trading in 
some of the Fund's assets may not occur on days when the Fund is open for 
business.

The 
Fund's securities are valued primarily on the basis of market 
quotations.  Certain short-term securities are valued on the basis of 
amortized cost. If market quotations are not readily available for a security or 
if a security's value has been materially affected by events occurring after the 
close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded, 
then that security may be valued by another method that the Board believes 
accurately reflects fair value. A security's valuation may differ depending on 
the method used for determining value.

The Fund 
has a policy that contemplates the use of fair value pricing to determine the 
NAV per share of the Fund when market prices are unavailable as well as under 
special circumstances, such as (i) if the primary market for a portfolio 
security suspends or limits trading or price movements of the security and (ii) 
when an event occurs after the close of the exchange on which a portfolio 
security is principally traded that is likely to have changed the value of the 
security. Since most of the Fund's investments are in U.S. common stocks traded 
on U.S. securities exchanges, it is anticipated that the use of fair value 
pricing will be limited.

When the 
Fund uses fair value pricing to determine the NAV per share of the Fund, 
securities will not be priced on the basis of quotations from the primary market 
in which they are traded, but rather may be priced by another method that the 
Board believes accurately reflects fair value. Any method used will be approved 
by the Board and results will be monitored to evaluate accuracy. The Fund's 
policy is intended to result in a calculation of the Fund's NAV that fairly 
reflects security values as of the time of pricing. However, fair values 
determined pursuant to the Fund's procedures may not accurately reflect the 
price that the Fund could obtain for a security if it were to dispose of that 
security as of the time of pricing.

FREQUENT 
TRADING
Frequent 
purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares may interfere with the efficient 
management of a fund's portfolio by its portfolio manager, increase portfolio 
transaction costs, and have a negative effect on a fund's long term 
shareholders. For example, in order to handle large flows of cash into and out 
of a fund, the portfolio manager may need to allocate more assets to cash or 
other short-term investments or sell securities, rather than maintaining full 
investment in securities selected to achieve the Fund's investment objective. 
Frequent trading may cause a fund to sell securities at less favorable prices. 
Transaction costs, such as brokerage commissions and market spreads, can detract 
from the Fund's performance. In addition, the return received by long term 
shareholders may be reduced when trades by other shareholders are made in an 
effort to take advantage of certain pricing discrepancies, when, for example, it 
is believed that the Fund's share price, which is determined at the close of the 
NYSE on each trading day, does not accurately reflect the value of the Fund's 
portfolio securities. Funds investing in foreign securities have been 
particularly susceptible to this form of arbitrage, but other funds could also 
be affected.

Because 
of the potential harm to the Fund and its long term shareholders, the Board has 
approved policies and procedures that are intended to discourage and prevent 
excessive trading and market timing abuses through the use of various 
surveillance techniques. Under these policies and procedures, the Fund may limit 
additional exchanges or purchases of Fund shares by shareholders who are 
believed by the Adviser to be engaged in these abusive trading activities. The 
intent of the policies and procedures is not to inhibit legitimate strategies, 
such as asset allocation, dollar cost averaging, or similar activities that may 
nonetheless result in frequent trading of Fund shares. For this reason, the 
Board has not adopted any specific restrictions on purchases and sales of Fund 
shares, but the Fund reserves the right to reject any exchange or purchase of 
Fund shares with or without prior notice to the account holder. In cases where 
surveillance of a particular account establishes what the Adviser identifies as 
market timing, the Adviser will seek to block future purchases and exchanges of 
Fund shares by that account. Where surveillance of a particular account 
indicates activity that the Adviser believes could be either abusive or for 
legitimate purposes, the Fund may permit the account holder to justify the 
activity. The policies and procedures will be applied uniformly to all 
shareholders and the Fund will not accommodate market timers.

The 
policies apply to any account, whether an individual account or accounts with 
financial intermediaries such as investment advisers, broker dealers or 
retirement plan administrators, commonly called omnibus accounts, where the 
intermediary holds Fund shares for a number of its customers in one 
account.  Omnibus account arrangements permit multiple investors to 
aggregate their respective share ownership positions and purchase, redeem and 
exchange Fund shares without the identity of the particular shareholder(s) being 
known to the Fund. Accordingly, the ability of the Fund to monitor and detect 
frequent share trading activity through omnibus accounts is very limited and 
there is no guarantee that the Fund will be able to identify shareholders who 
may be engaging in frequent trading activity through omnibus accounts or to 
curtail such trading.
 











The 
Fund's policies provide for ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of current 
policies and surveillance tools, and the Board reserves the right to modify 
these or adopt additional policies and restrictions in the 
future.  Shareholders should be aware, however, that any surveillance 
techniques currently employed by the Fund or other techniques that may be 
adopted in the future, may not be effective, particularly where the trading 
takes place through certain types of omnibus accounts. As noted above, if the 
Fund is unable to detect and deter trading abuses, the Fund's performance, and 
its long term
shareholders, 
may be harmed. In addition, because the Fund has not adopted any specific 
limitations or restrictions on the trading of Fund shares, shareholders may be 
harmed by the extra costs and portfolio management inefficiencies that result 
from frequent trading of Fund shares, even when the trading is not for abusive 
purposes.

that rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the 
Fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions).  The 
Fund currently offers one class of shares.  Effective July 25, 2008, 
the Fund’s Class A shares, which commenced operations on December 12, 2000, 
became No-Load shares and the Fund’s Class C shares, which commenced operations 
on April 21, 2004, were converted to No-Load shares.  Certain 
information reflects financial results for a single Fund share. The total 
returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or 
lost) on an investment in the Fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and 
distributions). This information has been audited by Cohen Fund Audit Services, 
Ltd., an independent registered public accounting firm, whose report, along with 
the Fund’s financial statements, are included in the Fund's Annual Report to 
Shareholders (the "Annual Report"), which is available at no cost upon
