History[edit]
Progressive was founded in 1937 by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green as Progressive Insurance Company. Starting in 1956, the company found its niche insuring more risky drivers. In 1987, the sum of the company's written premiums breached $1 billion.[3] In 2016, that number crossed the $20 billion mark.[4] It has generally attempted to live up to its name by being innovative in the industry. It boasts being the first auto insurance company to have a website, allow customers to purchase policies via that site, and later to pioneer allowing the use of mobile browsers and smartphone apps for rating and managing policies.[5] It was also the first to offer 24/7 claims reporting.[6] As it has grown, Progressive has sought to be a one-stop insurance provider for families in order to more competently compete with other top-insurers.[citation needed]
Segments[edit]
The company operates in three segments: Personal Lines, Commercial Auto, and Other-indemnity. The Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, motorcycles, boats, and recreational vehicles through both an independent agency channel and a direct channel. The Commercial Auto segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by businesses primarily through the independent agency channel. The Other-indemnity segment provides professional liability insurance to community banks, principally directors, and officers liability insurance. It also provides insurance-related services, primarily providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans. In 2011, the company was ranked 164 in the Fortune 500.
Industry information[edit]
Progressive is one of the largest auto insurers in the United States, with over 13 million policies in force,[7] along with State Farm, Allstate, GEICO, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Farmers Insurance Group, and USAA. Progressive primarily offers its services through the Internet or by phone and through independent insurance agents. Progressive's Agency business sells insurance through more than 30,000 independent insurance agencies and progressiveagent.com where customers can quote their own policies and then contact an agent to complete the sale.
In December 2009, Progressive announced it was selling car insurance in Australia.[8] Initially called Progressive Direct, it rebranded as Progressive in 2011.[9]
Marketing and operations[edit]
Progressive's marketing campaign is known for offering quotes of its competitors along with its own quote. It was the first major insurer to offer auto policies through the phone and through its web site. In September 2007 Progressive began to offer Pet Injury coverage, which provides coverage for dogs and cats that are injured in a crash and is included at no additional cost with Collision coverage.[10]
Immediate Response Vehicles (IRVs) used by Progressive are specially modified Ford Explorers and Ford Escapes.[11]
Advertising[edit]




"Flo", a character from the Progressive Insurance TV commercials


Progressive's television advertisements feature an overly enthusiastic cashier named Flo (Stephanie Courtney), who explains the benefits of Progressive Insurance.[12][13] In December 2010, the company introduced the "Messenger", as a complementary campaign.[14]
In 2012, Progressive introduced another character, a personified box (Chris Parnell) representing the company's products. It is portrayed as having an entourage (including a personal trainer).[15]

According to a February 2011 Wall Street Journal article, Progressive has a leg up on its rivals in Pay As You Drive insurance, a form of vehicle insurance also generically known as usage-based insurance.[16] Progressive has seven U.S. patents covering usage-based insurance methods and systems, with more patents pending. Progressive began working on the concept in the mid-1990s and continues to refine the concept and bring it to the mass market.
Snapshot is Progressive's Pay As You Drive, or usage-based insurance program. Snapshot is a voluntary discount program where drivers can save money on their car insurance by sharing their driving habits with Progressive. According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day.[17] Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.[18]
Drivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they’re eligible for a discount based on that 30-day "snapshot" of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn’t take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.[18]
Snapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina.[17] Most recently, Snapshot became available in Indiana in May 2015.
Corporate sponsorship[edit]
On December 13, 2006, the company said earnings rose 58 percent in November as the company retained more of the premiums it collected because of comparisons to a month affected by Hurricane Katrina claims.[19]
In January 2008, Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the Cleveland Indians, was renamed Progressive Field. Progressive signed a 16-year contract for the naming rights, as well as sponsorship rights to become the Official Auto Insurer of the Cleveland Indians. The agreement costs around $3.6 million per year.[20] (Mayfield Village, Ohio, where the company is based, is a suburb of Cleveland.)
In March 2008, Progressive announced its title sponsorship of the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE and their funding of the $10 million prize purse. The Progressive Automotive X PRIZE is an international competition designed to inspire a new generation of viable, super fuel-efficient vehicles. The competition is open to teams from around the world that can design, build and bring to market 100 MPGe (miles per gallon energy equivalent) vehicles.[21]
On December 14, 2010, the Gator Bowl Association announced that Progressive Insurance would become the title sponsor for the 2011 Gator Bowl[22] college football bowl game.
Controversies[edit]
In 2002, the company settled with the State of Georgia in a class action lawsuit over diminished value claims brought by policyholders.[23]
In 2007, the company apologized after it was revealed they hired private investigators to infiltrate a church group and pose as congregation members to collect information on litigants seeking redress from the company. Another lawsuit was filed by the litigants over the affair against the company for invasion of privacy and fraud.[24]
In 2009, the company was sued for allegedly deceiving policyholders by employing illegally operated, unlicensed body shops to make repairs on vehicles for their clients in order to save money.[25] The court ruled in Progressive's favor on two of the counts and the other four were dropped, pending appeal.[26]
Also in 2009, the company was accused of ordering their advertisements off the air during the show broadcast of Glenn Beck on the Fox News Channel over comments made about U.S. President Barack Obama.[27][28] Progressive responded that they never authorized their ads to be aired during Beck's program, and they aired in that timeslot due to Fox's error.[29]
In 2012, the company was widely criticized online for how it handled the claims filed by the family of Kaitlynn Fisher. When Kaitlynn Fisher, 24, was hit and killed by a driver who ran a red light in Baltimore, Progressive fought to avoid payment due, with a policy that covered against the possibility of an accident with an underinsured driver. The driver was found to be negligent at trial with the Fisher family contending that Progressive provided legal assistance to the defense.[30][31][32]

History[edit]
Progressive was founded in 1937 by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green as Progressive Insurance Company. Starting in 1956, the company found its niche insuring more risky drivers. In 1987, the sum of the company's written premiums breached $1 billion.[3] In 2016, that number crossed the $20 billion mark.[4] It has generally attempted to live up to its name by being innovative in the industry. It boasts being the first auto insurance company to have a website, allow customers to purchase policies via that site, and later to pioneer allowing the use of mobile browsers and smartphone apps for rating and managing policies.[5] It was also the first to offer 24/7 claims reporting.[6] As it has grown, Progressive has sought to be a one-stop insurance provider for families in order to more competently compete with other top-insurers.[citation needed]
Segments[edit]
The company operates in three segments: Personal Lines, Commercial Auto, and Other-indemnity. The Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, motorcycles, boats, and recreational vehicles through both an independent agency channel and a direct channel. The Commercial Auto segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by businesses primarily through the independent agency channel. The Other-indemnity segment provides professional liability insurance to community banks, principally directors, and officers liability insurance. It also provides insurance-related services, primarily providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans. In 2011, the company was ranked 164 in the Fortune 500.
Industry information[edit]
Progressive is one of the largest auto insurers in the United States, with over 13 million policies in force,[7] along with State Farm, Allstate, GEICO, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Farmers Insurance Group, and USAA. Progressive primarily offers its services through the Internet or by phone and through independent insurance agents. Progressive's Agency business sells insurance through more than 30,000 independent insurance agencies and progressiveagent.com where customers can quote their own policies and then contact an agent to complete the sale.
In December 2009, Progressive announced it was selling car insurance in Australia.[8] Initially called Progressive Direct, it rebranded as Progressive in 2011.[9]
Marketing and operations[edit]
Progressive's marketing campaign is known for offering quotes of its competitors along with its own quote. It was the first major insurer to offer auto policies through the phone and through its web site. In September 2007 Progressive began to offer Pet Injury coverage, which provides coverage for dogs and cats that are injured in a crash and is included at no additional cost with Collision coverage.[10]
Immediate Response Vehicles (IRVs) used by Progressive are specially modified Ford Explorers and Ford Escapes.[11]
Advertising[edit]




"Flo", a character from the Progressive Insurance TV commercials


Progressive's television advertisements feature an overly enthusiastic cashier named Flo (Stephanie Courtney), who explains the benefits of Progressive Insurance.[12][13] In December 2010, the company introduced the "Messenger", as a complementary campaign.[14]
In 2012, Progressive introduced another character, a personified box (Chris Parnell) representing the company's products. It is portrayed as having an entourage (including a personal trainer).[15]

According to a February 2011 Wall Street Journal article, Progressive has a leg up on its rivals in Pay As You Drive insurance, a form of vehicle insurance also generically known as usage-based insurance.[16] Progressive has seven U.S. patents covering usage-based insurance methods and systems, with more patents pending. Progressive began working on the concept in the mid-1990s and continues to refine the concept and bring it to the mass market.
Snapshot is Progressive's Pay As You Drive, or usage-based insurance program. Snapshot is a voluntary discount program where drivers can save money on their car insurance by sharing their driving habits with Progressive. According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day.[17] Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.[18]
Drivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they’re eligible for a discount based on that 30-day "snapshot" of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn’t take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.[18]
Snapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina.[17] Most recently, Snapshot became available in Indiana in May 2015.
Corporate sponsorship[edit]
On December 13, 2006, the company said earnings rose 58 percent in November as the company retained more of the premiums it collected because of comparisons to a month affected by Hurricane Katrina claims.[19]
In January 2008, Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the Cleveland Indians, was renamed Progressive Field. Progressive signed a 16-year contract for the naming rights, as well as sponsorship rights to become the Official Auto Insurer of the Cleveland Indians. The agreement costs around $3.6 million per year.[20] (Mayfield Village, Ohio, where the company is based, is a suburb of Cleveland.)
In March 2008, Progressive announced its title sponsorship of the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE and their funding of the $10 million prize purse. The Progressive Automotive X PRIZE is an international competition designed to inspire a new generation of viable, super fuel-efficient vehicles. The competition is open to teams from around the world that can design, build and bring to market 100 MPGe (miles per gallon energy equivalent) vehicles.[21]
On December 14, 2010, the Gator Bowl Association announced that Progressive Insurance would become the title sponsor for the 2011 Gator Bowl[22] college football bowl game.
Controversies[edit]
In 2002, the company settled with the State of Georgia in a class action lawsuit over diminished value claims brought by policyholders.[23]
In 2007, the company apologized after it was revealed they hired private investigators to infiltrate a church group and pose as congregation members to collect information on litigants seeking redress from the company. Another lawsuit was filed by the litigants over the affair against the company for invasion of privacy and fraud.[24]
In 2009, the company was sued for allegedly deceiving policyholders by employing illegally operated, unlicensed body shops to make repairs on vehicles for their clients in order to save money.[25] The court ruled in Progressive's favor on two of the counts and the other four were dropped, pending appeal.[26]
Also in 2009, the company was accused of ordering their advertisements off the air during the show broadcast of Glenn Beck on the Fox News Channel over comments made about U.S. President Barack Obama.[27][28] Progressive responded that they never authorized their ads to be aired during Beck's program, and they aired in that timeslot due to Fox's error.[29]
In 2012, the company was widely criticized online for how it handled the claims filed by the family of Kaitlynn Fisher. When Kaitlynn Fisher, 24, was hit and killed by a driver who ran a red light in Baltimore, Progressive fought to avoid payment due, with a policy that covered against the possibility of an accident with an underinsured driver. The driver was found to be negligent at trial with the Fisher family contending that Progressive provided legal assistance to the defense.[30][31][32]

History[edit]
Progressive was founded in 1937 by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green as Progressive Insurance Company. Starting in 1956, the company found its niche insuring more risky drivers. In 1987, the sum of the company's written premiums breached $1 billion.[3] In 2016, that number crossed the $20 billion mark.[4] It has generally attempted to live up to its name by being innovative in the industry. It boasts being the first auto insurance company to have a website, allow customers to purchase policies via that site, and later to pioneer allowing the use of mobile browsers and smartphone apps for rating and managing policies.[5] It was also the first to offer 24/7 claims reporting.[6] As it has grown, Progressive has sought to be a one-stop insurance provider for families in order to more competently compete with other top-insurers.[citation needed]
Segments[edit]
The company operates in three segments: Personal Lines, Commercial Auto, and Other-indemnity. The Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, motorcycles, boats, and recreational vehicles through both an independent agency channel and a direct channel. The Commercial Auto segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by businesses primarily through the independent agency channel. The Other-indemnity segment provides professional liability insurance to community banks, principally directors, and officers liability insurance. It also provides insurance-related services, primarily providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans. In 2011, the company was ranked 164 in the Fortune 500.
Industry information[edit]
Progressive is one of the largest auto insurers in the United States, with over 13 million policies in force,[7] along with State Farm, Allstate, GEICO, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Farmers Insurance Group, and USAA. Progressive primarily offers its services through the Internet or by phone and through independent insurance agents. Progressive's Agency business sells insurance through more than 30,000 independent insurance agencies and progressiveagent.com where customers can quote their own policies and then contact an agent to complete the sale.
In December 2009, Progressive announced it was selling car insurance in Australia.[8] Initially called Progressive Direct, it rebranded as Progressive in 2011.[9]
Marketing and operations[edit]
Progressive's marketing campaign is known for offering quotes of its competitors along with its own quote. It was the first major insurer to offer auto policies through the phone and through its web site. In September 2007 Progressive began to offer Pet Injury coverage, which provides coverage for dogs and cats that are injured in a crash and is included at no additional cost with Collision coverage.[10]
Immediate Response Vehicles (IRVs) used by Progressive are specially modified Ford Explorers and Ford Escapes.[11]
Advertising[edit]




"Flo", a character from the Progressive Insurance TV commercials


Progressive's television advertisements feature an overly enthusiastic cashier named Flo (Stephanie Courtney), who explains the benefits of Progressive Insurance.[12][13] In December 2010, the company introduced the "Messenger", as a complementary campaign.[14]
In 2012, Progressive introduced another character, a personified box (Chris Parnell) representing the company's products. It is portrayed as having an entourage (including a personal trainer).[15]

According to a February 2011 Wall Street Journal article, Progressive has a leg up on its rivals in Pay As You Drive insurance, a form of vehicle insurance also generically known as usage-based insurance.[16] Progressive has seven U.S. patents covering usage-based insurance methods and systems, with more patents pending. Progressive began working on the concept in the mid-1990s and continues to refine the concept and bring it to the mass market.
Snapshot is Progressive's Pay As You Drive, or usage-based insurance program. Snapshot is a voluntary discount program where drivers can save money on their car insurance by sharing their driving habits with Progressive. According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day.[17] Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.[18]
Drivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they’re eligible for a discount based on that 30-day "snapshot" of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn’t take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.[18]
Snapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina.[17] Most recently, Snapshot became available in Indiana in May 2015.
Corporate sponsorship[edit]
On December 13, 2006, the company said earnings rose 58 percent in November as the company retained more of the premiums it collected because of comparisons to a month affected by Hurricane Katrina claims.[19]
In January 2008, Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the Cleveland Indians, was renamed Progressive Field. Progressive signed a 16-year contract for the naming rights, as well as sponsorship rights to become the Official Auto Insurer of the Cleveland Indians. The agreement costs around $3.6 million per year.[20] (Mayfield Village, Ohio, where the company is based, is a suburb of Cleveland.)
In March 2008, Progressive announced its title sponsorship of the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE and their funding of the $10 million prize purse. The Progressive Automotive X PRIZE is an international competition designed to inspire a new generation of viable, super fuel-efficient vehicles. The competition is open to teams from around the world that can design, build and bring to market 100 MPGe (miles per gallon energy equivalent) vehicles.[21]
On December 14, 2010, the Gator Bowl Association announced that Progressive Insurance would become the title sponsor for the 2011 Gator Bowl[22] college football bowl game.
Controversies[edit]
In 2002, the company settled with the State of Georgia in a class action lawsuit over diminished value claims brought by policyholders.[23]
In 2007, the company apologized after it was revealed they hired private investigators to infiltrate a church group and pose as congregation members to collect information on litigants seeking redress from the company. Another lawsuit was filed by the litigants over the affair against the company for invasion of privacy and fraud.[24]
In 2009, the company was sued for allegedly deceiving policyholders by employing illegally operated, unlicensed body shops to make repairs on vehicles for their clients in order to save money.[25] The court ruled in Progressive's favor on two of the counts and the other four were dropped, pending appeal.[26]
Also in 2009, the company was accused of ordering their advertisements off the air during the show broadcast of Glenn Beck on the Fox News Channel over comments made about U.S. President Barack Obama.[27][28] Progressive responded that they never authorized their ads to be aired during Beck's program, and they aired in that timeslot due to Fox's error.[29]
In 2012, the company was widely criticized online for how it handled the claims filed by the family of Kaitlynn Fisher. When Kaitlynn Fisher, 24, was hit and killed by a driver who ran a red light in Baltimore, Progressive fought to avoid payment due, with a policy that covered against the possibility of an accident with an underinsured driver. The driver was found to be negligent at trial with the Fisher family contending that Progressive provided legal assistance to the defense.[30][31][32]

Cleveland





Cleveland, Ohio is more than just our headquarters—it's our hometown. 




Look forward to coming to work
The headquarters consists of two main campuses in the suburb of Mayfield Village, along with several smaller offices in the area. Employees enjoy cafeterias, healthcare facilities, fitness centers with classes, onsite restaurants and convenience stores and quiet rooms to relax and refresh. 
Embrace diversity, thrive on support
The offices are also home to all our employee resource groups: The Progressive African-American Network; Progressive's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Network; the Progressive Latin American Networking Association; Progressive's Asian-American Network; and the Network of Empowered Women. These groups help foster a diverse and supportive work environment for all.
Our headquarters is the home of Progressive's Art Collection—the campuses and surrounding offices boast a wide variety of artwork. The art helps foster a spirit of creativity and innovation in the workplace.
Experience this plum of a city
Clevelanders embrace all the area has to offer. It's a dash of peaceful Midwest living with plenty of culture and excitement. 
The city boasts a theater district, a Museum of Art, the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, a world-renowned Orchestra and nightlife on East 4th Street.
The area has a couple of recreational gems. Lake Erie is the city's backyard, and offers watersports, fishing and miles of beaches. The Cleveland Metroparks is a network of 16 recreational areas—some just minutes from our campuses—with walking, biking and riding trails.

Progressive Careers: Hilda – Business Process ConsultantHilda, a Business Process Consultant at Progressive, talks about her job and why she loves working at Progressive.Copyright [2014 - 2017] Progressive Casualty Ins. Co. All Rights Reserved.



Video:
[Open on Hilda talking on the phone at her cubicle and laughing.]


Hilda:
[Text on screen: Hilda - Business Process Consultant] One of the reasons why I love working here is we celebrate diversity inclusion.


Video:
[Cut to a close up of a card on Hilda's desk that reads, "Celebration of Latino leadership at your Silver Spring Service Center." Cut to buttons pinned on her cube that say, "Yo soy Progressive," and "I Heart Insurance." Cut to a card pinned on her cube that says, "Toastmasters International.®"]


Hilda:
It is one of our biggest initiatives. And what better way to share with you that that's what I get to do everyday. I get to be myself. I get to bring my world view and different perspectives and know that it's valued.


Video:
[Cut to montage of Hilda laughing and joking with co-workers and hitting a toy button on her cubicle that reads, "Bundle".]


Hilda:
I started Progressive May of '96, and I've been able to grow with the company for the last 18 years.


Video:
[Cut to Hilda on the phone at her desk and a close up of a Flo bobble head.]


Hilda:
I am a Business Process Consultant in Workforce Management. What I love about my job is being able to impact the bottom line.]


Video:
[Cut to Hilda on the phone and working at her desk.]


Hilda:
Workforce Management exists to increase our ability to answer a phone call and making sure that we are here and available when our customers call and being able to influence that is amazing. My work environment is very flexible. I am able to balance my work and life, meaning, I am a single mom, and so sometimes I am called to assist with a PTA function or being able to take my daughters to a doctor. I'm able to work with my manager to be able to do that.]


Video:
[Cut to montage of Hilda working at her desk, a close up of a picture of her with her two daughters, and Hilda walking into the Progressive Health Services Tampa office.]


Hilda:
Part of my personal development at Progressive is to be able to leverage opportunities to learn other business areas.


Video:
[Cut to Hilda reading a book entitled, "Becoming a Resonant Leader."]


Hilda:
And a couple of different ways that I do that is being part of the Progressive mentor program, which allows me to mentor leaders within our organization, as well as explore different areas of the business that I normally wouldn't get to work with.


Video:
[Cut to Hilda talking to a co-worker and high-fiving him. Cut to Hilda putting on the white Progressive apron that Flo wears in the Progressive commercials and placing a pin on it that says, "I Heart Challenges."]


Hilda:
What's kept me here at Progressive 18 years is I love a challenge, and I feel challenged. My name is Hilda. I'm a Process Consultant, and I love what I do. Amo a Progressive.

We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation structure is very similar to the C Corporation, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that C Corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows C Corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?Outside of some state-specific regulations that require individuals to be 18 to own a business, there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation. However, if a corporation decides to elect for C Corporation status, there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership. They are as follows:• All C Corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the United States. • C Corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock. • C Corporation are limited to 100 different shareholders • Subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a C Corporation; all shareholders must be individuals.  What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?One of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a C Corporation is that the structure is eligible for pass-through taxation. Under this special tax status, the corporation is never taxed on its income. Instead, each individual owner is taxed on the company's profits and losses, as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level.

Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations.

The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

About Progressive Suspension

Ground-up custom? Rebuilding a barn find? Just dialing in your favorite ride? Progressive Suspension has a full line of shocks, cartridge kits, chassis stabilizers, lowering kits, fork springs, and components – including the appropriate pumps, gauges, and tools -- for bikes dating all the way back to the 50's. Progressive systems are lab-engineered and field-tested for ideal performance, and each component is rigorously inspected before it leaves the factory.
New fork springs and cartridges can improve your bike's handling by reducing fork dive, enhancing front end stability, and preventing bottoming out, all while smoothing out the small bumps. And Progressive shocks are preload adjustable, which means custom tunability for individual bike and rider weights. By utilizing varied spacing spring coils, progressive-rate springs become stiffer as they're compressed, resulting in a spring that is supple enough to soak up small bumps, yet firm enough to handle a big hit.
The bottom line is, you don’t know what good suspension is until you’ve ridden on it. Your bike will stop and turn better while keeping the straights nice n’ smooth.





Quick Fact
Choosing the right spring rate will make a big difference in how your bike responds to a Progressive suspension upgrade. With Progressive components, heavy-duty springs are best suited for solo riders over 220lbs. If you ride two-up and/or with a full load of luggage at least 50% of the time, heavy-duty shocks are also recommended.

History[edit]
Progressive was founded in 1937 by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green as Progressive Insurance Company. Starting in 1956, the company found its niche insuring more risky drivers. In 1987, the sum of the company's written premiums breached $1 billion.[3] In 2016, that number crossed the $20 billion mark.[4] It has generally attempted to live up to its name by being innovative in the industry. It boasts being the first auto insurance company to have a website, allow customers to purchase policies via that site, and later to pioneer allowing the use of mobile browsers and smartphone apps for rating and managing policies.[5] It was also the first to offer 24/7 claims reporting.[6] As it has grown, Progressive has sought to be a one-stop insurance provider for families in order to more competently compete with other top-insurers.[citation needed]
Segments[edit]
The company operates in three segments: Personal Lines, Commercial Auto, and Other-indemnity. The Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, motorcycles, boats, and recreational vehicles through both an independent agency channel and a direct channel. The Commercial Auto segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by businesses primarily through the independent agency channel. The Other-indemnity segment provides professional liability insurance to community banks, principally directors, and officers liability insurance. It also provides insurance-related services, primarily providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans. In 2011, the company was ranked 164 in the Fortune 500.
Industry information[edit]
Progressive is one of the largest auto insurers in the United States, with over 13 million policies in force,[7] along with State Farm, Allstate, GEICO, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Farmers Insurance Group, and USAA. Progressive primarily offers its services through the Internet or by phone and through independent insurance agents. Progressive's Agency business sells insurance through more than 30,000 independent insurance agencies and progressiveagent.com where customers can quote their own policies and then contact an agent to complete the sale.
In December 2009, Progressive announced it was selling car insurance in Australia.[8] Initially called Progressive Direct, it rebranded as Progressive in 2011.[9]
Marketing and operations[edit]
Progressive's marketing campaign is known for offering quotes of its competitors along with its own quote. It was the first major insurer to offer auto policies through the phone and through its web site. In September 2007 Progressive began to offer Pet Injury coverage, which provides coverage for dogs and cats that are injured in a crash and is included at no additional cost with Collision coverage.[10]
Immediate Response Vehicles (IRVs) used by Progressive are specially modified Ford Explorers and Ford Escapes.[11]
Advertising[edit]




"Flo", a character from the Progressive Insurance TV commercials


Progressive's television advertisements feature an overly enthusiastic cashier named Flo (Stephanie Courtney), who explains the benefits of Progressive Insurance.[12][13] In December 2010, the company introduced the "Messenger", as a complementary campaign.[14]
In 2012, Progressive introduced another character, a personified box (Chris Parnell) representing the company's products. It is portrayed as having an entourage (including a personal trainer).[15]

According to a February 2011 Wall Street Journal article, Progressive has a leg up on its rivals in Pay As You Drive insurance, a form of vehicle insurance also generically known as usage-based insurance.[16] Progressive has seven U.S. patents covering usage-based insurance methods and systems, with more patents pending. Progressive began working on the concept in the mid-1990s and continues to refine the concept and bring it to the mass market.
Snapshot is Progressive's Pay As You Drive, or usage-based insurance program. Snapshot is a voluntary discount program where drivers can save money on their car insurance by sharing their driving habits with Progressive. According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day.[17] Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.[18]
Drivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they’re eligible for a discount based on that 30-day "snapshot" of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn’t take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.[18]
Snapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina.[17] Most recently, Snapshot became available in Indiana in May 2015.
Corporate sponsorship[edit]
On December 13, 2006, the company said earnings rose 58 percent in November as the company retained more of the premiums it collected because of comparisons to a month affected by Hurricane Katrina claims.[19]
In January 2008, Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the Cleveland Indians, was renamed Progressive Field. Progressive signed a 16-year contract for the naming rights, as well as sponsorship rights to become the Official Auto Insurer of the Cleveland Indians. The agreement costs around $3.6 million per year.[20] (Mayfield Village, Ohio, where the company is based, is a suburb of Cleveland.)
In March 2008, Progressive announced its title sponsorship of the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE and their funding of the $10 million prize purse. The Progressive Automotive X PRIZE is an international competition designed to inspire a new generation of viable, super fuel-efficient vehicles. The competition is open to teams from around the world that can design, build and bring to market 100 MPGe (miles per gallon energy equivalent) vehicles.[21]
On December 14, 2010, the Gator Bowl Association announced that Progressive Insurance would become the title sponsor for the 2011 Gator Bowl[22] college football bowl game.
Controversies[edit]
In 2002, the company settled with the State of Georgia in a class action lawsuit over diminished value claims brought by policyholders.[23]
In 2007, the company apologized after it was revealed they hired private investigators to infiltrate a church group and pose as congregation members to collect information on litigants seeking redress from the company. Another lawsuit was filed by the litigants over the affair against the company for invasion of privacy and fraud.[24]
In 2009, the company was sued for allegedly deceiving policyholders by employing illegally operated, unlicensed body shops to make repairs on vehicles for their clients in order to save money.[25] The court ruled in Progressive's favor on two of the counts and the other four were dropped, pending appeal.[26]
Also in 2009, the company was accused of ordering their advertisements off the air during the show broadcast of Glenn Beck on the Fox News Channel over comments made about U.S. President Barack Obama.[27][28] Progressive responded that they never authorized their ads to be aired during Beck's program, and they aired in that timeslot due to Fox's error.[29]
In 2012, the company was widely criticized online for how it handled the claims filed by the family of Kaitlynn Fisher. When Kaitlynn Fisher, 24, was hit and killed by a driver who ran a red light in Baltimore, Progressive fought to avoid payment due, with a policy that covered against the possibility of an accident with an underinsured driver. The driver was found to be negligent at trial with the Fisher family contending that Progressive provided legal assistance to the defense.[30][31][32]

History[edit]
Progressive was founded in 1937 by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green as Progressive Insurance Company. Starting in 1956, the company found its niche insuring more risky drivers. In 1987, the sum of the company's written premiums breached $1 billion.[3] In 2016, that number crossed the $20 billion mark.[4] It has generally attempted to live up to its name by being innovative in the industry. It boasts being the first auto insurance company to have a website, allow customers to purchase policies via that site, and later to pioneer allowing the use of mobile browsers and smartphone apps for rating and managing policies.[5] It was also the first to offer 24/7 claims reporting.[6] As it has grown, Progressive has sought to be a one-stop insurance provider for families in order to more competently compete with other top-insurers.[citation needed]
Segments[edit]
The company operates in three segments: Personal Lines, Commercial Auto, and Other-indemnity. The Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, motorcycles, boats, and recreational vehicles through both an independent agency channel and a direct channel. The Commercial Auto segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by businesses primarily through the independent agency channel. The Other-indemnity segment provides professional liability insurance to community banks, principally directors, and officers liability insurance. It also provides insurance-related services, primarily providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans. In 2011, the company was ranked 164 in the Fortune 500.
Industry information[edit]
Progressive is one of the largest auto insurers in the United States, with over 13 million policies in force,[7] along with State Farm, Allstate, GEICO, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Farmers Insurance Group, and USAA. Progressive primarily offers its services through the Internet or by phone and through independent insurance agents. Progressive's Agency business sells insurance through more than 30,000 independent insurance agencies and progressiveagent.com where customers can quote their own policies and then contact an agent to complete the sale.
In December 2009, Progressive announced it was selling car insurance in Australia.[8] Initially called Progressive Direct, it rebranded as Progressive in 2011.[9]
Marketing and operations[edit]
Progressive's marketing campaign is known for offering quotes of its competitors along with its own quote. It was the first major insurer to offer auto policies through the phone and through its web site. In September 2007 Progressive began to offer Pet Injury coverage, which provides coverage for dogs and cats that are injured in a crash and is included at no additional cost with Collision coverage.[10]
Immediate Response Vehicles (IRVs) used by Progressive are specially modified Ford Explorers and Ford Escapes.[11]
Advertising[edit]




"Flo", a character from the Progressive Insurance TV commercials


Progressive's television advertisements feature an overly enthusiastic cashier named Flo (Stephanie Courtney), who explains the benefits of Progressive Insurance.[12][13] In December 2010, the company introduced the "Messenger", as a complementary campaign.[14]
In 2012, Progressive introduced another character, a personified box (Chris Parnell) representing the company's products. It is portrayed as having an entourage (including a personal trainer).[15]

According to a February 2011 Wall Street Journal article, Progressive has a leg up on its rivals in Pay As You Drive insurance, a form of vehicle insurance also generically known as usage-based insurance.[16] Progressive has seven U.S. patents covering usage-based insurance methods and systems, with more patents pending. Progressive began working on the concept in the mid-1990s and continues to refine the concept and bring it to the mass market.
Snapshot is Progressive's Pay As You Drive, or usage-based insurance program. Snapshot is a voluntary discount program where drivers can save money on their car insurance by sharing their driving habits with Progressive. According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day.[17] Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.[18]
Drivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they’re eligible for a discount based on that 30-day "snapshot" of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn’t take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.[18]
Snapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina.[17] Most recently, Snapshot became available in Indiana in May 2015.
Corporate sponsorship[edit]
On December 13, 2006, the company said earnings rose 58 percent in November as the company retained more of the premiums it collected because of comparisons to a month affected by Hurricane Katrina claims.[19]
In January 2008, Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the Cleveland Indians, was renamed Progressive Field. Progressive signed a 16-year contract for the naming rights, as well as sponsorship rights to become the Official Auto Insurer of the Cleveland Indians. The agreement costs around $3.6 million per year.[20] (Mayfield Village, Ohio, where the company is based, is a suburb of Cleveland.)
In March 2008, Progressive announced its title sponsorship of the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE and their funding of the $10 million prize purse. The Progressive Automotive X PRIZE is an international competition designed to inspire a new generation of viable, super fuel-efficient vehicles. The competition is open to teams from around the world that can design, build and bring to market 100 MPGe (miles per gallon energy equivalent) vehicles.[21]
On December 14, 2010, the Gator Bowl Association announced that Progressive Insurance would become the title sponsor for the 2011 Gator Bowl[22] college football bowl game.
Controversies[edit]
In 2002, the company settled with the State of Georgia in a class action lawsuit over diminished value claims brought by policyholders.[23]
In 2007, the company apologized after it was revealed they hired private investigators to infiltrate a church group and pose as congregation members to collect information on litigants seeking redress from the company. Another lawsuit was filed by the litigants over the affair against the company for invasion of privacy and fraud.[24]
In 2009, the company was sued for allegedly deceiving policyholders by employing illegally operated, unlicensed body shops to make repairs on vehicles for their clients in order to save money.[25] The court ruled in Progressive's favor on two of the counts and the other four were dropped, pending appeal.[26]
Also in 2009, the company was accused of ordering their advertisements off the air during the show broadcast of Glenn Beck on the Fox News Channel over comments made about U.S. President Barack Obama.[27][28] Progressive responded that they never authorized their ads to be aired during Beck's program, and they aired in that timeslot due to Fox's error.[29]
In 2012, the company was widely criticized online for how it handled the claims filed by the family of Kaitlynn Fisher. When Kaitlynn Fisher, 24, was hit and killed by a driver who ran a red light in Baltimore, Progressive fought to avoid payment due, with a policy that covered against the possibility of an accident with an underinsured driver. The driver was found to be negligent at trial with the Fisher family contending that Progressive provided legal assistance to the defense.[30][31][32]

History[edit]
Progressive was founded in 1937 by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green as Progressive Insurance Company. Starting in 1956, the company found its niche insuring more risky drivers. In 1987, the sum of the company's written premiums breached $1 billion.[3] In 2016, that number crossed the $20 billion mark.[4] It has generally attempted to live up to its name by being innovative in the industry. It boasts being the first auto insurance company to have a website, allow customers to purchase policies via that site, and later to pioneer allowing the use of mobile browsers and smartphone apps for rating and managing policies.[5] It was also the first to offer 24/7 claims reporting.[6] As it has grown, Progressive has sought to be a one-stop insurance provider for families in order to more competently compete with other top-insurers.[citation needed]
Segments[edit]
The company operates in three segments: Personal Lines, Commercial Auto, and Other-indemnity. The Personal Lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, motorcycles, boats, and recreational vehicles through both an independent agency channel and a direct channel. The Commercial Auto segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by businesses primarily through the independent agency channel. The Other-indemnity segment provides professional liability insurance to community banks, principally directors, and officers liability insurance. It also provides insurance-related services, primarily providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans. In 2011, the company was ranked 164 in the Fortune 500.
Industry information[edit]
Progressive is one of the largest auto insurers in the United States, with over 13 million policies in force,[7] along with State Farm, Allstate, GEICO, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Farmers Insurance Group, and USAA. Progressive primarily offers its services through the Internet or by phone and through independent insurance agents. Progressive's Agency business sells insurance through more than 30,000 independent insurance agencies and progressiveagent.com where customers can quote their own policies and then contact an agent to complete the sale.
In December 2009, Progressive announced it was selling car insurance in Australia.[8] Initially called Progressive Direct, it rebranded as Progressive in 2011.[9]
Marketing and operations[edit]
Progressive's marketing campaign is known for offering quotes of its competitors along with its own quote. It was the first major insurer to offer auto policies through the phone and through its web site. In September 2007 Progressive began to offer Pet Injury coverage, which provides coverage for dogs and cats that are injured in a crash and is included at no additional cost with Collision coverage.[10]
Immediate Response Vehicles (IRVs) used by Progressive are specially modified Ford Explorers and Ford Escapes.[11]
Advertising[edit]




"Flo", a character from the Progressive Insurance TV commercials


Progressive's television advertisements feature an overly enthusiastic cashier named Flo (Stephanie Courtney), who explains the benefits of Progressive Insurance.[12][13] In December 2010, the company introduced the "Messenger", as a complementary campaign.[14]
In 2012, Progressive introduced another character, a personified box (Chris Parnell) representing the company's products. It is portrayed as having an entourage (including a personal trainer).[15]

According to a February 2011 Wall Street Journal article, Progressive has a leg up on its rivals in Pay As You Drive insurance, a form of vehicle insurance also generically known as usage-based insurance.[16] Progressive has seven U.S. patents covering usage-based insurance methods and systems, with more patents pending. Progressive began working on the concept in the mid-1990s and continues to refine the concept and bring it to the mass market.
Snapshot is Progressive's Pay As You Drive, or usage-based insurance program. Snapshot is a voluntary discount program where drivers can save money on their car insurance by sharing their driving habits with Progressive. According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day.[17] Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.[18]
Drivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they’re eligible for a discount based on that 30-day "snapshot" of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn’t take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.[18]
Snapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina.[17] Most recently, Snapshot became available in Indiana in May 2015.
Corporate sponsorship[edit]
On December 13, 2006, the company said earnings rose 58 percent in November as the company retained more of the premiums it collected because of comparisons to a month affected by Hurricane Katrina claims.[19]
In January 2008, Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the Cleveland Indians, was renamed Progressive Field. Progressive signed a 16-year contract for the naming rights, as well as sponsorship rights to become the Official Auto Insurer of the Cleveland Indians. The agreement costs around $3.6 million per year.[20] (Mayfield Village, Ohio, where the company is based, is a suburb of Cleveland.)
In March 2008, Progressive announced its title sponsorship of the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE and their funding of the $10 million prize purse. The Progressive Automotive X PRIZE is an international competition designed to inspire a new generation of viable, super fuel-efficient vehicles. The competition is open to teams from around the world that can design, build and bring to market 100 MPGe (miles per gallon energy equivalent) vehicles.[21]
On December 14, 2010, the Gator Bowl Association announced that Progressive Insurance would become the title sponsor for the 2011 Gator Bowl[22] college football bowl game.
Controversies[edit]
In 2002, the company settled with the State of Georgia in a class action lawsuit over diminished value claims brought by policyholders.[23]
In 2007, the company apologized after it was revealed they hired private investigators to infiltrate a church group and pose as congregation members to collect information on litigants seeking redress from the company. Another lawsuit was filed by the litigants over the affair against the company for invasion of privacy and fraud.[24]
In 2009, the company was sued for allegedly deceiving policyholders by employing illegally operated, unlicensed body shops to make repairs on vehicles for their clients in order to save money.[25] The court ruled in Progressive's favor on two of the counts and the other four were dropped, pending appeal.[26]
Also in 2009, the company was accused of ordering their advertisements off the air during the show broadcast of Glenn Beck on the Fox News Channel over comments made about U.S. President Barack Obama.[27][28] Progressive responded that they never authorized their ads to be aired during Beck's program, and they aired in that timeslot due to Fox's error.[29]
In 2012, the company was widely criticized online for how it handled the claims filed by the family of Kaitlynn Fisher. When Kaitlynn Fisher, 24, was hit and killed by a driver who ran a red light in Baltimore, Progressive fought to avoid payment due, with a policy that covered against the possibility of an accident with an underinsured driver. The driver was found to be negligent at trial with the Fisher family contending that Progressive provided legal assistance to the defense.[30][31][32]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
