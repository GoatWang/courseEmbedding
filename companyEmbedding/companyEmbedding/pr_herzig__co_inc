P.R. Herzig & Co., Inc., 
                        managed since 1957 by its founding family, is 
                        a registered investment adviser and licensed 
                        broker-dealer that provides quality, independent 
                        investment advice and portfolio management to a loyal 
                        clientele of wealthy individuals, pension funds, 
                        trusts, charitable foundations and funds of funds seeking personalized 
                        and responsive service less readily available from larger financial 
                        institutions.
We are iconoclastic, value-driven, and independent 
                          thinkers; we do not chase market trends or 
                          popular investment "styles."
 
We invest our money alongside that of our clients; 
                          when our clients do well, we do well.
 
We value integrity; 
							we place the interest of our clients above our own.

Our Approach

 









Member 
        SIPC/FINRA


 

















































































We Invest Our Money Alongside Yours
Since 1957 we have managed money for 
                        wealthy individuals, pension plans, charitable 
                        foundations, funds of funds, the firm, and family members.
We Are Educated and Experienced
Our senior portfolio manager, Thomas Herzig, has 
						35 years of investing 
		experience. Two of us have Ivy League degrees. Four have CFA 
		designations. One of us formerly worked for the 
		SEC, one for a major U.S. bank, and one for a major brokerage firm.
We Are (Careful) Opportunists
We have been in the market too long to think any one approach works 
		forever, and tend to avoid the artificial distinction between value and 
		growth investing. If forced to choose, we would join the value camp. 
		Contrarians by nature, we often like stocks depressed by short-term 
		difficulties. We always seek a margin of safety in the price. Over the 
		years we�ve found that long-term success in investing comes as much from 
		avoiding large losers as in finding big winners.
We Tailor Our 
		Approach to Your Needs
We are investment professionals rather than �asset gatherers.� Unlike 
		many larger firms, we get to know the needs and wishes of each client, 
		many of whom have been with us for decades. And unlike mutual fund 
		holders, each of our clients knows exactly what holdings are in his or 
		her portfolio and can discuss them with us at any time.
We Keep Things Simple
We are structured as a broker-dealer and receive all our compensation in 
		the form of commissions on purchases and sales of securities. This lets 
		us keep administration to a minimum. Pershing LLC, one of the largest 
		U.S. clearing firms, with over $1 trillion in client assets, does our back 
		office work and holds your securities.
We Tell You the Costs
Many investment accounts, including those containing �house� funds sold 
		by major brokerage firms, are loaded with
						poorly disclosed costs 
		totaling 3% or more. Over time these annual costs take a huge bite out 
		of your capital. Generally the total investment costs paid by our 
						clients average between 1% and 1.5% of average invested 
						assets for accounts over which the Firm has investment 
						discretion authority and, in most cases, less for 
						non-discretionary accounts.
We Are Performance Oriented
We have tracked the �time-weighted� performance of individual
		accounts since the mid 1980s, long before it was common to do so.  Past performance, of course, does not
		guarantee future results. 

What 
                        is a CFA designation?
What is "time-weighted" 
                        performance?

We consider ourselves investment 
                        professionals rather than asset gatherers. We do not try 
                        to grow our business by selling investment "products."
                        
Instead, we focus on obtaining the 
                        best investment results we can for our clients, 
                        consistent with their individual needs and 
                        circumstances.
To measure our progress, we have tracked the 
						"time-weighted" 
                        net of fees performance of 
                        individually managed accounts since the mid 1980s, long before it 
                        was common to do so. 
Clients are encouraged to discuss with 
						us the long-term performance of their accounts. 
Past performance, of course, does not 
                        guarantee future results.

P.R. Herzig & Co., Inc., 
                        managed since 1957 by its founding family, is 
                        a registered investment adviser and licensed 
                        broker-dealer that provides quality, independent 
                        investment advice and portfolio management to a loyal 
                        clientele of wealthy individuals, pension funds, 
                        trusts, charitable foundations and funds of funds seeking personalized 
                        and responsive service less readily available from larger financial 
                        institutions.
We are iconoclastic, value-driven, and independent 
                          thinkers; we do not chase market trends or 
                          popular investment "styles."
 
We invest our money alongside that of our clients; 
                          when our clients do well, we do well.
 
We value integrity; 
							we place the interest of our clients above our own.
 
MOVING NOTICE
On July 7, 2016 we relocated to new offices in the same 
						complex. Our new address is:
 4 Expressway Plaza Suite 220
Roslyn Heights, NY 11577
Our telephone and fax numbers remain the same.
