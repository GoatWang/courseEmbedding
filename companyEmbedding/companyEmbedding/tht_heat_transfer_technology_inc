(NASDAQ:  THTI, "the Company", or "THT"), a leading provider of heat exchangers and heat exchange solutions in China's clean technology industry, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015.

Comment from Guohong Zhao, Chairman and CEO
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Guohong Zhao commented, "Our sales slightly decreased by 1.4% year-over-year to US$8.2 million and gross profit decreased by 4.7% to US$2.4 million. Our revenues usually decrease over each first quarter of the calendar years, with the first quarter usually the slowest quarter since fewer projects are undertaken during and around the Chinese spring festival.
"Along with the green actions supported by the Chinese government, we believe that our total solutions business model and ongoing investment in high technology of energy efficiency improvement and waste reduction will enable us to continuously increase our competitiveness and remain sustained growth."
First Quarter 2015 Financial Results
Revenue
Sales revenue for the first quarter of 2015 was US$8.2 million, or 1.4% decrease from US$8.3 million during the same period of 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales revenue from plate heat exchangers and shell-and-tube heat exchangers. Sales volume of heat exchange products was 362 units in the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of 134 units from 496 units in the same period of 2014. The decrease was due to the decreased demand of our products in consequence of fewer projects and economy slowdown of China in the first quarter of 2015 compared with the previous years.
For the first quarter of 2015, sales revenue from plate heat exchangers was US$1.8 million, a decrease of 37.5% compared with US$2.9 million in the same period of 2014. Sales revenue from shell-and-tube heat exchangers decreased US$1.1 million, compared to the same period of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, sales revenue from heat exchange units totaled US$3.9 million, an increase of 23.6% as compared to the same period of 2014. 
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales for the first quarter of 2015 increased 0.1% to US$5.8 million from US$5.8 million in the first quarter 2014. The increase was mainly attributable to the decrease in our sales revenue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit decreased 4.7% to US$2.4 million during the first quarter of 2015, from US$2.5 million in the same period of 2014, mainly due to the decreased sales revenue. Gross margin was 29.4% for the first quarter of 2015, as compared with 30.5% during the same period of 2014. The decrease in gross margin was mainly attributable to the decrease in our sales revenue.
Operating Expenses
Administrative expenses decreased 44.6% to US$0.3 million in the first quarter 2015, from US$0.6 million for the same period of 2014. The decrease was primarily owing to the decrease of allowance for doubtful accounts in the first quarter of 2015.
Research and development expenses decreased 37.9% year-over-year to US$0.2 million, from US$0.3 million in the first quarter 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the costs of research and development of new products.
Selling expenses decreased 16.2% to US$0.8 million for the first quarter of 2015, from US$1.0 million during the same period of 2014. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease of travelling expenses. This resulted in a 49.3% decrease in total operating expenses to US$0.2 million in the first quarter of 2015 from US$0.4 million for the same period of 2014. 
Income before Income Tax
Income before income tax was US$1.1 million in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 89.6% compared with US$0.6 million in the same period of 2014. The increase was mainly due to a decrease in our total expenses.
Income Tax
Income tax was US$0.2 million in the first quarter of 2015, compared with US$0.1 million in the same period of 2014. The increase was mainly attributable to the increased taxable income.
Net Income
Net income attributable to common shareholders was US$0.9 million in the first quarter of 2015, an 89.8% increase compared with US$0.5 million in the same period of 2014. The increase was due to the cumulative effect of the foregoing factors.
Basic and fully diluted net income per share was US$0.04 in the first quarter of 2015, compared with US$0.02 in the same period of 2014. 
Liquidity
As of March 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of US$9.2 million and restricted cash of US$0.7 million. During the first three months of 2015, there was a net cash outflow of US$3.1 million, compared with US$4.1 million in the same period of 2014. 
Net cash used in operating activities was US$0.7 million for the first three months of 2015, compared with US$1.9 million for the same period of 2014. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was mainly attributable to (1) increased net income; (2) decrease in trade receivables; (3) offset by decrease in other payables and accrued expenses.
Net cash used in investing activities was US$3,775 for the first three months of 2015, compared with net cash provided by investing activities of US$211,063 for the same period of 2014.
Net cash used in financing activities was US$2.43 million for the first three months of 2015, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of US$2.37 million for the same period of 2014. The increase in net cash used in financing activities resulted from more net payments to repay bank loans.
Outlook for Second Quarter 2015
THT expects to generate sales revenue in the range of US$9 million to US$12 million in the second quarter of 2015, compared with US$12.7 million in the same period of 2014. This represents the Company's preliminary view, and is subject to change.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

THT Heat Transfer Technology, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2011 Results

THT Heat Transfer Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:THTI, the Company, or THT), a leading provider of heat exchangers and heat exchange solutions in Chinas clean technology industry, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011. 
Third Quarter 2011 Financial Highlights 

Sales revenue decreased by 19.31% year-over-year to US$10.31 million. 
Gross profit decreased by 18.94% year-over-year to US$4.51 million. 
Gross margin was 43.75%, compared to 43.55% for the third quarter of 2010. 
Operating income decreased by 88.99% year-over-year to US$0.20 million. 
Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased by 92.17% year-over-year to US$0.12 million. 
Basic and fully diluted net income per share was US$0.01, as compared with net income per share of US$0.10 for the third quarter of 2010. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Guohong Zhao commented, This quarter we saw a decline in our net revenue as tightened credit within China led customers to delay their payment and delivery schedules. Although macroeconomic conditions adversely impacted our third quarter financial results and caused a buildup in inventory, we view this disruption as temporary and believe the strength of product lineup, robust pipeline and sound strategy will drive value in the long term. Contract value in the third quarter was up almost 32% over the same period in 2010, signifying that demand remains strong and we are well positioned for future growth as customers credit lines are restored. 
Taking the current credit environment into consideration, we expect fourth quarter 2011 revenue to be in the range of US$10 million to US$12 million. We are closely monitoring the situation and carefully evaluating clients payment and credit histories to ensure timely payment and maintain healthy accounts receivable levels. 
Third Quarter 2011 Financial Results 
Revenue 
Revenue for the third quarter 2011 decreased 19.31% to US$10.31 million, from US$12.78 million during the same period in 2010, primarily attributable to delays in the Companys delivery schedule. These delays were caused by credit-tightening within China, which adversely impacted customers financial positioning. 
Sales volume for the three months ended September 30, 2011 amounted to 645 units, a 58.31% year-over-year decrease from 1,547 units, attributable to the aforementioned delivery delays. 
Revenue from plate heat exchangers, or PHEs, totaled US$4.61 million, a 39.82% decline from US$7.66 million in the second quarter of 2010. Revenue from heat exchange units was US$1.40 million, a 31.91% decrease from US$2.05 million for the same period of 2010. In addition, sales revenue from shell-and-tube heat exchangers amounted to US$0.78 million in the third quarter of 2011, down from US$1.91 million during the same period in 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, sales revenue from the Companys new wide channel welded plate heat exchangers totaled US$1.37 million, as compared to no revenue contribution from this segment in the same period last year. 
Cost of Sales 
Cost of sales for the third quarter fell 19.60% to US$5.80 million from US$7.21 million in the third quarter 2010. This decrease was mainly attributable to the decline in sales volume for the third quarter of 2011. 
Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
Gross profit decreased 18.94% to US$4.51 million during the third quarter, from US$5.56 million for the same period in 2010. Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2011 increased to 43.75% from 43.55% in the previous period, driven by higher average unit prices as the Company improved its product mix. 
Operating Expenses 
Administrative expenses increased 0.25% to US$1.65 million in the third quarter, from US$1.64 million for the same period in 2010. 
Research and development expenses increased 21.09% year-over-year to US$0.37 million, from US$0.30 million in the third quarter 2010. The increase was mainly due to the Companys continued investment in the development of new products. 
Selling expenses increased 26.79% to US$2.30 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, from US$1.81 million during the same period in 2010, mainly attributable to an expansion of the sales team by 15 people and an average salary increase as a result of rising inflation in China. 
This resulted in a 14.74% rise in total operating expenses to US$4.31 million in the third quarter 2011 from US$3.76 million for the same period in 2010. 
Other income 
Other income amounted to approximately US$0.06 million in the third quarter, down from US$0.14 million in the same period in 2010. 
Loss/Income before Income Tax 
Loss before income taxes was US$0.09 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, down from US$1.78 million in income before income tax for the same period in 2010. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in sales revenue and other income. 
Income Tax 
Income taxes decreased to US$0.09 million in the third quarter 2011 from US$0.32 million during the same period in 2010. This decrease in taxes resulted from the decline in revenue and operating profits. 
Net Income 
As a result of the aforementioned, net income attributable to common stockholders decreased by US$1.44 million, or 92.17%, to US$0.12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, from US$1.56 million for the same period in 2010. 
Basic and fully diluted net income per share was US$0.01 in the third quarter 2011, compared with US$0.10 in the same period of 2010. 
Liquidity 
Cash and cash equivalents totalled US$3.30 million as of September 30, 2011 compared with US$5.15 million as of June 30, 2011. 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, net cash outflow amounted to US$15.13 million, compared with a net cash outflow of US$3.67 million in the same period of 2010. The change was mainly driven by an increase in cash used in operating and investing activities. Net cash used in operating activities was US$14.20 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, as compared with US$4.78 million in the same period in 2010. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was mainly due to prepayments for the purchase of raw materials and staff advances in the amount of US$8.09 million in anticipation of production requirements for the upcoming fourth quarter, an US$8.25 million increase in inventory, and a US$5.57 million rise in trade receivables. Net cash used in investing activities was US$5.59 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, as compared with US$0.76 million in the same period in fiscal year 2010. The net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was primarily used for the land use rights and purchase of equipment. 
Fourth Quarter 2011 Guidance 
In light of the current operating environment, THT expects to generate net revenues in the range of US$10 million to US$12 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2011, as compared with US$15.16 million in the same period of 2010. This represents the Companys preliminary view and is subject to change.

THTs senior management will host a conference call at 8:00 am (Eastern) / 5:00 am (Pacific) / 9:00 pm (Beijing) on November 22, 2011 to discuss the third quarter 2011 financial results and recent business activity. The conference call may be accessed by calling:

THT Heat Transfer Technology, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2015 Results






Nov 16, 2015, 8:50am EST
















SIPING, China, Nov. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- THT Heat Transfer Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:THTI, "the Company", or "THT"), a leading provider of heat exchangers and heat exchange solutions in China's clean technology industry, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015.
Third Quarter 2015 Financial Highlights

Sales revenue decreased by 20.7% year-over-year to US$12.6 million. 
Gross profit decreased by 54.2% year-over-year to US$2.6 million. 
Gross margin was 20.3%, compared with 35.1% for the third quarter of 2014. 
Operating income decreased by 93.8% year-over-year to US$0.2 million. 
Net income attributable to common stockholders was US$0.1 million, compared with US$2.0 million for the third quarter of 2014.  
Basic and fully diluted net income per share was US$0.01, compared with US$0.10 for the third quarter of 2014.  

Comment from Guohong Zhao, Chairman and CEO

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Guohong Zhao commented, "Our sales revenue decreased by 20.7% year-over-year to US$12.6 million and gross profit decreased by 54.2% to US$2.6 million, affected by the persistently sluggish demand for our heat exchange solutions along with the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty in China. The uncertainty has remarkable impact on some main industries we serve, such as petrochemical, metallurgical and shipbuilding industries.
"Combined with the green actions supported by the Chinese government, however, we believe that our strategy of focusing on high technology and high value added products will enable us to continuously increase our competitiveness and remain sustained growth."

Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results
Revenue
Sales revenue for the third quarter of 2015 was US$12.6 million, a 20.7% decrease from US$15.9 million during the same period of 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced orders of our products and the decrease in unit selling price of our products. Sales volume of heat exchange products totaled 1132 units in the third quarter of 2015. The average unit selling price of our products decreased 33.7 % compared with the same period of last year. The overall decrease was due to the decreased demand for our products in consequence of fewer projects and economic slowdown of China in the third quarter of 2015 compared with previous years.
For the third quarter of 2015, sales revenue from heat exchange units was US$3.4 million, a decrease of 58.9% compared with US$8.2 million in the same period of 2014. Sales revenue from plate heat exchangers was US$5.7 million, an increase of 14.3% compared to the same period of 2014. During the third quarter of 2015, sales revenue from air-cooled heat exchangers, shell-and-tube heat exchangers and others totaled US$3.6 million, an increase of 28.2% as compared to the same period of 2014. 
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales for the third quarter of 2015 decreased 9.1% to US$10.1 million from US$10.4 million in the third quarter 2014. The decrease was mainly in line with the decrease in the Company's sales revenue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit decreased 54.2% to US$2.6 million during the third quarter of 2015, from US$5.6 million in the same period of 2014, mainly due to the decrease in our unit selling price. Gross margin was 20.3% for the third quarter of 2015, as compared with 35.1% during the same period of 2014. The decrease in gross margin was mainly attributable to the decrease in our unit selling price.



Operating Expenses
Administrative expenses decreased 2.6% to US$0.85 million in the third quarter 2015, from US$0.87 million for the same period of 2014. The decrease was primarily owing to the decrease in bad debt expense in the third quarter of 2015.
Research and development expenses decreased 46.7% year-over-year to US$0.5 million, from US$0.9 million in the third quarter 2014. The decrease was primarily due to our decision to reduce research and development investment.
Selling expenses increased 2.9% to US$1.08 million for the third quarter of 2015, from US$1.05 million during the same period of 2014. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in freight expenses.
Income before Income Tax
Income before income tax was US$0.1 million in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease of 95.1% compared with US$2.6 million in the same period of 2014. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in our gross profit.
Income Tax
Income tax was US$-0.04 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared with US$0.5 million in the same period of 2014.
Net Income
Net income attributable to common shareholders was US$0.1 million in the third quarter of 2015, a 93.7% decrease compared with US$2.0 million in the same period of 2014. The decrease was due to the decrease in our gross profit.
Basic and fully diluted net income per share was US$0.01 in the third quarter of 2015, compared with US$0.10 in the same period of 2014. 



Liquidity
As of September 30, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of US$8.1 million and restricted cash of US$0.5 million. During the first nine months of 2015, there was a net cash outflow of US$4.1 million, compared with US$3.2 million in the same period of 2014. 
Net cash used in operating activities was US$5.6 million for the first nine months of 2015, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of US$6.9 million for the same period of 2014. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was mainly attributable to (1) decreased accounts payable; (2) decreased net income; and (3) less payments made for other payable and accrued expenses.
Net cash provided by investing activities was US$0.24 million for the first nine months of 2015, compared with net cash provided by investing activities of US$0.33 million for the same period of 2014.
Net cash provided by financing activities was US$1.31 million for the first nine months of 2015, compared with net cash used in financing activities of US$10.50 for the same period of 2014. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities resulted from a decrease in repayment of short-term loan in the amount of $14.26 million.
Outlook for Fourth Quarter of 2015

THT expects to generate sales revenue in the range of US$10 million to US$15 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with US$24.2 million in the same period of 2014. This represents the Company's preliminary view, and is subject to change.
