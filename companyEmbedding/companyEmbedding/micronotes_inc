Net Promoter® Score Measurement & Referral


















Measuring Loyalty At Scale & Identifying Brand Amabssadors
Financial Institutions, like most businesses, need to measure and improve customer loyalty – and compare current levels to competitive benchmarks.  Net Promoter® Score (NPS®) is a widely adopted method for measuring, comparing, and improving customer loyalty.  As NPS adoption has grown, so has digital banking, now reaching more than half of the entire customer base.  This presents a unique opportunity to move beyond statistical sampling to measure each customer’s loyalty and act.  
 
History of NPS
Net Promoter Score or NPS is a management tool that can be used to gauge the loyalty of a firm's customer relationships. It serves as an alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research and claims to be correlated with revenue growth.   
"Net Promoter Score" is a customer loyalty metric developed by Fred Reichheld of Bain & Company.  It was introduced by Reichheld in his 2003 Harvard Business Review article, "One Number You Need to Grow".    
Net Promoter Score (NPS) measures the loyalty that exists between a provider and a consumer. The provider can be a company, employer or any other entity. The provider is the entity that is asking the questions on the NPS®survey or interview. The consumer is the customer, employee, or respondent to an NPS survey.  NPS can be as low as −100 (everybody is a detractor) or as high as +100 (everybody is a promoter). An NPS that is positive (i.e., higher than zero) is believed to be good, and an NPS of +50 is considered excellent.  
Net Promoter programs are not traditional customer satisfaction programs, and simply measuring your NPS does not lead to success. Companies must follow an associated discipline to actually drive improvements in customer loyalty and enable profitable growth. They must have leadership commitment, and the right software and business processes in place to deliver real-time information to employees, so they can act on customer feedback and achieve results. 
 
Millions of Logout Opportunities Lost And Found
Instead of statistical sampling involving a relatively small number of customers from which inferences can be drawn and applied to all customers or members – Micronotes enables financial institutions to individually measure NPS for a significant fraction of the entire customer population. 
Micronotes harnesses digital banking logouts to interview customers on their willingness to recommend the bank or credit union to a friend or colleague, and why.  Instead of statistical sampling involving a relatively small number of customers from which inferences can be drawn and applied to all customers or members – Micronotes enables the bank to individually measure a significant fraction of the entire customer population, enabling the bank to act individually to correct specific problems with individual high value customers - and conversely, to request referrals from self-identified Promoters or brand ambassadors. 
 
How It Works
The Net Promoter Score is based on the fundamental perspective that every company’s customers can be divided into three categories: Promoters, Passives, and Detractors. NPS is based on a direct question:  “How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?”  The scoring for this answer is most often based on a 0 to 10 scale.  

Promoters are those who respond with a score of 9 or 10 - loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others, fueling growth 
Passives are those who respond with a score of 7 or 8  - customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings
Detractors are those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 - unhappy customers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative word-of-mouth

NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters;  Passives scores are ignored.   Micronotes automatically computes and reports NPS along with the reasons why promoters promote and detractors detract.  Individual reasons for detractors are provided to front-line employees and management teams for follow-up action.  Local office branch managers at Charles Schwab Corporation, for example, call-back customers to engage them in a discussion about the feedback they provided through the NPS® survey process, solve problems, and learn more so they can coach account representatives. The Micronotes NPS campaign automatically re-engages with detractors for follow-up conversation and invitation for a call-back – all at digital banking scale.  Conversely, the Micronotes NPS campaign, together with Micronotes Social™, enables the bank to retarget promoters in social media to help promoters – well… promote!      
The primary purpose of the NPS methodology is to evaluate customer loyalty to a brand or company, not to evaluate their satisfaction with a particular product or transaction, which is why Micronotes makes this measurement at enterprise scale. The ability to measure customer loyalty is a more effective methodology to determine the likelihood that the customer will buy again, talk-up the company and resist market pressure to defect to a competitor.

Micronotes Cross-Sell™



















Micronotes' FaceApp interface
More Engagement, More Revenue, Faster!
Micronotes Cross-Sell radically improves the productivity of bank cross-sell efforts by leveraging digital banking channel traffic to interview customers and deliver individually tailored offers for financial products without interfering with core banking functions. Micronotes Cross-Sell can engage the same number of customers in six months that it would take decades to reach with banner ads. 
 
Invitation to Communicate Effectively
Instead of a banner ad, we present an interview in mobile or online banking (not an offer) because we don’t know exactly what each customer wants until we ask.  The customer self-selects an offer by responding to simple questions in about 10 seconds, or no offer at all.  Interviews are powerful because sometimes mortgage conversations turn into HELOC or wealth management conversations.  In other cases, the customer may request a call about a mortgage — in Spanish!   
Regardless of the way the conversation proceeds, Micronotes automatically captures the segment information and acts on it. For example, a life events interview produces very different segments:
 








IP Address or Unique ID


Segment Detail




50.205.90.31


Customer/Member is buying a home in the next few months and requested help with a mortgage.




50.205.90.30


Customer/Member wants home insurance help; plans to buy a new house within a few months.




208.255.146.34


Customer/Member is buying a home in the next 6 months and requested help with a mortgage.




24.89.159.90


Customer/Member plans to retire within a month. Requested help with retirement planning.




63.139.88.82


Customer/Member is changing jobs and would like assistance moving their retirement funds from their old employer.






 




 Same interview - very different needs; each captured and handled in real-time. 
  
How It Works

Digital banking customers answer two to three questions about their situation and needs and select an offer, if appropriate
Micronotes automatically follows-up on leads with segment appropriate follow-up campaigns
Micronotes reports full funnel metrics, from impression to sale, in our campaign management console

A Completely Different Level of Engagement
Many financial institutions have given up on the digital banking channels as meaningful revenue generators given the essentially zero percent click-through rate of even the best targeted banner ads. Micronotes delivers engagement and cross-sell results that move the revenue needle.

Micronotes Predict™


















Anticipating Customer Needs and Intentions In a Digital World
Whether it's a weather forecast for mountaineers or a pregnancy prediction by Target's coupon marketing machine, good predictions matter. Good predictions are particularly important in cross-selling and retention where customers expect that the enterprise knows them – and the best way to demonstrate that you know your customers is to accurately anticipate their needs and intentions.     
Anticipating customer needs and intentions was easier when customers came into branches and talked to their bankers about their lives. Today, bankers have millions of digital breadcrumbs from which to piece together a life story.  This level of analysis and prediction just isn't possible with a spreadsheet, a pot of coffee, and a long night; machines have to do the work.   
 
How it Works
Micronotes Predict™ consumes the financial institutions’ marketing customer information file (MCIF) via a secure file transfer protocol (SFTP), joins that data file with a Micronotes interview response file – where available – processes the data using predictive algorithms, and outputs propensity values between zero and 1; which represent the probability that the customer will acquire a particular product based upon their unique attributes.  A file containing a score for each customer for each product is then sent to the financial institution for consumption by email, direct mail, and CRM based marketers – as well as being consumed by Micronotes Cross-Sell™, if installed. Predict learns by constantly using new user data and interview responses to systematically reduce targeting errors.  
Micronotes Predict™ cuts mortgage audiences to size to maximize revenue per customer interaction










 
 

Micronotes Retain™ predicts which attractive customers are at risk of attrition and take action to retain them
 
 










Better Customer Experience, Marketing ROI, and Retention
The value of a marketing campaign is equal to the value of good leads produced minus the cost of mistargeting.  All else being equal, reducing mistargeting improves both campaign value and customer experience, simultaneously.   For example, we’re able to improve the probability that a conversation will generate a mortgage sale by 76% using machine learning.  We generate fewer mortgage leads but more sales -- that's good for everyone.

Micronotes Social™


















Bridging The Gap Between Digital Banking and Social Media 
As the popularity of electronic banking and social media continue to grow, the opportunity to market to existing customers and leverage social media based referrals has never been greater.
Bridge the gap between online banking and social media, deepen customer relationships and supercharge referrals with Micronotes Social™.  Micronotes Social enables financial institutions to target customers in social media based on bank held data to broaden the bank’s digital footprint and cross-sell more effectively.  
Deepening relationships with existing customers is the most efficient way to achieve growth, yet realizing the full potential of cross selling has been difficult for most financial institutions. With the migration of customers to digital and social channels and with in-branch conversations becoming rare, the need to provide a coherent and relevant cross-channel digital experience has never been greater.
 
Digital Banking and Social Media Grow-Up… Separately 
An increasing number of customers are using online banking and social media to conduct their lives.  However, these two digital spaces are disconnected and lack coherence.  Wouldn’t it be rewarding if your banking provider used the data they already had to inform their social media advertising?  For example, if you explicitly told your bank that you were buying a car, wouldn’t it be nice to receive car buying tips in your Facebook or Twitter feeds?  Micronotes Social enables Financial Institutions to do just that: perceive a need, reason a solution, and act across channels automatically! 
 
Select and Target Existing Customers In Facebook® and Twitter® 
Advanced data analytics and digital interviews help financial institutions understand individual customer needs and target those with a propensity to buy.  However, leveraging those insights to reach existing customers on Facebook and Twitter has been difficult, given only a small fraction of the customers of financial institutions are Facebook Fans or Twitter Followers.   Micronotes Social enables financial institutions to target select existing customers for retargeting in social media.  For example, a marketer may wish to target all customers who have a high propensity for an auto loan or who explicitly said during an online conversation through the Micronotes platform that they were buying a vehicle soon.  Using Micronotes Social, that audience can be defined and retargeted in the Facebook News Feed as shown below:  

 
How Micronotes Social Works
Micronotes Social leverages the analytics, targeting, interviewing, and campaign management systems of Micronotes Cross-Sell™ to tag select customers for targeting or retargeting in Facebook and Twitter.     

An audience definition based on bank-held data and a social communication are created in Micronotes Campaign Manager and a campaign is launched 
Ad images and text are loaded into the Facebook and Twitter campaign management systems 
Select customers are automatically tagged for specific ads during online banking visits 
Tags are read by Facebook and Twitter and segment appropriate ads are rendered

In addition, Micronotes’ managed service system ensures that the financial institution’s staff doesn’t have to learn new software or manage content across social media sites; we do that all with the financial institution acting in an approval role.  
 
Better Targeting to Existing Customers Equals Better Engagement 
Micronotes Social complements Micronotes Cross-Sell by adding the power of social media to the channel mix. Banks and credit unions should expect materially higher click-through and conversion rates with Micronotes Social because of the super-relevant targeting of advertising to existing customers, who are inherently more likely to buy. 
 
Key Benefits 

Materially higher click-through and conversion rates for social media advertising
Targets existing customers in social media using bank-held data
Broadens financial institutions’ digital footprint into more existing customers’ social media experience
Leverages the power of social media to gain more referrals from existing customers through likes, shares, and retweets

Marketing Technology Firm Micronotes Releases Retain™ To Predict and Prevent Customer Attrition



Share Article

















Micronotes’ machine learning suite now offers banking providers the ability to predict which attractive customers are at risk of attrition and take action to retain them.






Cambridge, MA (PRWEB)
July 14, 2016
 Micronotes, a cloud-based marketing automation company for financial institutions, today announced the availability of its Retain™ learning machine that automatically scores attractive customers for attrition risk and initiates retention actions.   
Micronotes Retain addresses one of the biggest challenges facing financial institutions: How to retain desirable customers that are the targets of every other bank and fintech company?  
“10-12% attrition rates are a huge drag on earnings in financial services,” said Devon Kinkead, founder and CEO, Micronotes. “Banking institutions, both large and small, that solve the attrition problem become very valuable, like Logix, USAA, and Wells Fargo.  These firms deepen relationships with customers that are hard to break.  Micronotes uses machine learning and digital interviews to deepen customer relationships and that capability has now been extended to learn which profitable customers are likely to leave and automatically initiates retention actions.” 
Retain is available to Micronotes Cross-Sell™ Enterprise customers.  Micronotes Cross-Sell Enterprise™ provides bank marketers with the ability to engage customers through online banking, mobile banking, text, and social media with predictive marketing. The full cross-channel interview marketing system easily integrates with a bank’s email or CRM systems. Enterprise requires a data feed and installation.
Other products that are part of the Micronotes suite include: 
Micronotes Cross-Sell Basic™ allows bank marketers to easily and unobtrusively engage qualified customers online at logout using eight brief, high impact interviews. Since Basic requires no integration, banks can start interviewing their customers within 1 hour. 
Micronotes Cross-Sell Pro™ allows bank marketers to engage existing customers when they are banking online. Pro is installed on the high traffic secure-side of online banking where user identification is critical and facilitates personalized, secure, one-on-one online interviews based on user profiles and interview responses and then routes sales leads to the appropriate sales contact. Pro requires a data feed and installation by Micronotes.
More product information is available here: http://www.micronotes.com/products 
Across all of its products, Micronotes interviews typically take fewer than 12 seconds to complete and the average fraction of customers engaging in the interview process in any month is 32 percent.
Micronotes Cross-Sell is designed to serve small as well as large institutions and  starts at $200 per month.  Micronotes also offers a free-trial version of Micronotes Basic.   http://www.micronotes.com/micronotes-30-day-free-trial  
About Micronotes

The company’s fast, automated and cloud-based digital interview platform applies machine learning to customer data to improve customer engagement and effectively cross-sell financial products through the digital service channels.

John Shepard Reed
Chairman Emeritus of the MIT Corporation
John S. Reed attended Washington and Jefferson College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where, in 1961 under a joint degree program, he earned the BA and BS degrees. Mr. Reed worked briefly for the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company of Akron, OH, before entering the US Army where he served from 1962 to 1964 as a Lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, with service in Korea in the 45th Engineer Group, 8th US Army. Shortly after receiving his degree from the Sloan School, Reed was recruited by Citibank/Citicorp where he quickly moved up the ranks.  
During his 35 years at Citibank, Reed was central to modernizing the back office and creating the company's global consumer effort.  He ran the Operating Group and Consumer Group before becoming Chairman in 1984.  He led the company during the cross-border debt crisis of the 1980's, and the Real Estate problems of the early 1990's.  In 1998, Citicorp merged with the Travelers Corporation to form Citigroup, which he co-led until his retirement in 2000.  In 2003, after an upheaval over senior executive compensation, Mr. Reed was asked to take over the reins of the New York Stock Exchange.  Working for just a $1 salary, he served as NYSE Chairman from September 2003 until April 2005, during which time he helped put the crisis behind the institution, established new governance procedures, and brought in a successor.  More recently, Reed has voiced support for reforms intended to safeguard America's financial system. In June 2010, he was elected to serve as Chairman of the Corporation of MIT.
