Solid Teak Country Casual teak furniture is crafted from solid first-quality teak (Tectona grandis), a durable hardwood that performs beautifully in any climate.  Known for its superior performance in marine environments, teakwood is the ideal choice for outdoor furnishings.  Teak's high oil and rubber content give it weatherproof qualities forming natural barriers against the elements without sealers or treatment.  Solid teak construction, mortise and tenon joinery, and stainless steel fitting and hardware ensure Country Casual furnishing will last a lifetime.   See more: Ecological Statement »  Natural teak varies widely in color from blond to rich patterns of amber and brown.  Outdoors and untreated, teak will weather to silvery gray.  Teak requires no preservatives. Country Casual offers a variety of care and treatment products for other aesthetic options.   See more: Teak Care Guide »

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Zoro, Inc has received 4.32 out of 5 stars based on 37 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Our goal is to make the return or exchange process trustworthy and as simple as 1-2-3.RETURN POLICYIf for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you may return the item within 14 days of delivery of your order. For orders placed during the holiday season from November 15th to December 31st, the return period is extended to 60 days. The following rules apply:Products must be in original packaging and in a new and resalable condition.Any product that was used or fully/partially installed is non-returnable.Shipping Fees are non-refundable.All returns must be made via our Return Procedure by filling out an RMA form in the MY ACCOUNT section.There are few non-returnable products & services that may be offered on our website. It will indicate clearly in the product description if a different return policy applies.Order cancellations can only be requested prior to shipment or in some cases.If the return of an item was caused by an error on our or a manufacturer's part, we will cover the shipping fees.RETURN PROCEDURETo return a product, you must first request a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) that is located in the MY ACCOUNT section next to each order item that you want to return. The RMA form will include an exact return address and detailed instructions on how to return a product. Please allow 24 to 72 hours for processing your claim.EXCHANGE PROCEDUREThere are 2 ways you can go about exchanging a product:Option 1 (Slower) - Use the standard return procedure to request an RMA for the part you need exchanged. In your request please specify the exact item(s) you would like to exchange to. Upon receipt of your returned product we will process an exchange and ship the new part. If there is a difference in the price, you will be either refunded or charged the difference.Option 2 (Faster) - Order the new part online or over the phone so it can be shipped to you right away. Then request an RMA using a standard Return Procedure for the part you would like to return. Upon return of the part a refund will be issued promptly.DEFECTIVE, DAMAGED, OR INCORRECT PRODUCTSWe all know that accidents happen sometimes. If your product(s) will arrive defective, damaged, or simply incorrect, please contact our customer service department as soon as possible. Please do not attempt to use or install the part! We will send you a replacement part and provide you with a prepaid return label to return the defective part. Product(s) must be returned to us within 30 days. If the damage was caused by a shipping courier, we will schedule a damage pick up by the courier.When a replacement part is requested to be shipped prior to the return of original merchandise, we must temporarily authorize your credit card until the original merchandise is returned.ORDER CANCELLATIONSWhen you request a cancellation of an order or a part it may take up to 72 hours to process your cancellation claim. This process may involve voiding orders in computer systems, removing items from backorder logs, having operations personnel pull items from production schedules and sometimes stopping orders at the shipping dock. Also note that sometimes products ship more quickly than expected, so we recommend that you do not purchase alternative products until receiving final confirmation of your cancellation.REFUNDS & CREDITSAfter we accept your return, you will be issued a refund via the same payment method as you had originally used to place the order (Credit Card, Paypal, Google, eBillMe, or Check). The refund amount will be composed of the original purchase price minus shipping charges. You will be sent an email confirming receipt of the return and your credit. Please allow an additional 5-7 days for the credit to appear on your account.You might be interested in these items     Customer Questions & Answers  Be first to ask a question Login to ask a question             You might be interested in these items           Recently Viewed items                ~~MESSAGE~~          Ecco Products  LED Utility BarsEcco LightbarsDirectional LightbarsLED Minibar LightsStrobe Minibar LightsRotating Minibar LightsRotating Beacon LightsStrobe Beacon LightsLED Directional LightsConcealed LED LightsInside Window Mount LightsRemote Strobe Light KitsSelf Adhesive LED LightsLED Worklamps & SpotlightsHID WorklampsBackup Camera SystemsBack-Up AlarmsWarning AlarmsParts & Accessories  Replacement Light FlashtubesReplacement LED ModulesReplacement Light BulbsReplacement Light AssembliesReplacement Lenses & CoversLight Cables & ConnectorsMounting Hardware & PartsLight Guards & CoversLight Switches & Control BoxesBackup Camera Parts & AccessoriesQUICK INDUSTRY LINKS  AgriculturalConstructionBus & CoachTow TruckSchool BusMining Material HandlingWaste ManagementUtilitiesSnow RemovalMunicipalRecreational
