HALO’s Mission: Help Babies Sleep Safely
Our founder Bill Schmid and his wife Cathy lost their firstborn to SIDS. From this tragedy, HALO® and its mission were born. For nearly 20 years we've been dedicated to putting the health, safety and well-being of babies first. From our best-selling SleepSack® wearable blankets that help babies sleep safely, to our award-winning Bassinest® Swivel Sleeper that lets you sleep safely next to your baby, all we do comes from one core idea – putting babies first.

      This was my favorite baby item for both my girls. I felt so at ease knowing that my girls were comfortable, warm and safe in these soft and reliable sleep sacks. I have recommended them to everyone I know as they are much safer than sheets or blankets. These are very safe and the kids slept peacefully in them.

      These are my absolute favorite for my daughter. Keeps her warm and contained but she also likes having her arms from so she loves them. And you don't have to worry about them getting tangled in blankets or anything. Would definitely recommend to any parent.

      I loved using this for my little babies. It kept them warm but without me having to be paranoid over them being covered up with a blanket. They are very soft and my children both loved using these as infants.

      I love Halo sleepsacks. They work fantastic on my daughter who moves around a lot in her sleep. It's drafty in my house, but she is always toasty warm while staying safe by avoiding a blanket. They even gave us one at the hospital!

Nursery bedding collections to keep your baby comfortable When a new baby comes into a home, things are different. There are late-night feedings, for one, and taking extra precautions becomes part of the daily and nightly routine. However, even before the baby arrives, there are many changes that you need to make in your home. If you have the space   and many people have a room they use for storage or as a guest bedroom or a home office   you can create a nursery, which means plenty of fun decorating and stocking up on the essentials your baby needs to stay comfortable. Whether this is your first baby or your fifth, we have the nursery items, such as furniture, bedding and decorations, to create a special place for you and your baby, all available at our Every Day Low Prices. Here's what to consider as you're putting your nursery together. Cribs Probably the most important piece of furniture you can add to a nursery is the crib. Your baby will spend many of his or her first few months in the crib for much of the time. This means the crib should be of a high quality and be safe and secure for your baby to give you piece of mind. Cribs come in three general forms: standard cribs, convertible cribs and crib-and-changer combinations. There are portable or mini cribs available if you need to take the baby someplace overnight. Most of the cribs that are available have no drop-side feature, meaning the crib's sides are fixed all the way around. The majority are also made of wood or wood composite, although some are metal. Standard cribs are those that have a fixed bottom, meaning the mattress remains at the same level all the time. Convertible cribs, such as 3-in-1 cribs or 5-in-1 cribs, allow you to adjust the height of the mattress to different levels. Crib-and-changer combinations have a changing table that you place next to the crib. These feature a flat surface on the top that has raised sides all around. There are usually two or three drawers for storage, such as for diapers, towels and blankets or open shelving. Portable or mini cribs are smaller versions of both standard and convertible cribs, except these have casters on the bottom for easy movement from room to room. bassinets, cradles and Moses baskets serve much the same purpose. Most cribs don't come with a mattress, so you should look for one that fits the dimensions of your crib exactly. Some of the features to consider are the mattress's material and whether it's waterproof, orthopedic or reversible. A hypoallergenic mattress may be necessary if your pediatrician recommends it, and you may want to look for one that's made from organic materials to limit your baby's exposure to chemicals. Other Furniture If you don't choose a crib-and-changer combinations, then a changing table is a good addition to the nursery. These standalone tables tend to be larger than the ones connected to a crib, which means much more storage space. For spending time with your baby, a rocking chair, nursery glider or combination will be something both you and your baby can enjoy. The gentle rocking or gliding motion will help your little one relax and sleep better. Most nursery gliders come with a footrest for added comfort, but you can also purchase these pieces separately. If you need a lot of storage space for baby clothes, bedding and related items, a baby dresser is in order. You can even find some of our baby furniture as part of our Special Buys or Clearance items. Bedding Once you have the crib and mattress, the bedding is your next consideration. You can pick these items individually, but you can also save yourself some effort by selecting crib sheet sets or complete bedding sets. These sets typically come with three pieces featuring a crib sheet, dust ruffle and comforter, while some four-piece sets include a keepsake box for storage. Some even come with a matching blanket. A baby blanket makes a nice alternative to a comforter because they're a little softer and don t generate quite as much heat. An extra blanket is also nice when nursing or relaxing with your baby. changing pads protect your changing table from scratches or diaper leaks and keep your baby comfortable during the changing process. Leak-proof changing pad liners protect the changing pad. Decor You want to make sure the room is lit properly, but you want to avoid harsh, exposed lighting that can hurt your baby's eyes. Table lamps serve this purpose well, as do LED night lights that have an auto sensor. Mobiles that you place above the baby's crib make for nice decorations and can engage you baby's motor skills and grasping. Look for mobiles with a lot of color and varying shapes and heights. Wall decorations can serve a similar purpose.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167313236, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

HALO Bassinest Swivel Sleeper - Bedside Baby Bassinet for Safe Sleep

HALO – Safe Sleep for Babies








CLOSE 




Safer for Baby. Easier for You.
The HALO® Bassinest® Swivel Sleeper is the only bassinet that swivels to bring baby to you for close and safe sleep.
Now your little one can sleep as close to you as you want – even right next to you in bed – and still sleep safely in his own separate space. And the more it moves, the less you have to – which makes taking care of baby throughout the night a lot easier.
Watch our video to see why swivel is best!

A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation.

If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
