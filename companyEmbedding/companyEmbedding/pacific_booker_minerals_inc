Welcome to Pacific Booker Minerals


The Company
Pacific Booker Minerals Inc. (PBM) owns the Morrison property located in 
Central British Columbia, 35 km north of the Village of Granisle. 

PBM is in the advanced stage of development of the Morrison porphyry 
copper/gold/molybdenum deposit. PBM has completed a Feasibility Study and 43-101 
compliant Technical Report and is proposing an open-pit mining and milling 
operation for the production of copper/gold/molybdenum concentrate from the 
Morrison deposit. It is located within 29 km of two former producing copper 
mines, Bell and Granisle.

The Feasibility Study was completed by Wardrop Engineering Ltd., a Tetra Tech 
Company, with technical support of a team of other consultants. The study 
describes the scope, design features and financial viability of a conventional 
open pit mine with a 30,000 tonnes per day mill.

The highlights of the Feasibility Study are:

The total mineable reserve, classified as proven and probable, 
  at Net Smelter Return (NSR) cut-off-value of $CDN5.60/t, is 224.25Mt with an 
  average grade of 0.330% Copper, 0.163g/t Gold and 0.004% Molybdenum;

The overburden and waste total is 184.12 Mt for a strip ratio 
  of 0.82:1;

Recovered metal is 1.37 billion lbs Copper, 658,090 oz Gold 
  and 10.047 million lbs Molybdenum;

Mine life of 21 years;

Capital cost is estimated at CDN$516.68 million (including a 
  CDN$59.92 million contingency allocation); 

A projected exchange rate of C$1.00/ US$0.87;

Operating cost of CDN$8.15 per tonne milled over the life of 
  the mine;

Pre-Income Tax Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 20.05%, based 
  on metal prices of (four year trailing average as of January 12, 2009) Copper 
  $2.75, Gold $658.32 and Molybdenum $29.23;

Net Present Value (NPV) at 8.0% discount rate is CDN$495.9M; 
  and
  Payback period on capital is 4.2 years.


Note: Silver was not included in the financial analysis; however, there is an 
opportunity for improved economic performance if silver credits are received 
from the treatment and refining of the copper concentrate. Metallurgical 
test-work to date has reported silver present in the concentrate.



PBM has completed an Environmental Assessment and submitted an Application for 
an Environmental Assessment Certificate to the BC Environmental Assessment 
Office. 

The Environmental Assessment Certificate is required to apply for the various 
Licenses and Permits required for the construction, operation and maintenance, 
decommissioning, and reclamation of the proposed 30,000 tonnes/day open-pit mine 
over a proposed 21 year period.

PBM also submitted a number of permit applications for concurrent review with 
the Environmental Assessment Certificate Application, including: (1) the Mining 
Lease application, which grants mineral production rights from surveyed mineral 
claims; (2) two Licenses of Occupation, which grant surface rights for the use 
of Crown Land along the proposed Transmission Line and for an area in the 
proposed Tailings Storage Facility; and (3) various Forestry permits and 
licenses, which grant the right to cut timber on the mine site and along the 
proposed Transmission Line route, and grant permission to use forestry roads for 
mine access. 

Permits and Licenses are expected to be received in 2010 with mine construction 
to follow.

The Morrison deposit has the advantage of existing regional infrastructure to 
service the region, including a deep-sea shipping terminal at the port of 
Stewart, B.C., a road network, nearby hydro-electric power (20 km from the 
project site), two existing nearby forestry camps for preproduction use, and a 
full service town (the Village of Granisle) within daily commuting distance from

No regulatory authority has approved or disapproved the information contained in this website. This website includes certain statements that may be deemed "forward-looking statements". All statements in this website, other than statement of historical facts, that address future production, reserve potential, exploration drilling, exploitation activities and events or developments that the Company expects are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include market prices, exploitation and exploration successes, continued availability of capital and financing, general economic, market or business conditions. Investors should be cautious that any such statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

 






This web site also contains information about adjacent properties on which we 
have no right to explore or mine. We advise U.S. investors that the SEC's mining 
guidelines strictly prohibit information of this type in documents filed with 
the SEC. U.S. investors are cautioned that mineral deposits on adjacent 
properties are not indicative of mineral deposits on our properties.
 

Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - The United States Securities and Exchange 
Commission permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to 
disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally 
extract or produce. We use certain terms on this website (or press release), 
such as "measured,'' "indicated," and "inferred" "resources," that the SEC 
guidelines strictly prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their 
filings with the SEC. U.S. Investors are urged to consider closely the 
disclosure in our Form 20- F, File No. 0-51453, which may be secured from us, or 
from the SEC's website at
