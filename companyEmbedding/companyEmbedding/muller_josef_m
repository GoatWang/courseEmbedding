Early life[edit]
Born in Steinwiesen, Upper Franconia, he entered the legal profession after service as a mortar-man on the western front from 1916 to 1919. He was discharged as a senior sergeant.
He was a Catholic and during the Weimar Republic he became politically active as a member of the Bavarian People’s Party.
Third Reich[edit]
During the Nazi period he worked as an attorney defending many Nazi opponents. He also was part of the Catholic resistance and was in contact to resistance figures in the Abwehr (German military intelligence) such as Admiral Canaris, Hans von Dohnanyi and Hans Oster.
Missions to Rome[edit]
Main article: Pius XII and the German Resistance
Early in the war (1939–1940), Müller made a number of trips to the Vatican under the identity "X". He carried correspondence between the German resistance and British intelligence that sought co-operation in a coup to replace Hitler's regime with an anti-Nazi civilian government supported by the German military. The correspondence and related intelligence passed through an intermediary to the hands of Pope Pius XII, who would review it and in turn forward it to Lord Halifax in Britain. Dohnanyi summarized the material into a report, containing list of individuals slated to assume roles in a post-coup civilian government. Despite Müller's urgings, Dohnanyi failed to destroy this document and during the purges following the failed assassination attempt on Hitler in July 1944, it fell into the hands of the Gestapo, which led to the arrests, trials and executions of many resistance members.
The Pope's Private Secretary, Robert Leiber acted at the intermediary for Pius and met with Müller, who visited Rome in 1939 and 1940.[2] The Vatican considered Müller to be a representative of Colonel-General Beck and agreed to offer the machinery for mediation between the German Resistance and the Allies.[3][4] Hans Oster, Wilhelm Canaris and Hans von Dohnányi, backed by Beck, told Müller to ask Pius to ascertain whether the British would enter negotiations with the German opposition which wanted to overthrow Hitler. The British agreed to negotiate, provided the Vatican could vouch for the opposition's representative. Pius, communicating with Britain's Francis d'Arcy Osborne, channelled communications back and forth in secrecy.[3] The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with England and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Halder and Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.[5] Negotiations were tense, with a Western offensive expected, and on the basis that substantive negotiations could only follow the replacement of the Hitler regime. The British government had doubts as to the capacity of the conspirators. Nevertheless, the resistance were encouraged by the talks, and Muller told Leiber that a coup would occur in February. Pius appeared to continue to hope for a coup in Germany into March 1940.[6] The negotiations ultimately proved fruitless. Hitler's swift victories over France and the Low Countries deflated the will of the German military to resist Hitler. Muller was arrested during the Nazis first raid on Military Intelligence in 1943. He spent the rest of the war in concentration camps, ending up at Dachau.[7]
Imprisonment[edit]
After his arrest in 1943 he was interned at the concentration camp Flossenbürg. Unlike fellow inmates Canaris, Oster and Bonhoeffer, who were executed in April 1945, Müller was spared at the last moment, at the foot of the scaffold, through the intervention of Johann Rattenhuber who convinced Ernst Kaltenbrunner that keeping Müller alive might help Germany negotiate more favorable surrender terms. [8] Instead, Müller was transferred to Tyrol in late April 1945 along with 138 other "special prisoners" (Sonderhäftlinge) and "kin prisoners" (Sippenhäftlinge), persons of prominence the Nazi SS had hauled off in the final days of the war to Niederdorf, South Tyrol, where they were to be hidden and used as bargaining chips.[9] They were liberated by the Fifth U.S. Army on 5 May 1945.[10]
Post-war period[edit]
After the war, he advocated forming a new Christian party of both Catholics and Protestants. With Adam Stegerwald, he was one of the founders of the Christian Social Union (CSU), serving as the party's first chairman from 1946 to 1949. Müller belonged to the more liberal wing of the party and was the main opponent of the strictly conservative wing under Alois Hundhammer. He was one of the patrons of the young Franz Josef Strauß.
After the CSU had won the first post-war elections in 1946, Hundhammer opposed Müller's nomination as minister-president of Bavaria and proposed that Hans Ehard be elected as a compromise candidate instead. Once elected, Ehard appointed Hundhammer as minister of culture, but in 1947 Müller entered the cabinet as well as minister of justice. From 1950 onwards, he also was deputy prime minister. He resigned from the government in 1952.
He died on 12 September 1979, in Munich.

Early life[edit]
Born in Steinwiesen, Upper Franconia, he entered the legal profession after service as a mortar-man on the western front from 1916 to 1919. He was discharged as a senior sergeant.
He was a Catholic and during the Weimar Republic he became politically active as a member of the Bavarian People’s Party.
Third Reich[edit]
During the Nazi period he worked as an attorney defending many Nazi opponents. He also was part of the Catholic resistance and was in contact to resistance figures in the Abwehr (German military intelligence) such as Admiral Canaris, Hans von Dohnanyi and Hans Oster.
Missions to Rome[edit]
Main article: Pius XII and the German Resistance
Early in the war (1939–1940), Müller made a number of trips to the Vatican under the identity "X". He carried correspondence between the German resistance and British intelligence that sought co-operation in a coup to replace Hitler's regime with an anti-Nazi civilian government supported by the German military. The correspondence and related intelligence passed through an intermediary to the hands of Pope Pius XII, who would review it and in turn forward it to Lord Halifax in Britain. Dohnanyi summarized the material into a report, containing list of individuals slated to assume roles in a post-coup civilian government. Despite Müller's urgings, Dohnanyi failed to destroy this document and during the purges following the failed assassination attempt on Hitler in July 1944, it fell into the hands of the Gestapo, which led to the arrests, trials and executions of many resistance members.
The Pope's Private Secretary, Robert Leiber acted at the intermediary for Pius and met with Müller, who visited Rome in 1939 and 1940.[2] The Vatican considered Müller to be a representative of Colonel-General Beck and agreed to offer the machinery for mediation between the German Resistance and the Allies.[3][4] Hans Oster, Wilhelm Canaris and Hans von Dohnányi, backed by Beck, told Müller to ask Pius to ascertain whether the British would enter negotiations with the German opposition which wanted to overthrow Hitler. The British agreed to negotiate, provided the Vatican could vouch for the opposition's representative. Pius, communicating with Britain's Francis d'Arcy Osborne, channelled communications back and forth in secrecy.[3] The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with England and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Halder and Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.[5] Negotiations were tense, with a Western offensive expected, and on the basis that substantive negotiations could only follow the replacement of the Hitler regime. The British government had doubts as to the capacity of the conspirators. Nevertheless, the resistance were encouraged by the talks, and Muller told Leiber that a coup would occur in February. Pius appeared to continue to hope for a coup in Germany into March 1940.[6] The negotiations ultimately proved fruitless. Hitler's swift victories over France and the Low Countries deflated the will of the German military to resist Hitler. Muller was arrested during the Nazis first raid on Military Intelligence in 1943. He spent the rest of the war in concentration camps, ending up at Dachau.[7]
Imprisonment[edit]
After his arrest in 1943 he was interned at the concentration camp Flossenbürg. Unlike fellow inmates Canaris, Oster and Bonhoeffer, who were executed in April 1945, Müller was spared at the last moment, at the foot of the scaffold, through the intervention of Johann Rattenhuber who convinced Ernst Kaltenbrunner that keeping Müller alive might help Germany negotiate more favorable surrender terms. [8] Instead, Müller was transferred to Tyrol in late April 1945 along with 138 other "special prisoners" (Sonderhäftlinge) and "kin prisoners" (Sippenhäftlinge), persons of prominence the Nazi SS had hauled off in the final days of the war to Niederdorf, South Tyrol, where they were to be hidden and used as bargaining chips.[9] They were liberated by the Fifth U.S. Army on 5 May 1945.[10]
Post-war period[edit]
After the war, he advocated forming a new Christian party of both Catholics and Protestants. With Adam Stegerwald, he was one of the founders of the Christian Social Union (CSU), serving as the party's first chairman from 1946 to 1949. Müller belonged to the more liberal wing of the party and was the main opponent of the strictly conservative wing under Alois Hundhammer. He was one of the patrons of the young Franz Josef Strauß.
After the CSU had won the first post-war elections in 1946, Hundhammer opposed Müller's nomination as minister-president of Bavaria and proposed that Hans Ehard be elected as a compromise candidate instead. Once elected, Ehard appointed Hundhammer as minister of culture, but in 1947 Müller entered the cabinet as well as minister of justice. From 1950 onwards, he also was deputy prime minister. He resigned from the government in 1952.
He died on 12 September 1979, in Munich.

Josef M. Mueller, Former Head of Nestle in the Greater China Region, joins IMD as Executive-in-Residence





         

Back to last visited page
 






Josef M. Mueller earned his MBA at IMD in 1976. Following his illustrious and distinguished international career with Nestlé, Mueller now has been invited to join IMD as an Executive-in-Residence to share some of his knowledge and experience, particularly with regard to global business in China and other Asian markets.

“I have been associated with IMD for over 30 years,” Mueller said. “I feel inspired to give back and share my learning and insights with the next generation through IMD.”

The Swiss native joined the Nestlé Group in 1972 and continuously worked his way up to senior management positions within the international organization. Out of his 35 years with Nestlé, he spent 28 years in Asia, including 19 in the Greater China Region. Along with serving as President of the IMD Alumni Network in China, he has also maintained close ties to IMD over the last three decades by participating in executive programs and by sponsoring many participants to various IMD executive programs.

“As I have seen first-hand throughout my interesting international career, learning is a continuous process,” he said. “I am a firm believer in IMD’s unique approach to Real World, Real Learning.”

In autumn 2007, Mueller took his well deserved retirement from Nestlé. During the last nine years, he headed Nestlé in the Greater China Region, which has continuously generated sustainable profitable growth. Nestlé in the Greater China Region currently employs over 13,000 permanent staff and operates 21 factories and two research centers as of 2008. As Executive-in-Residence, Mueller will bring his valuable insights to Faculty, participants and partnership programs.

“I am looking forward to complementing IMD’s Faculty in bringing practical, real life business discussions to the classroom,” Mueller said. “At the same time, I will be able to remain on alert and to keep up to date with the latest in academia.”

Mueller will participate in research activities aligned with IMD, potentially through the China Research Center based in Lausanne, which looks at challenges broadly both from a functional and leadership perspective.

“In today’s China, we are witnessing the ‘unexperienced experience’. China is a fascinating and challenging country where a huge new market with the size and magnitude of a large continent is rapidly emerging. China is similar to a continental cluster of many markets. As it experiences this current unprecedented growth, so too will the global economy. It is important to look at this as a great opportunity – not a threat. The entire business community needs to be more proactively engaged in this process.”

According to Mueller, who has a great passion for doing business in China and Asia at large, a proactive and entrepreneurial spirit, pragmatic risk-taking and a “can do” attitude with the ability to rapidly adjust to the dynamics of a very competitive market are some of the keys to success for doing business in China.

“It is imperative to live and learn in a constantly and dramatically changing environment at a high speed,” he said. “Mainly due to China’s diversity and magnitude, complexity and pace, there really isn’t a previous model to follow. Getting information is one thing, but what is essential is rapidly converting this information into meaningful knowledge and speedy actions as part of a sound and sustainable overall strategy. I will try to provoke thinking in this regard.”

Along with the research and teaching opportunities, Mueller will also help represent IMD at a number of functions in Asia, including Business Forums and Alumni events.

“I hope to bring Asia and in particular China closer to IMD, while at the same time to bring IMD closer to China and Asia.”

“Joe has been one of IMD’s greatest supporters in Asia throughout the years,” said Richard Francis, IMD Vice President for Russia, Eastern Europe and Greater China. “It is wonderful that he will continue to use his experience of Asia for IMD. This is a tremendous opportunity for us.”

“It is essential to have a complete understanding of the business environment and future opportunities in Asia,” added IMD President Peter Lorange. “Over the last three decades, Joe Mueller has proven to be one of the most successful executives in mastering the dynamics of the Asian markets. His experience will play an important role as IMD focuses on the challenges and opportunities in emerging markets.”

Josef Müller (April 24, 1880 – September 21, 1964), also known as Giuseppe Müller, was a Croatian entomologist.
Life[edit]
Josef Müller was born in 1880 in Zadar, at the time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In school, he acquired solid knowledge of the classical languages, as well as of the scientific method.[1]
In 1898, he moved to Graz and studied natural history in the faculty of philosophy, concluding his studies in 1902. His dissertation was about the morphology of land planarians.[2] In 1900, he won the University of Graz's "Unger Prize" for a work on the anatomy of the roots of exotic orchids.[3] At this time he met many Austrian entomologists, such as Ludwig Ganglbauer.[1]
After his doctor examination, Müller moved to Trieste, where he started teaching natural history in Trieste High School and joined the Società Adriaca de Scienze Naturali. Later, he and other entomologists founded an entomology club and developed a comprehensive work program. This led him to study the arthropod fauna found in caves of the Trieste region, especially blind insects.[3] After presenting his results at the International Congress of Zoology in Graz, he became known in larger circles and started many scientific cooperations. One of his most notable works at the time was his monography on blind ground beetles, the "Monographie der blinden Trechen der Ostalpen und Balkanhalbinsel", for which he was awarded the Ganglbauer Prize.[1][3]
During World War I, his work was interrupted and he was drafted into the military service. There, his entomological knowledge proved to be valuable in the control of diseases transmitted by insects.[1] He spent his first year in an anti-malaria station in Albania and later was invited to the bacteriological laboratory in Vienna. In his study on the body louse, he proved that the bacteria Rickettsia prowazekii, known to cause epidemic typhus, is transmitted by the insect.[3]
In 1921, Müller became the conservator of the Natural History Museum in Trieste, and two years later became the director of the museum and of the botanical gardens. From 1930 to 1940, he traveled several times to North Africa to collect and study beetles of the family Histeridae. He also planned the construction of an aquarium in Trieste, which included many coral fish from Red Sea and that was opened in 1933.[3] He left the museum in 1946 due to his age.[3]
He died in Trieste in 1964, aged 84.[3]
Work[edit]
Most of Müller's work was focused on beetles, especially carabid beetles, and he described 757 new insect taxa, including many new genera. He also studied other animal groups, such as pseudoscorpions, crustaceans, reptiles and birds of prey.[3]
