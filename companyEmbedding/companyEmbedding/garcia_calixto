Calixto García in 1898


Calixto García Iñiguez (August 4, 1839 – December 11, 1898) was a general in three Cuban uprisings, part of the Cuban War for Independence: Ten Years' War, the Little War and the War of 1895, itself sometimes called the Cuban War for Independence, which bled into the Spanish–American War, ultimately resulting in national independence for Cuba.

Ancestry and progeny[edit]
García was born in Holguín to parents of Cuban Criollo descent. He was a large, strong, educated man with a short fuse. García was the grandson of Calixto García de Luna e Izquierdo, who had fought in the Battle of Carabobo in 1821 during Venezuelan War of Independence. His grandmother was Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez, said to be the daughter of a Cacique Chief from Valencia, Venezuela. His grandfather (who had dropped the aristocratic "de Luna" upon taking refuge in Cuba) had been jailed on March 18, 1837 for demanding emancipation of slaves, constitutional freedom for all, and allegedly trying to hang a priest who opposed him. As befitted a man of importance of that time, Calixto had a wife, Isabel Velez Cabrera, and a good number of mistresses; these women gave birth to many children both legitimate (about 7) and illegitimate (at least six, each to a different woman). A number of his sons, most notable Carlos García Velez[1][2] and Calixto Enamorado,[3] fought in his armies.
War record[edit]
Around the age of 18, taking after his grandfather, García joined with a Cuban uprising which became the first war of independence Ten Years' War. García fought against Spanish colonial rule for five years until his capture. Far from his troops, protected only by a small detail who soon lay dead or dying around him, Garcia in an attempt to avoid giving the Spanish the satisfaction of his seizure shot himself under the chin with a .45 caliber pistol. Although the bullet went out of his forehead and knocked him unconscious, he survived; the wound, which left a great scar, and gave him headaches for the rest of his life. When the Spanish authorities came to Holguín to inform Calixto's mother, Lucía Iñíguez, she said that he wasn't her son. When the officials explained to her Calixto tried to commit suicide, she replied that he was her son, "first dead than captured!" He was imprisoned until the Pact of Zanjón and the end of the Ten Years' War, was signed in 1878. García travelled to Paris and New York between imprisonments. In keeping to his quest, García joined with Maceo in the Little War from 1879 to 1880 as well as the 1895 War for Independence. He, and at least three sons, separately escaped Spain and arrived with a well-supplied expedition in 1896. In that last conflict he succeeded Maceo, once his subordinate in the Ten Years' War, as the second in command in the Cuban Army.

Garcia had a long string of victories in this war, which included the taking of Tunas and Guisa, and the emotionally significant re-occupation of Bayamo. García made liberal use of spies to prepare for his attacks. These include Dominador de la Guardia father of Ángel de la Guardia and María Machado, illegitimate daughter of Spanish General Emilio March who helped prepare the taking of Tunas; Frederick Funston later US Major General and José Martí y Zayas Bazán son of José Martí the major Cuban National Hero directed artillery; Mario García Menocal a to-be president of Cuba who was wounded in a principal assault. Angel de la Guardia, also a major Cuban national hero, died in this battle on August 30, 1897.[2]
At the time of the U.S. landings, García, with skilled use of mobile artillery, controlled the interior of old Oriente Province, and prepared the landing places for the U.S. Army near Santiago. His troops effectively supported the Marine forces at Guantanamo who, once out of range of the guns of the USS Marblehead, had difficulty dealing with Spanish guerrilla tactics. He was the general who dealt with the American troops and joined them in military actions, only to be denied entrance into Santiago de Cuba when the Spaniards surrendered.
Death[edit]
García died of pneumonia at age 59 on December 11, 1898, while on a diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. He was buried temporarily in Arlington National Cemetery in the U.S., then transported on the heavily armed seagoing war ship USS Nashville[4][5][6] to Cuba. His final burial in Cuba was preceded by a number of emotional incidents, and his statues and busts are found throughout Cuba. A major statue is found on the Malecon near the US Interests Section in Havana.[7] After his death, a large bronze tablet prominently inscribed with the phrase "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" was erected by the Masons at the place of his demise—the Raleigh Hotel in Washington, D.C. Today, this tablet resides at the private residence of one of Gen. García's direct descendants.

The essay "A Message to Garcia" by Elbert Hubbard was written in reference to U.S. intelligence officer Andrew Rowan's successful mission, against great odds, to establish contact with García early in the Spanish–American War. According to language expert Charles Earle Funk, "to take a message to Garcia", meaning to accept an extremely difficult challenge, was a popular U.S. slang expression for years. The essay was made into two American films, the 1916 silent A Message to Garcia with Garcia played by Charles Sutton and the 1936 film A Message to Garcia featuring Enrique Acosta.
In 1976 a municipality in Holguín Province was named Calixto Garcia for him. His portrait is on the 50 Cuban peso banknote.

Ancestry and progeny[edit]
García was born in Holguín to parents of Cuban Criollo descent. He was a large, strong, educated man with a short fuse. García was the grandson of Calixto García de Luna e Izquierdo, who had fought in the Battle of Carabobo in 1821 during Venezuelan War of Independence. His grandmother was Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez, said to be the daughter of a Cacique Chief from Valencia, Venezuela. His grandfather (who had dropped the aristocratic "de Luna" upon taking refuge in Cuba) had been jailed on March 18, 1837 for demanding emancipation of slaves, constitutional freedom for all, and allegedly trying to hang a priest who opposed him. As befitted a man of importance of that time, Calixto had a wife, Isabel Velez Cabrera, and a good number of mistresses; these women gave birth to many children both legitimate (about 7) and illegitimate (at least six, each to a different woman). A number of his sons, most notable Carlos García Velez[1][2] and Calixto Enamorado,[3] fought in his armies.
War record[edit]
Around the age of 18, taking after his grandfather, García joined with a Cuban uprising which became the first war of independence Ten Years' War. García fought against Spanish colonial rule for five years until his capture. Far from his troops, protected only by a small detail who soon lay dead or dying around him, Garcia in an attempt to avoid giving the Spanish the satisfaction of his seizure shot himself under the chin with a .45 caliber pistol. Although the bullet went out of his forehead and knocked him unconscious, he survived; the wound, which left a great scar, and gave him headaches for the rest of his life. When the Spanish authorities came to Holguín to inform Calixto's mother, Lucía Iñíguez, she said that he wasn't her son. When the officials explained to her Calixto tried to commit suicide, she replied that he was her son, "first dead than captured!" He was imprisoned until the Pact of Zanjón and the end of the Ten Years' War, was signed in 1878. García travelled to Paris and New York between imprisonments. In keeping to his quest, García joined with Maceo in the Little War from 1879 to 1880 as well as the 1895 War for Independence. He, and at least three sons, separately escaped Spain and arrived with a well-supplied expedition in 1896. In that last conflict he succeeded Maceo, once his subordinate in the Ten Years' War, as the second in command in the Cuban Army.

Garcia had a long string of victories in this war, which included the taking of Tunas and Guisa, and the emotionally significant re-occupation of Bayamo. García made liberal use of spies to prepare for his attacks. These include Dominador de la Guardia father of Ángel de la Guardia and María Machado, illegitimate daughter of Spanish General Emilio March who helped prepare the taking of Tunas; Frederick Funston later US Major General and José Martí y Zayas Bazán son of José Martí the major Cuban National Hero directed artillery; Mario García Menocal a to-be president of Cuba who was wounded in a principal assault. Angel de la Guardia, also a major Cuban national hero, died in this battle on August 30, 1897.[2]
At the time of the U.S. landings, García, with skilled use of mobile artillery, controlled the interior of old Oriente Province, and prepared the landing places for the U.S. Army near Santiago. His troops effectively supported the Marine forces at Guantanamo who, once out of range of the guns of the USS Marblehead, had difficulty dealing with Spanish guerrilla tactics. He was the general who dealt with the American troops and joined them in military actions, only to be denied entrance into Santiago de Cuba when the Spaniards surrendered.
Death[edit]
García died of pneumonia at age 59 on December 11, 1898, while on a diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. He was buried temporarily in Arlington National Cemetery in the U.S., then transported on the heavily armed seagoing war ship USS Nashville[4][5][6] to Cuba. His final burial in Cuba was preceded by a number of emotional incidents, and his statues and busts are found throughout Cuba. A major statue is found on the Malecon near the US Interests Section in Havana.[7] After his death, a large bronze tablet prominently inscribed with the phrase "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" was erected by the Masons at the place of his demise—the Raleigh Hotel in Washington, D.C. Today, this tablet resides at the private residence of one of Gen. García's direct descendants.

The essay "A Message to Garcia" by Elbert Hubbard was written in reference to U.S. intelligence officer Andrew Rowan's successful mission, against great odds, to establish contact with García early in the Spanish–American War. According to language expert Charles Earle Funk, "to take a message to Garcia", meaning to accept an extremely difficult challenge, was a popular U.S. slang expression for years. The essay was made into two American films, the 1916 silent A Message to Garcia with Garcia played by Charles Sutton and the 1936 film A Message to Garcia featuring Enrique Acosta.
In 1976 a municipality in Holguín Province was named Calixto Garcia for him. His portrait is on the 50 Cuban peso banknote.

Calixto García in 1898


Calixto García Iñiguez (August 4, 1839 – December 11, 1898) was a general in three Cuban uprisings, part of the Cuban War for Independence: Ten Years' War, the Little War and the War of 1895, itself sometimes called the Cuban War for Independence, which bled into the Spanish–American War, ultimately resulting in national independence for Cuba.

Ancestry and progeny[edit]
García was born in Holguín to parents of Cuban Criollo descent. He was a large, strong, educated man with a short fuse. García was the grandson of Calixto García de Luna e Izquierdo, who had fought in the Battle of Carabobo in 1821 during Venezuelan War of Independence. His grandmother was Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez, said to be the daughter of a Cacique Chief from Valencia, Venezuela. His grandfather (who had dropped the aristocratic "de Luna" upon taking refuge in Cuba) had been jailed on March 18, 1837 for demanding emancipation of slaves, constitutional freedom for all, and allegedly trying to hang a priest who opposed him. As befitted a man of importance of that time, Calixto had a wife, Isabel Velez Cabrera, and a good number of mistresses; these women gave birth to many children both legitimate (about 7) and illegitimate (at least six, each to a different woman). A number of his sons, most notable Carlos García Velez[1][2] and Calixto Enamorado,[3] fought in his armies.
War record[edit]
Around the age of 18, taking after his grandfather, García joined with a Cuban uprising which became the first war of independence Ten Years' War. García fought against Spanish colonial rule for five years until his capture. Far from his troops, protected only by a small detail who soon lay dead or dying around him, Garcia in an attempt to avoid giving the Spanish the satisfaction of his seizure shot himself under the chin with a .45 caliber pistol. Although the bullet went out of his forehead and knocked him unconscious, he survived; the wound, which left a great scar, and gave him headaches for the rest of his life. When the Spanish authorities came to Holguín to inform Calixto's mother, Lucía Iñíguez, she said that he wasn't her son. When the officials explained to her Calixto tried to commit suicide, she replied that he was her son, "first dead than captured!" He was imprisoned until the Pact of Zanjón and the end of the Ten Years' War, was signed in 1878. García travelled to Paris and New York between imprisonments. In keeping to his quest, García joined with Maceo in the Little War from 1879 to 1880 as well as the 1895 War for Independence. He, and at least three sons, separately escaped Spain and arrived with a well-supplied expedition in 1896. In that last conflict he succeeded Maceo, once his subordinate in the Ten Years' War, as the second in command in the Cuban Army.

A Biography of


Major General Calixto Ramón García
Iñiguez
Contributed by Larry Daley

Click here to read Maj.
Gen. Garcia's Official Report of the War in Cuba
General:
This is a brief biography of the life of Cuban Major General Calixto
Ramón García Iñiguez.
Introduction:
General
Garcias struggles against Spanish tyranny lasted from 1868 to 1898. 
When he died General Garcia was first buried in Arlington National Cemetery
with full U.S. military honors.  Archbishop Ireland spoke highly of
him in his funeral mass.  The Masons erected a bronze tablet where
he died at the Raleigh Hotel in Washington.  The Cuban general was
very large, strong, educated, hot tempered man but always logical in battle
he is known as the strategist.  He was descended from a well known
Spanish family with a warrior tradition.  His grandfather Calixto
Garcia de Luna e Izquierdo, had fought with the Spanish in the critical
Battle of Carabobo in what is now Venezuela (1821) and losing one hand
was one of a small number of Spanish survivors.  His grandfather,
who dropped the aristocratic de Luna part when he took refuge in Cuba,
was jailed for demanding emancipation for the slaves, constitutional freedom
for all, and it is reported trying to hang a priest who opposed this, on
March 18, 1837.
.There is a semi-mythical report that General Calixto Garcia Iñiguez
was descended from King Calixto Garcia-Iñiguez through his mother
Lucia Iñiguez Landon.  This king was the son of Iñigo
Arista (and hence Iñiguez) founder of the Arista (named from the
oak and meaning strong in battle) dynasty of Pamplona.  King Calixto
Garcia Iñiguez is recorded as captured and ransomed by the Vikings
in 852. There is no complete English language biography of General Calixto
Garcia.  Even the books in Spanish cited in the biography only tell
selected parts of his life and long military career.  A summary (some
corrections from sources cited at end of article are included within brackets)
of the generals  life is found in his obituary in Harpers Weekly
(December 24, 1898 p. 1263):
Destiny, as we all know, is a sarcastic creature, and it happens
often that folks die just when it seems to observers that they have got
ready to live. It was certainly so with General Calixto Garcia, who died
of pneumonia, in Washington, on December 11 (1898).  It is only a
few weeks since he came from Cuba at the head of the special Cuban commission
which was empowered to communicate the views of the Cuban leaders to our
government.
General Garcia was fifty-eight (59) years old, and for more than
half his life his chief concern had been the overthrow of Spanish rule
in Cuba.  He was born in Holguin, in 1840 (August 4, 1839), and was
one of the instigators of the Cuban rebellion of 1868.  For five years
he was active and successful in fights and forays against the Spaniards,
but in September 1873 (September 6, 1974) he was surprised with twenty
(16) men by 500 (sic).  Seeing that there was no chance to get away,
and unwilling to be captured alive, he put the muzzle of his (0.45 caliber)
pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger.  The ball, instead of
going through his brain, came out of his forehead between his eyes, and
he recovered.  He was sent to Spain and held prisoner until the peace
of Zanjon was signed in 1877 (1878).  Then he went to Paris, and hence
to New York and back to Cuba, and presently took part with Maceo in what
was called the little war (1879-1880).  Captured again, his life
was spared, and he was sent back to Spain, where he lived for seventeen
(15) years under police supervision in Madrid.  There he supported
his family, which grew large, by teaching.
When the last revolution broke, out in 1894, he grew restless again,
and finally slipped away from Madrid and reached New York in November,
1895.  He commanded the Hawkings filbustering expedition which came
to grief, but after two more unsuccessful attempt reached Cuba in March
1896.  His record as Cuban leader after that is a matter of general
knowledge.  His cooperation with the American Forces in the Capture
of Santiago fairly brought him in at the death of the Spanish rule that
he fought so long.
Of the three Cuban generals of greatest note in the last revolution
(Antonio Maceo and Máximo Gómez)
only Gomez now survives.

A Biography of


Major General Calixto Ramón García
Iñiguez
Contributed by Larry Daley

Click here to read Maj.
Gen. Garcia's Official Report of the War in Cuba
General:
This is a brief biography of the life of Cuban Major General Calixto
Ramón García Iñiguez.
Introduction:
General
Garcias struggles against Spanish tyranny lasted from 1868 to 1898. 
When he died General Garcia was first buried in Arlington National Cemetery
with full U.S. military honors.  Archbishop Ireland spoke highly of
him in his funeral mass.  The Masons erected a bronze tablet where
he died at the Raleigh Hotel in Washington.  The Cuban general was
very large, strong, educated, hot tempered man but always logical in battle
he is known as the strategist.  He was descended from a well known
Spanish family with a warrior tradition.  His grandfather Calixto
Garcia de Luna e Izquierdo, had fought with the Spanish in the critical
Battle of Carabobo in what is now Venezuela (1821) and losing one hand
was one of a small number of Spanish survivors.  His grandfather,
who dropped the aristocratic de Luna part when he took refuge in Cuba,
was jailed for demanding emancipation for the slaves, constitutional freedom
for all, and it is reported trying to hang a priest who opposed this, on
March 18, 1837.
.There is a semi-mythical report that General Calixto Garcia Iñiguez
was descended from King Calixto Garcia-Iñiguez through his mother
Lucia Iñiguez Landon.  This king was the son of Iñigo
Arista (and hence Iñiguez) founder of the Arista (named from the
oak and meaning strong in battle) dynasty of Pamplona.  King Calixto
Garcia Iñiguez is recorded as captured and ransomed by the Vikings
in 852. There is no complete English language biography of General Calixto
Garcia.  Even the books in Spanish cited in the biography only tell
selected parts of his life and long military career.  A summary (some
corrections from sources cited at end of article are included within brackets)
of the generals  life is found in his obituary in Harpers Weekly
(December 24, 1898 p. 1263):
Destiny, as we all know, is a sarcastic creature, and it happens
often that folks die just when it seems to observers that they have got
ready to live. It was certainly so with General Calixto Garcia, who died
of pneumonia, in Washington, on December 11 (1898).  It is only a
few weeks since he came from Cuba at the head of the special Cuban commission
which was empowered to communicate the views of the Cuban leaders to our
government.
General Garcia was fifty-eight (59) years old, and for more than
half his life his chief concern had been the overthrow of Spanish rule
in Cuba.  He was born in Holguin, in 1840 (August 4, 1839), and was
one of the instigators of the Cuban rebellion of 1868.  For five years
he was active and successful in fights and forays against the Spaniards,
but in September 1873 (September 6, 1974) he was surprised with twenty
(16) men by 500 (sic).  Seeing that there was no chance to get away,
and unwilling to be captured alive, he put the muzzle of his (0.45 caliber)
pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger.  The ball, instead of
going through his brain, came out of his forehead between his eyes, and
he recovered.  He was sent to Spain and held prisoner until the peace
of Zanjon was signed in 1877 (1878).  Then he went to Paris, and hence
to New York and back to Cuba, and presently took part with Maceo in what
was called the little war (1879-1880).  Captured again, his life
was spared, and he was sent back to Spain, where he lived for seventeen
(15) years under police supervision in Madrid.  There he supported
his family, which grew large, by teaching.
When the last revolution broke, out in 1894, he grew restless again,
and finally slipped away from Madrid and reached New York in November,
1895.  He commanded the Hawkings filbustering expedition which came
to grief, but after two more unsuccessful attempt reached Cuba in March
1896.  His record as Cuban leader after that is a matter of general
knowledge.  His cooperation with the American Forces in the Capture
of Santiago fairly brought him in at the death of the Spanish rule that
he fought so long.
Of the three Cuban generals of greatest note in the last revolution
(Antonio Maceo and Máximo Gómez)
only Gomez now survives.
