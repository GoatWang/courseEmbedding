History











Client Focused for More Than 45 Years For more than four decades, Manning & Napier has been guiding individual and institutional clients toward their financial goals. Our independent, opportunistic style can help you meet a wide variety of investment needs even in the most challenging environments. We’re majority employee-owned, which means we’re able to give you the kind of service and commitment that only comes from people who have a direct stake in your success. Manning & Napier was founded in April of 1970 by Bill Manning and Bill Napier. To survive and grow in a difficult economic time, we had to add real value for our clients. As of  we manage  billion in assets for individuals, corporate benefit plans, union pension and annuity funds, endowments, foundations, profit sharing plans, and 401(k) plans. Headquartered just outside of Rochester, NY, we have additional offices in Columbus, OH, and St. Petersburg, FL to service clients nationwide. 














The Manning Rule











The Manning Rule
Our cofounder, Bill Manning, has long been an advocate for investor protection. He actively campaigned to abolish the long-standing practice of "dealer-first," whereby a broker/dealer buys or sells shares ahead of, and sometimes in direct conflict with, the interests of a client. He saw the practice as fraudulent and detrimental to investors.
The 1994 decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ban NASDAQ brokers from trading ahead of customer-limit orders had its roots in a court case begun by Mr. Manning in 1984. Since that decision, "Manning Rule" notices have been distributed to millions of securities holders and are now included in most new account literature.
