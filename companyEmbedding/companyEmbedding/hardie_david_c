ColorPlus® Technology

Make your house the talk of the block with color. For lasting color, only James Hardie’s exclusive ColorPlus® Technology provides color you can count on.








The Quest for
Perfect Color


All James Hardie® siding and trim products are available primed and ready for field painting. But when you invest in ColorPlus® Technology, you won’t only get gorgeous color—you’ll get color that lasts longer than a typical paint job.



 Download Product Catalog







1 Durable
Finish

We apply multiple coats (50 percent more than your average house painter uses) of our proprietary finish to every surface and edge of our siding and trim, leaving no spot uncovered.



2 Baked-On Bond

Between coats, we cure the finish in a controlled environment for an even stronger bond that resists chipping, peeling and cracking.



3 UV-Ray Resistance

Vinyl siding and paint both fade in the sun. ColorPlus® Technology resists fading and looks good for longer.



Hardie retains the look of wood and also with the ColorPlus®, it’s all one uniform color. It’s just a much more attractive look.
TERRY STAMMAN is the owner of Twin Cities Siding Professionals and recommends James Hardie products over wood-based alternatives.

Fade Resistance










Curated Color Palette


                          Choosing from thousands of paint swatches is daunting to say the least. So we’ve narrowed the options for you. Our color experts have created a stunning selection of colors that we know look great on exterior siding—so you can stop second-guessing yourself.

Live Colorfully...
                        








Consistent Application


                          Why ColorPlus® Techology and not regular paint?  Because our finish was developed especially for James Hardie fiber cement siding and we apply multiple coats, with each layer baked on in a closely controlled factory environment to ensure consistent coverage.
                        








Fade Resistance


                          Paint and other siding finishes applied in the field can dull substantially over time. ColorPlus® Technology is specifically engineered to help resist damaging UV rays, so your color will stay vibrant for longer.
                        







                The Colorplus® Technology Warranty
              

                ColorPlus® Technology finish comes with a 15-year limited warranty that covers paint and labor, protecting against peeling, cracking, and chipping.

We combine innovation and artistry to help you have the home of your dreams.

Larry H.
Tacoma WA

We were happy with the work.




Bill D.
Auburn WA

Excellent crews to work with




Ron H.
Sumner WA

I had Coddington re-side the south side of my house and replace the kitchen door.  The entire staff was courteous and professional.  The price was probably higher than Bubba down the street, but it was done right, on time, and on budget.




Beverly M.
Seattle WA

They were very professional and kind. When the weather permitted, they got their work done.




Terry W.
Auburn WA

They did great work at a great price. They did what they said they were going to do and we're very happy with the quality of materials and workmanship.

(copied from my angie's list review)scope of work:Remove existing vinyl and original wood siding from a 1924 home.Install new wood windows (Marvin Ultimate Clad)Install new Hardie siding (lap + shingle)Install new soffit woodwork (beaded pine)Insulate attic and walls from exterior under sidingRepair minor breaches and issues with garage and trim woodPaint garage (without residing it) and all exterior trim, and window interiorAdd gutters and rain chains to front porchreview:Overall, the job went extremely well, and I highly recommend Coddington Construction.I was fortunate to have Ken, the owner, provide the initial consultation and bid. He was very patient, and helped me understand all the details and considerations. After having met with about 7 different contractors, Ken won my business, hands-down, with his helpfulness and professionalism. Even when we ran into a few (very) minor challenges during the project, Ken was friendly and patient.I'd read in the reviews that people were very happy with Mark and Michelle's team, so I asked if I could have them do the job. And they were also great. Very friendly, respectful, and took into account every detail of the work that was planned, and made adjustments as necessary. It was a pleasure saying hello to Mark, Michelle, Brandon, and Noah each day, and we actually kind of missed them when the job was done!The original consultation was April 28.Deposit was made on May 6 to commit to the work.We had some waiting time due to:* ordering the Color Plus Hardie material, * I decided to go with a higher end window (totally worth it!!!) which needed to be special ordered,* aligning with the team's schedule of projectsOriginal estimate was that work may begin 2nd week of June, but the above resulted in us starting work end of June. This was not a problem for us. The project was estimated to take 2 weeks to complete (plus additional few days for painters). In reality, it was about ~3.5 weeks to complete construction, but we had a delay after the first 3 weeks, due to running out of some of the siding material and they needed to come back for a few days. This ended up moving us back about 3-4 weeks while waiting for material and possibly for the team to have a break between jobs again, with the team completing the final bit of construction middle of August. The painters came maybe a couple of weeks later to do the trim.We then needed to wait one last time, due to schedule alignment for the teams, to get the interior of the windows painted (I think that most people are ordering vinyl or fiberglass windows these days, I can actually empathize that it must have been a big pain to need to come and paint wood windows).The project did take longer than anticipated from start-to-finish, but I am realistic enough to know that ideal timelines are rarely achievable due to practicalities. Ken never left us in a situation where our home was in any kind of disarray. The team cleaned up the entire site every day, so that there was not an accumulation of debris. And when they were finished, it was spotless. They got the windows installed quickly, and took great care to make sure the home was well sealed from the elements during that process. And when we did have the delay, it was at a point in the project where the impact on us was basically zero.Most importantly, the quality of this work was extremely high. The workers and the business were conscientious. Ken was very accommodating in coordinating details. And communications were timely.If I had it to do over again, I would make the exact same choice that I made.




Donald C.
Kent WA

Coddington Construction did an excellent job on replacing the siding on our house.  It looks better now than it did when it was brand new!




Richard S.
Tacoma WA

This was a major investment for us and we could not be happier with the results.  I would recommend this company very highly.




Steve B.
Renton WA

Mark, Michelle and Noah were an outstanding team. Courteous, always made sure they were doing what we wanted (we didn't have a straightforward house to reside), great craftsmanship and always left the outside in great shape at the end of each work day.




Bill C.
Seattle WA

Very professional, excellent work, fair price. This kind of work (new siding, painting) is frequently delayed by the weather, but they stayed on task until the job was done.




James T.
Tacoma WA

During the entire project, Coddington Construction provided superior quality workmanship and staff that helped us make home improvements.  Always courteous, when we would come home from work, our house and yard would be cleaned up daily from the project, and we never felt that we were living and hindered in a construction zone. You could tell from the moment the crew arrived and the way they conducted themselves that we never had to worry being given low grade, low quality craftsmanship.  The house now looks awesome and is very curb appealing.




David C.
Redmond WA

Coddington did an excellent job all around of getting our project completed as we liked.




Chris P.
Seattle WA

Our house had two layers of siding on it (the top layer being yellow vinyl siding).  Visually the siding detracted from the overall look of the house.  Ken and the team did a great job making recommendations that really enhanced the overall look of our new siding.  They suggested adding some decorative shingles and narrowing the reveal of the siding that really made the house look great.  Our neighbors comment on how great the house looks all the time.




Trudy W.
Renton WA

They worked quickly and neatly without sacrificing the quality!  The crew acted like they were working on their own house with great attention to detail, precise workmanship, cleaning up all construction debris daily.  The crew was friendly and eager to respond to all of my questions and requests.  The painters were also efficient and did a precise job.  I couldn't be happier with the results.  I feel like I'm living in a brand new house!




John D.
Bellevue WA

Quality. Quality.  Quality.  The best construction experience I've ever had, starting with the professionalism of the construction team to the finished product. The workmanship and professionalism was outstanding. It was pretty complicated because we had our house completely resided, many windows replaced, new garage doors, new front door installed with trim, some skylights replaced, gutters installed and had the whole house repainted.  The results are stellar.




David P.
Des Moines WA

Working with Ken and his team was great.  They always responded quickly to my questions and any concerns.   The end result looks great and is exactly what I had envisioned.   They were always reliable and timely.




Gary H.
Auburn WA

Coddington Construction prepared a fair bid for new siding on my house.  The crew did a good job and cleaned up as they went.  One corner on the house did not look as good as the others, but it was fixed right away after I pointed it out to the company owner on the final walk-thru.
