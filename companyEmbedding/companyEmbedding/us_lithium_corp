U.S. Lithium Corp To Revitalize IWeedz Marijuana Platform






GlobeNewswire



Nov 29, 2016 8:30 AM EST













 




























































 HENDERSON, Nev., Nov. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Lithium Corp. (OTC:LITH) (the "Company") is pleased to announce the highly anticipated relaunching of the iWeedz platform. The Company had spent several years building the most advanced and most comprehensive delivery platform for the U.S. and Canada and now with the favorable new legislations around North America we believe we are well ahead of any other platform and the proof is by the large interest we are receiving.  The iWeedz.com search engine is a cannabis information resource that connects consumers with vendors or likeminded individuals. iWeedz streamlines the process of finding the right strains and products for your ailments comfortably, fast and simple. Whether you're new to cannabis, a medical marijuana patient, or simply a recreational consumer, iWeedz is the perfect destination. iWeedz.com for vendors will be a cloud based solution to manage inventory, post daily deals, attract new customer with proximity marketing via mobile phones, engage with customers via email and text messaging and offer payment processing. The Company will operate its technology platform through its soon relaunched Website located at www.iWeedz.com, and through its mobile application for Apple iPhone operating system (iOS) and Android operating systems. The move to revitalize the iWeedz platform comes at a time when Shoppers Drug Mart, Canada's largest pharmacy chain, has formally applied to be a distributor of medical marijuana. With more than 1,200 locations across Canada including Pharmaprix in Quebec, Shoppers is the largest pharmacy chain in the country. According to the latest government data, just in Canada alone more than 75,000 Canadians had valid prescriptions for medical marijuana at the end of June — a figure that has tripled in the past year — and they had purchased a total of more than 4,000 kilograms of dried marijuana in the previous three months. That works out to a little less than a gram of pot per day, per person. Furthermore, in recent elections numerous states in the United States, including California, have approved to legalized marijuana.

Airush


In The Beginning
…and we’re talking right at the very beginning, around 1997, when a French windsurfing speed sailor called Manu Bertin brought a few samples of an early Wipika inflatable kite to Maui. Manu was sure that there was a sport about to explode, but he had issues with the kite’s lack of basic accessories.
Manu was sponsored for his windsurfing booms by a brand called Hawaiian Pro Line, a Maui based outfit that specialised in the development of custom and production built windsurfing booms, run by Keith and Karen Baxter. Manu approached Keith explaining his basic accessory needs; and it’s with them that this Airush journey really begins.

Airush Kiteboards



In The Beginning
…and we’re talking right at the very beginning, right around 1997, when a French windsurfing speed sailor named Manu Bertin brought a few samples of an early Wipika inflatable kite to Maui. Manu was sure that there was a sport about to explode, but he had issues with the kite’s lack of basic accessories.
Manu was sponsored for his windsurfing booms by a brand called Hawaiian Pro Line, a Maui based outfit that specialised in the development of custom and production built windsurfing booms, run by Keith and Karen Baxter. Manu approached Keith explaining his basic accessory needs; and it’s with them that this Airush journey really begins.

Holiday Deal of the Week


2016/17 Airush DNA SE 12M Kite Complete - $899







The Airush DNA is a great kite for almost anyone. It has smooth power, vast wind range, relaunches easily, and turns quickly making it perfect for ripping waves, huge sent jumps, and cruising around your local spot. Compared to other kites in the freeride category it has moderate bar pressure that gives you great feel without fatigue.
Extra bonus... We liked this kite so much that we special ordered some from the factory with a one pump system to maximize setup speed and simplicity. That means more time on the water.
This package includes the DNA SE 12M, Progression Bar, and Pump.

Product Description

2017 Airush Lithium Kiteboarding Kite

What Airush has to say about the 2017 Lithium

THE WORLD’S FAVORITE FREERIDE KITE
INCREDIBLY STABLE WITH SMOOTH CONSISTENT DRIVE
FAST AND SIMPLE TO RELAUNCH DUE TO THE DELTA HYBRID DESIGN

As the do-all kite in the Airush range, the Lithium has been proven to meet the requirements of riders looking to do a bit of everything: freeride, jumping, looping and waves. With amazing park power, stability, and ease of use, the Lithium is simply the perfect kite. The focus of wingtip and strut layout in conjunction with the Delta Hybrid design ensures the quickest response through the air as well as instant relaunch. The square wingtip with increased area improves unhooked and overall performance without sacrificing the legendary relaunch, stability or wind range.
The Lithium 17m features the same Lithium freeride flying characteristics but optimized for extremely light wind. Reinforcement has been minimized to save weight and optimized for the unique loads in lighter winds. This optimization compensates for the weight of the additional struts, increasing the stability when the wind picks up, and working in conjunction with the load frame to increase the longevity of the canopy.
Video Overview

Technology
Next Gen Dyneema Load Frame
The Airush load frame comprises a unique web of Dyneema that supports the primary loading off the canopy. These sections of low stretch, ultra-light Dyneema Yarn are designed to be subjected to individual loads well beyond that of the canopy cloth
Technoforce D2
This premium fabric is used in conjunction with the Dyneema Load Frame for the ultimate combination of durability and performance. Ongoing testing has highlighted the lowest stretch and UV stability, along with the highest long-term reliability of any fabric available.
V3 Bridle
The V3 Bridle System contributes significantly to the turning speed and performance of supported leading edge kites.  In addition, the total de-power adds immensely to the safety benefits. The positioning of the bridle attachment points on the LE of the kite, combined with the V pulleys, give a range of movement. The result is steering that is light , but direct enough to feel where your kite is while riding. The key benefit of the V3 bridle is that the kite maintains steering even when completely de-powered. This increase the usable wind range and overall performance significantly.
Bar Pressure Adjustment
All Airush bridled kites feature the bar pressure adjustments on the leading edge of the kite. These options allowed the rider to select the perfect amount of feedback and comfort in the bar while riding with simple and quick adjustments before your session.
Airush Bumpers
Airush bumpers are found throughout the leading edge of the kites to reduce wear and increase durability on rough surfaces. These bumpers are key for increasing the lifespan of Airush kites.

2017 Airush Control Bar Options

2017 Airush Progression Control Bar
The Airush Progression Bar gives riders the opportunity to have industry standard safety and strength without the added features and adjustability of the Airush Core Bar. The Progression Bar includes the 45-52cm adjustable bar ends, which allows it to be used on any Airush 4 line kite from 4-14 meters. Together with 24m flying lines (with 10m and 14m extensions), the Progression Bar complies with IKO and BKSA teaching standards with quick and easy line changes, as well as single-line flag out safety.
 
2017 Airush Core Control Bar 
The most versatile bar on the market enables riders to have the perfect setup straight out of the bag, or to tweak and modify the bar to suit their specific requirements. The Core Bar features a new directional grooving pattern that helps you hang on through all conditions with maximum grip and comfort.
Developed as the first ever bar that has four length adjustments, the Core bar can be changed from 45-55cm or 52-62xm with simple and easy changes. This allows the bar to be used from our absolutely smallest kite to the largest kite in the Airush range.

  U.S. LITHIUM CORP About U.S. Lithium Corporation U.S. Lithium Corporation is an exploration and development company focused in North America on lithium and related resources for the rapidly growing energy storage industry. The Company looks to capitalize on opportunities within the lithium sector including providing lithium to the ever expanding next generation battery market. Lithium demand is projected to triple by the year 2025 according to a recent report by Goldman Sachs and for many analysts is considered the new gasoline of the future. As the demand for lithium expands, U.S. Lithium Corp intends to be an integral part of this next booming industry. Our current focus is in the Basin and Range province of Nevada where the only producing lithium brine mine in North America, Albemarle’s Silver Peak Project, is located.

This note matures in one year from issuance.    Current Business    iWeedz.com     On November 29, 2016 we issued a news release announcing our intention to relaunch our proprietary iWeedz.com search engine and e-commerce platform which was originally launched in February 2014.  The iWeedz.com search engine is a cannabis information resource that connects consumers with vendors or likeminded individuals. iWeedz.com for vendors will be a cloud based solution to manage inventory, post daily deals, attract new customer with proximity marketing via mobile phones, engage with customers via email & text messaging and offer payment processing. We intend to operate this technology platform through a relaunched Website located at www.iWeedz.com, and through mobile application for Apple iPhone operating system (iOS) and Android operating systems. As of the date of this report, our website is not fully functional and our application for Apple iOS and Android operating systems has not been released.   Our decision to revitalize the iWeedz platform comes at a time when several U.S. States have legalized and regulated, or are in the process of legalizing and regulating, medical marijuana.  The states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have also legalized marijuana for recreational use.  Additionally, the Government of Canada has been engaged in an ongoing process of regulating medical marijuana, and is expected to introduce legislation for the legalization of recreational marijuana in the spring of 2017.   iWeedz will generate revenue by charging member cannabis vendors a monthly fee and by selling banner space on its website and application to these vendors. The banners will be viewable by iWeedz consumer members who are within the vendor’s geographic location and who indicate an interest in the vendor or its products, based on the member’s profile or specific user information gathered by the iWeedz technology.  We believe iWeedz’s targeted market intelligence will allow us to charge a premium for ad space. As of the date of this report, we have not yet determined the cost to our vendors for banner space.   Target Market   Our target market includes both businesses and consumers in the local marijuana industry. iWeedz is intended for all types of cannabis consumers including those new to cannabis, medical marijuana patients, or recreational consumers, if recreational use is legally permitted in the consumer’s state of residence. iWeedz also targets both medicinal and recreational dispensaries, depending on whether the specific geographical location legally permits recreational marijuana use.   Our target market further includes consumers who are frequent users of the internet, mobile phones and other mobile devices to locate retailers, conduct online research and act on promotions such as daily deals, coupons or discounts.   Our Mineral Exploration Business    Our mineral exploration strategy is focused on the acquisition, and development of Cobalt, nickel, and lithium resources properties to capitalize on the growing energy storage (battery) market associated with the popularization of electric vehicles.     On February 24, 2017, we entered into an Option/Purchase Agreement dated February 23, 2017 (the “Agreement”) with Diamond Hunter Ltd. (the “Optionor”) pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive option to purchase a 100% interest in the Gochagar Lake Nickel-Copper-Cobalt project claims.  The project consists of four claims covering 3,759 hectares, is located in northern Saskatchewan approximately 75 km north of the town of La Ronge.  13    In consideration of the option, the Company will issue 8,000,000 shares of its common stock to the principals of the Optionor. To complete the acquisition, the Company must incur expenditures of not less than USD$50,000 on or before June 1, 2017, and not less than USD$225,000 on or before July 12, 2018. Thereafter the claims will be subject to a royalty equal to two percent (2%) Net Smelter Return (NSR) for as long as the Company holds any interest in the claims, subject to a right to repurchase a 1% NSR for $1,250,000 at any time up to when a production decision is made.     The Gochagar Lake Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Project     The  Gochagar Lake  project, consists of four claims covering 3,759 hectares and is located in northern Saskatchewan approximately 75 km north of the town of La Ronge.  The claims include the following tenures:        Tenure No.       Hectares       Expiry/Renewal Date                           S-110897       229       9/12/2018     S-110898       2,702       9/12/2018     S-110899       591       9/12/2018     S-110665       167       5/16/2019        Historical exploration has identified semi-massive and massive Ni-Cu deposits with significantly elevated levels of Cobalt, a vital component in the manufacture of the latest generation of lithium ion batteries.  The terms “semi-massive” and “massive” do not refer to size, but rather refer to mineral deposits associated with or created by the warming of subsurface water by volcanic events.    Background and Technical Summary   Nickel-copper-cobalt sulphide mineralization was discovered at Gochagar Lake, located in the La Ronge meta-volcanic belt, in the mid-1960s with subsequent exploration carried out mainly by the Scurry-Rainbow Oil Company Limited.  Exploration activities included soil sampling, trenching of gossans, geophysical surveys and diamond drilling.  A total of 85 mostly vertical drill holes (total of 27,400 m) delineated the mineralized Gochagar A-Zone (or Main Zone) with a strike length of 330 meters, widths of up to 120 meters, and depths of up to 305 meters. The Gochagar A-Zone mineralization consists of disseminated mm-cm size blebs of sulphide, net-textured sulphide and, in places, semi-massive to massive sulphide pods. Assay grades of up to 3.1% Ni, 0.28% Cu, and 0.22% Co were reported.  Saskatchewan government records (Mineral Property # 0880) reported assay values as high as 3.92%Ni, 0.70% Cu and 2.86% Co.   Examination of the available geological and geophysical data, plus first-hand experience on the property by a senior Ni-Cu-PGE consultant, indicates the property has some very positive exploration attributes not previously recognized.  These include:         1.  The semi-massive and massive sulphide concentrations in the Gochagar mineralized zone have high Ni/Cu ratios (>10), and Pd/Ir ratios (6-11). Since 1980, it has been speculated that komatiitic nickel sulphide mineralization and potential ores should exist in the central La Ronge meta-volcanic belt because of the recognition of komatiite lavas in the belt.              2.  Research has clearly demonstrated that the komatiitic composition of the massive sulphides in the Gochagar Lake deposit are not compatible with the host rock and rock forming mineral compositions that the sulphides reside in. This suggests that these high grade Ni-Cu-Co sulphides were introduced through an interconnected mineralized plumbing system that was tapping into a much more primitive mineralized komatiitic system at depth or proximal to the main deposit.  This is further corroborated by discoveries in the Gochagar Lake area of discrete high grade massive Ni-Cu-Co sulphides in the surrounding country rock.  These sulphides are devoid of any mafic or ultramafic rock material like that hosting the Gochagar Lake deposit.         14               3.  The Gochagar Lake area and deposit sit on the boundary between the Rottenstone Domain and the La Ronge Domain. It is well known that structural boundaries between two major geological terranes are an excellent geological environment for the formation of Ni-Cu deposits.              4.  The area is extensively covered with glacial debris and muskeg, so surface geological prospecting should not reveal any new gossans or outcrop showings, as was the case in the early exploration of the 1960’s. However, a 2,284 km deep penetrating state of the art airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey (VTEM) was flown in June 2008 and identified numerous potential targets that have yet to be investigated.         Exploration Plan    US Lithium’s initial work plan will involve a digital compilation of all available data into a comprehensive data base, reprocessing of all geophysical data and a complete reinterpretation of the geology.  A new 3-D model will be generated which will allow the Company to better visualize the deposit’s potential size and geometry and prepare its Phase 2 drilling plan.   Elon Claims, Esmeralda County Nevada    On April 25, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Rangefront whereby Rangefront granted us the option to acquire 100% of the title, interest and right in and to four mineral claims, known as the Elon claims, located in Esmerelda County, NevadaIn exchange for the grant of the Option by Rangefront, we paid $3,500 to Rangefront on signing of the agreement and issued an aggregate of 200,000 restricted common shares of our company to Brian Goss as the authorized representative of Rangefront.    The Elon claim block consists of four 20-acre placer claims and is located in Esmerelda County, Nevada. Clayton Valley is home to the only mine producing lithium from brine in North America. As at the date of this report, we have not conducted any exploration on the Elon Claims. On August 25, 2016, we renewed the Elon claims until September 1, 2017. We plan to maintain the claims for the foreseeable future but have no plans to conduct exploration on the property during fiscal 2017.   Competition   The mining industry is intensely competitive. We aim to compete with numerous individuals and companies, including many major mining companies, which have substantially greater technical, financial and operational resources and staffs. Accordingly, there is a high degree of competition for access to investment funds to support acquisition, exploration and development. There are other competitors that have operations in the areas in which our properties are located, and the presence of these competitors could adversely affect our ability to compete for financing and obtain the service providers, staff or equipment necessary for the exploration and exploitation of our properties.   Compliance with Government Regulation   Regulation related to iWeedz.com   We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet or other online services. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, subscriber privacy, anti-spam, data protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. In addition, it is possible that government entities or public interest groups may seek to censor content available on our website and application or may even attempt to completely block our emails or access to our websites. Adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business. In particular, in the event that we are restricted, in whole or in part, from operating in certain locations, our ability to increase our customer base may be adversely affected. Currently, we believe we are in compliance with such government regulations and laws.     15       Additionally, a variety of federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. In addition, various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. For example, recently there have been Congressional hearings and increased attention to the capture and use of location-based information relating to users of smartphones and other mobile devices. We intend to post privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of member data on our website and application. Several Internet companies have incurred substantial penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices. In addition, several states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles, could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of consumer members or vendors and adversely affect our business. Federal and state governmental authorities also continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third party web “cookies” for behavioral advertising. The regulation of these “cookies” and other current online advertising practices could adversely affect our business.   Marijuana Regulation   At least 24 States in the USA, and the federal government of Canada have passed some form of legislation related to the permission to grow, cultivate, sell or use marijuana either for medical purposes or for recreational or “adult use” purposes; or both. The various state legislation is not necessarily harmonious with one another, leading to potential conflicts between state laws. It is most often not legal to transport cannabis-related products across state lines and national borders.   We do not intend to directly hold, handle, or distribute any marijuana products in any location within or outside of the USA. We intend to comply with federal law that provides for certain exemptions for agricultural (industrial) hemp and certain byproducts to be manufactured and sold in the US. Our technology may have applications within the legal marijuana sector and we may seek to license that technology to companies that have met and comply with state regulations for the sale or distribution of cannabis related products in any particular jurisdiction.   Mineral Exploration    Any operations at our mineral exploration properties will be subject to various federal, state, or provincial laws and regulations in the US or Canada which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We will be required to obtain those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct exploration and other programs. There are no current orders or directions relating to us or to our lithium properties with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. Such compliance may include feasibility studies on the surface impact of our proposed operations, costs associated with minimizing surface impact, water treatment and protection, reclamation activities, including rehabilitation of various sites, on-going efforts at alleviating the mining impact on wildlife and permits or bonds as may be required to ensure our compliance with applicable regulations. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with such compliance could become so prohibitive that we may decide to not proceed with exploration, development, or mining operations on any of our mineral properties. We are not presently aware of any specific material environmental constraints affecting our properties that would preclude the economic development or operation of our optioned property.  16    Environmental Regulations    We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements.   While our intended projects and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   Research and Development   We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.   Intellectual Property   Our company acquired an exclusive license to use certain patents, technical information and trademarks for a term of 500 years, pursuant to the license agreement with Windward dated March 12, 2014, including the domain names www.iWeeds.com, www.iWeedz.com and the platform that powers iWeeds.com.

U.S. Lithium Corp to Revitalize iWeedz Marijuana Platform




















November 29, 2016 08:30 ET

 | Source: U.S. Lithium Corp.






HENDERSON, Nev., Nov.  29, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Lithium Corp. (OTC:LITH) (the "Company") is pleased to announce the highly anticipated relaunching of the iWeedz platform. The Company had spent several years building the most advanced and most comprehensive delivery platform for the U.S. and Canada and now with the favorable new legislations around North America we believe we are well ahead of any other platform and the proof is by the large interest we are receiving.  The iWeedz.com search engine is a cannabis information resource that connects consumers with vendors or likeminded individuals. iWeedz streamlines the process of finding the right strains and products for your ailments comfortably, fast and simple. Whether you're new to cannabis, a medical marijuana patient, or simply a recreational consumer, iWeedz is the perfect destination. iWeedz.com for vendors will be a cloud based solution to manage inventory, post daily deals, attract new customer with proximity marketing via mobile phones, engage with customers via email and text messaging and offer payment processing. The Company will operate its technology platform through its soon relaunched Website located at www.iWeedz.com, and through its mobile application for Apple iPhone operating system (iOS) and Android operating systems. The move to revitalize the iWeedz platform comes at a time when Shoppers Drug Mart, Canada's largest pharmacy chain, has formally applied to be a distributor of medical marijuana. With more than 1,200 locations across Canada including Pharmaprix in Quebec, Shoppers is the largest pharmacy chain in the country. According to the latest government data, just in Canada alone more than 75,000 Canadians had valid prescriptions for medical marijuana at the end of June — a figure that has tripled in the past year — and they had purchased a total of more than 4,000 kilograms of dried marijuana in the previous three months. That works out to a little less than a gram of pot per day, per person. Furthermore, in recent elections numerous states in the United States, including California, have approved to legalized marijuana. Greg Rotelli, Chief Executive Officer of U.S. Lithium, commented “We spent several years developing the iWeedz platform. We are exploring ways of streamlining the marijuana industry for both consumers and vendors by providing cutting edge scalable solutions that remain easy to use. In researching various opportunities, it was important for us to look at opportunities that were scalable and trendy. With the Green Rush trend, we felt that we could not ignore the interest by the investment community; we felt iWeedz was the right move as it is scalable and can solve a lot of problems consumers and vendors in marijuana commerce are experiencing. As a Company, we feel there is tremendous opportunity for our investors with this diversified approach especially with various upcoming state legislations looking to legalize marijuana.” About U.S. Lithium Corporation U.S. Lithium Corporation is an exploration and development company focused in North America on lithium and related resources for the rapidly growing energy storage industry. The Company looks to capitalize on opportunities within the lithium sector including providing lithium to the ever expanding next generation battery market.  Lithium demand is projected to triple by the year 2025 according to a recent report by Goldman Sachs and for many analysts is considered the new gasoline of the future. As the demand for lithium expands, U.S. Lithium Corp intends to be an integral part of this next booming industry. Our current focus is in the Basin and Range province of Nevada where the only producing lithium brine mine in North America, Albemarle’s Silver Peak Project, is located.  Elon, our first project, is located in Clayton Valley and is in close proximity to Silver Peak and several other active explorers and developers. Additionally, the Company has previously developed the iWeedz platform that connects consumers with vendors in the cannabis industry.

Lithium




What is Lithium?
Lithium is a the chemical element with an atomic number 3, a soft silver-white metal. It is the lightest of the alkali metals.
Uses of Lithium
Electrical and Electronics:

Lithium batteries are usually disposable with lithium compounds as an anode.

Lithium niobates (lithium, niobium and oxygen) are used extensively in telecommunication products such as mobile phones and optical modulators.

Chemicals:

Lithium chloride & lithium bromide are extremely hygroscopic (the ability of a substance to attract water molecules from the surrounding environment through either absorption or adsorption.) and are used as desiccant (Induces or sustains a state of dryness in its local vicinity in a moderately well-sealed container).
Used in preparation of organo-lithium compounds to create strong bases in opposition of strong alkaline composites.

General Engineering:

Lithium stearate is a common all-purpose, high-temperature lubricant.
Promotes the fusing of metals while eliminating the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities from the base elements.

Optics:

Lithium fluoride, artificially grown as crystal, is clear and transparent and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications.
Sometimes used in focal lenses, including spectacles.

Rocket Propulsion:

Its complex hydrides, such a Li[AlH4], are used as high energy additives to rocket propellants.

Nuclear:

Lithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb.
Lithium fluoride (highly enriched in the common isotope lithium-7) forms the basic constituent of the preferred fluoride salt mixture (LiF-BeF2) used in liquid-fluoride nuclear reactors.

U.S. LITHIUM CORP
About U.S. Lithium Corporation
U.S. Lithium Corporation is an exploration and development company focused in North America on lithium and related resources for the rapidly growing energy storage industry. The Company looks to capitalize on opportunities within the lithium sector including providing lithium to the ever expanding next generation battery market. Lithium demand is projected to triple by the year 2025 according to a recent report by Goldman Sachs and for many analysts is considered the new gasoline of the future. As the demand for lithium expands, U.S. Lithium Corp intends to be an integral part of this next booming industry. Our current focus is in the Basin and Range province of Nevada where the only producing lithium brine mine in North America, Albemarle’s Silver Peak Project, is located. Elon, our first project, is located in Clayton Valley and is in close proximity to Silver Peak and several other active explorers and developers.
