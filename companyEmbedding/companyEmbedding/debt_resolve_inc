Why debt settlement is a better option.




With a successfully-negotiated settlement, you can avoid overbearing processes like consolidation (combining debts from several creditors), bankruptcy (negatively impacting credit for up to 10 years), and debt management (can take up to twice as long as debt settlement and be twice as expensive).


There are multiple ways to relieve your debt, but debt settlement can be the best option for most people. And you’re in luck, because that’s our specialty.

"Spare of the moment to decide to go to …"
Spare of the moment to decide to go to them, entire transaction was explained and good to go in a couple hours.  All was put into motion before the next billing cycle of creditors due date.  I would recommend this one over the many I receive by mail, they didn't contact me I went to them and they listened.  Staff is very courteous and considerate, understanding you as a person and in my case didn't choose to be in this financial position but bad stuff happens.

Are you in over your head in debt? Are you barely making ends meet? Use our free debt calculator to calculate your debt to income ratio and see how risky your financial situation.
1. Enter in your total unsecured debt – this includes credit cards, personal loans, medical bills and other unsecured debts.

4. Press calculate and see how long it will take you to get out of debt with the popular debt reduction methods.






The Debt Calculator
This is a free debt analysis that starts with your monthly income before taxes and then asks for some common expenses like your monthly rent or mortgage payment, your car payment, and debt payments.

Consolidate Your Debts& Save




Consolidate Your Debts and Save

If you need to get relief from multiple high interest credit cards or other unsecured debts – such as medical bills, store charge cards, gas cards, or more – a debt consolidation program may be able to help you get out of debt much faster. This could, not only help to reduce stress, but also save you a substantial amount of money. 
Debt consolidation programs, also known as debt management plans (or DMPs), are typically coordinated through a credit or debt counselor who will take the time to go over your current financial situation, look at your unsecured debts, look at how much you can afford to pay each month toward your debts, then submit proposals to creditors on your behalf requesting relief. 
Overall, the goal of a debt consolidation program is to provide you with a proven and predicable way to combine or "consolidate" all your debts into a single payment each month by providing a personalized plan that, if followed each month, can help you get out of debt at an accelerated rate. 
Debt consolidation could help you: 

Reduce Your Interest Rates
Lower Monthly Payments
Remove Late Fees and Penalties

Get Rid of Credit Card Debt Faster

If you have high interest, or high balance credit cards, you may be on a "credit card

While avoiding non-essential credit card purchases, and paying down your debts each month, can help you get out of debt – a proven debt relief program may be able to help you get out of debt considerably faster.
Depending on your current financial situation, there are several debt relief programs that may be able to provide you with much needed credit card relief, including:

Debt Consolidation Program (Reduce interest, waive late fees and penalties, consolidate high interest debt into one lower monthly payment)
Debt Settlement Program (Settle high balance credit card debt for much  less than you currently owe)

Depending on the debt relief program that best meets your needs, your free debt relief evaluation can provide you with a projection of how much debt relief could save you – as well as the estimated time required to get out of credit card debt.

If you have high-interest credit cards and other debts and are need of relief – a debt consolidation program could simply your life, help you save money, and get out of debt faster by reducing your interest rates. Though a free debt relief analysis, a debt
        specialist will go over your existing debts, current interest, and financial situation – then make proposals to each of your creditors on your behalf, requesting lower interest rates and often more favorable repayment terms. 
Each creditor who agrees to the proposals are then added to the "debt management plan" – which can not only lower interest rates and remove late fees and penalties – but also help you get on a faster track to get out of debt.

Settle Credit Cards for Less?




Settle Credit Card Debts for Less?


        If you have one or more high-balance credit card debts and need to "settle" your debt for less than you owe – a credit card debt settlement program could save a substantial amount of money. 
When credit card companies decide to sell off their "bad debt" to debt collection agencies, it is not unusual for credit card companies to sell the debt for as little as ten cents on the dollar. This is not to say that credit card companies will agree to "settle" credit card debt for as little as ten percent of the amount owed, but it stands to reason that credit card companies are often willing to accept a reasonable offer from consumers in distress who offer to pay what they can afford.
A personalized debt relief analysis can provide a savings estimate for credit card settlement. How much debt settlement could save depends largely on the amount of credit card debt involved, the debtor's current financial situation – and the settlement policies of individual creditors.

Consolidate Your Debts& Save




Consolidate Your Debts and Save

If you need to get relief from multiple high interest credit cards or other unsecured debts – such as medical bills, store charge cards, gas cards, or more – a debt consolidation program may be able to help you get out of debt much faster. This could, not only help to reduce stress, but also save you a substantial amount of money. 
Debt consolidation programs, also known as debt management plans (or DMPs), are typically coordinated through a credit or debt counselor who will take the time to go over your current financial situation, look at your unsecured debts, look at how much you can afford to pay each month toward your debts, then submit proposals to creditors on your behalf requesting relief. 
Overall, the goal of a debt consolidation program is to provide you with a proven and predicable way to combine or "consolidate" all your debts into a single payment each month by providing a personalized plan that, if followed each month, can help you get out of debt at an accelerated rate. 
Debt consolidation could help you: 

Reduce Your Interest Rates
Lower Monthly Payments
Remove Late Fees and Penalties
Simplify Your Life with One Payment

Pay off Credit CardDebts Faster




Get Rid of Credit Card Debt Faster

If you have high interest, or high balance credit cards, you may be on a "credit card
        debt treadmill" that has become very stressful, and more than you can handle on your own.  While avoiding non-essential credit card purchases, and paying down your debts each month, can help you get out of debt – a proven debt relief program may be able to help you get out of debt considerably faster.
Depending on your current financial situation, there are several debt relief programs that may be able to provide you with much needed credit card relief, including:

Debt Consolidation Program (Reduce interest, waive late fees and penalties, consolidate high interest debt into one lower monthly payment)
Debt Settlement Program (Settle high balance credit card debt for much  less than you currently owe)

Depending on the debt relief program that best meets your needs, your free debt relief evaluation can provide you with a projection of how much debt relief could save you – as well as the estimated time required to get out of credit card debt.

Reduce Your Interest Rates




Reduce Your Interest Rates

If you have high-interest credit cards and other debts and are need of relief – a debt consolidation program could simply your life, help you save money, and get out of debt faster by reducing your interest rates. Though a free debt relief analysis, a debt
        specialist will go over your existing debts, current interest, and financial situation – then make proposals to each of your creditors on your behalf, requesting lower interest rates and often more favorable repayment terms. 
Each creditor who agrees to the proposals are then added to the "debt management plan" – which can not only lower interest rates and remove late fees and penalties – but also help you get on a faster track to get out of debt.

Settle Credit Cards for Less?




Settle Credit Card Debts for Less?


        If you have one or more high-balance credit card debts and need to "settle" your debt for less than you owe – a credit card debt settlement program could save a substantial amount of money. 
When credit card companies decide to sell off their "bad debt" to debt collection agencies, it is not unusual for credit card companies to sell the debt for as little as ten cents on the dollar. This is not to say that credit card companies will agree to "settle" credit card debt for as little as ten percent of the amount owed, but it stands to reason that credit card companies are often willing to accept a reasonable offer from consumers in distress who offer to pay what they can afford.
A personalized debt relief analysis can provide a savings estimate for credit card settlement. How much debt settlement could save depends largely on the amount of credit card debt involved, the debtor's current financial situation – and the settlement policies of individual creditors.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.

The BBB has requested information from this company to determine its compliance with the FTC rules governing debt relief companies, but the business has not provided the BBB with the requested information. Consequently, the BBB cannot determine the company's compliance with the FTC rules, so we urge prospective customers to seek such information directly from the company. More information regarding the FTC rules can be found at the following link:

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Management Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  The quarter ending June 30, 2015 is the second quarter of results that demonstrate the financial impact of the first phase of our new strategy. The operating income derived in the latest quarter was the first quarterly operating income reported by Debt Resolve, Inc. This operating income was generated entirely by our new joint venture, Progress Advocates LLC. To maintain the pace of growth demonstrated in this quarter, management is focused on the continued execution of our new business strategy. The key elements of our business growth strategy are to:  * Develop Progress Advocates LLC, a Debt Resolve, Inc. joint venture, into a profitable growth business that is sustainable in an industry of changing regulations and operating conditions. Included in this development are industry leading practices from technology integration to customer education and care. The external financing option introduced in March 2015 was a key contributor in the quarter ending June 30, 2015. This and revised cash financing options are aligned to match the timing of the client payment with U.S. Department of Education loan modification approvals, an important concern of State and Federal regulators. To support these goals, new technologies are being implemented to integrate the sales and customer service platforms with external data sources. This has sped up client approvals and reduced required sales cycle time. Another key focus is to expand the marketing plan of external lead purchases with prospect self-identification through branded web properties and social media participation. Education programs are now available to explain the government programs and terminology and will be expanded to assist clients with all debt management, and where to go for other resources. The goal is to develop a customer relationship that benefits the consumer with increased financial knowledge, develops brand awareness and encourages our inclusion in the consumer's social media world.  * Leverage our technology and knowledge of consumer financial dispute negotiations to launch a new internet based product in the consumer to consumer financial dispute resolution and collection space. This product, named Settl.it was soft launched in mid-June 2015 to provide additional market feedback on the User Interface and its value to targeted cohorts. Settl.it utilizes our patented blind bidding system that we license and is the first consumer product available with online negotiations technology. Designed to be simple to understand, easy to use, but an effective settlement tool, our goal is to make Settl.it an online leader in this industry. In addition, the product was designed to be enhanced at a future date to meet the needs of the small business marketplace.  * Enhance the Debt Resolve Solution by integrating it with other services to become a total solution for the ARM market. The initial focus will be the health industry including hospitals and medical practices. Our solution will offer a single vendor revenue management system from day one billing through late stage collections. Our partners in this solution are experienced professionals with health industry experiences including billing, call center management, and all stages of bill collections. Another focus will be a complete solution for hospital financing companies. Our potential partner in providing this solution has been a successful provider of financial services to this industry. In each industry, the marketing strategy will center on building a customer success story and leveraging that reference account with marketing materials, industry speaking engagements, and our partner's sales team to expand to similar industry accounts.  * Leverage our public equity financial structure by purchasing equity interests in private companies that will benefit from the experience and skills of our management and consultants as well as from holding our publicly traded equity. For Debt Resolve, each purchase will aim to be accretive to earnings and leverage our assets with little additional expense. For our partners, our involvement is aimed to accelerate their growth and profitability. In combination with our equity structure, this will allow them to monetize their years of hard work building a private company. The Progress Advocates LLC joint venture was our first such investment. Our intent is to attract others that will be synergistic to our current portfolio and offer the benefits described above.  Our Strategy Plan Progress  Progress Advocates LLC (PA) has been in operation for seven months and has met its revenue and expense budget each month. In the quarter ending June 30, 2015, it has increased its revenue 319% sequentially quarter over quarter, turned profitable, and is now self-sustaining on a cash flow basis. The external financing option introduced in March 2015 to allow consumers to pay for its services with a low monthly payment, was a key contributor in the quarter ending June 30, 2015. As with other Progress Advocates' payment options, the consumer typically doesn't pay until they receive confirmation of their reduced U.S. Direct Student Loan payment amount, an important concern of State and Federal regulators. Both of these are industry leading practices. Other enhancements are being developed to assist the consumer in understanding and managing other non-student loans, as well as providing consumer financial education. These relationship building products should reduce potential churn and increase low cost referral sales.  Settl.it, our new consumer to consumer debt negotiation and settlement product, has been in live beta testing for the last four weeks. Testers have been enthusiastic over its simplicity and elegance of design. It should be ready for a national launch in September, followed by a more aggressive marketing effort starting in October.  Negotiations with potential partners for a complete solution for the ARM industry are nearing completion and targeted clients have been receptive to our proposal of these new services. Additional work has been completed with current Debt Resolve, Inc. clients, towards understanding their needs for product enhancements. While this is an ongoing process, work has been completed on some of these requirements with plans to complete the rest. As a key component to this work is a redesign of the user interface to simplify it and convey a softer, friendlier tone in what can be a stressful debt collection environment.  We have been approached by several privately held businesses to discuss the benefits of being part of the Debt Resolve, Inc. equity family. Some of these discussions have continued, while others weren't a good fit for one or the other parties. We are excited by the opportunity that our equity structure and the skills of our management team can offer smaller privately held companies.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2014  Revenues  Revenues totaled $1,439,674 and $42,815 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We earned revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 as a percent of debt collected, on a fee per settlement and on a flat monthly fee basis. In addition, in December 2014, we began deriving revenue from fees for providing student loan document preparation services. The increased revenue mainly resulted from our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC of $1,412,604 for the three month ending June 30, 2015 as compared to $-0- for the same period last year.  Costs and Expenses  Payroll and related expenses. Payroll and related expenses amounted to $484,254 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $211,833 for the three months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of $272,421. Stock based compensation was $10,829 and $94,663 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease mainly resulted from a reduction in preferred warrants issued to service providers. The increase in payroll mainly resulted from our staffing from our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC with payroll costs of $353,650 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $-0- in 2014.  General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses amounted to $677,755 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $172,545 for the three months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of $505,210. Of the increase, $588,543 was incurred from our subsidiary in the current year, as compared to $-0- for the three months ended June 30, 2014. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the most significant expense incurred by Progress Advocates as general and administrative expenses were marketing, advertising and promotion of $567,800 as we ramp up our business activity.  Gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities. During the three months June 30, 2015, we had the possibility of exceeding common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares that may be issuable to satisfy settlement provisions of these agreements after consideration of all existing instruments that could be settled in shares. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires us to reclassify the derivative from equity to a liability at their fair values as of the date possible issuable shares exceeded the authorized level and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. For the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a gain on change in fair value of these derivative liabilities of $267,532 and $1,273,701, respectively.  Gain on settlement and write off of debt. During the three months June 30, 2015, we settled or wrote off old outstanding accounts payable for less than the recorded liability and recognized a gain on old debt. As such, we reported a gain of $650,319 and $-0- for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Interest (expense). We recorded interest expense of $541,225 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to interest expense of $89,395 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Interest expense increased primarily due to a factoring arrangement used by our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates. In the current period, they incurred $415,818 as compared to $-0- in 2014.  Amortization of deferred debt discount. Amortization expense of $22,404 and $11,375 was incurred for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the amortization of the value of the deferred debt discount associated with certain of our notes payable. Amortization expense increased due to new notes added in 2014 and 2015.  Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2014  Revenues  Revenues totaled $1,909,767 and $85,071 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We earned revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 as a percent of debt collected, on a fee per settlement and on a flat monthly fee basis. In addition, in December 2014, we began deriving revenue from fees for providing student loan document preparation services. The increased revenue mainly resulted from our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC of $1,795,632 for the six month ending June 30, 2015 as compared to $-0- for the same period last year.  Costs and Expenses  Payroll and related expenses. Payroll and related expenses amounted to $822,458 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $291,935 for the six months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of $530,523. Stock based compensation was $18,205 and $100,913 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease mainly resulted from reduced issuance of preferred warrants to service providers. The increase in payroll mainly resulted from our staffing from our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC with payroll costs of $610,500 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $-0- in 2014.  General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses amounted to $1,426,362 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $322,579 for the six months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of $1,103,783. Of the increase, $1,093,172 was incurred from our subsidiary in the current year, as compared to $-0- for the six months ended June 30, 2014. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the most significant expense incurred by Progress Advocates as general and administrative expenses were marketing, advertising and promotion of $926,600 as we ramp up our business model.  Gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities. During the six months June 30, 2015, we had the possibility of exceeding common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares that may be issuable to satisfy settlement provisions of these agreements after consideration of all existing instruments that could be settled in shares. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires us to reclassify the derivative from equity to a liability at their fair values as of the date possible issuable shares exceeded the authorized level and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. For the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a gain on change in fair value of these derivative liabilities of $340,831 and $307,338, respectively.  Gain on settlement and write off of debt. During the six months June 30, 2015, we settled or wrote off old outstanding accounts payable for less than the recorded liability. As such, we reported a gain of $650,319 and $320 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Interest (expense). We recorded interest expense of $648,801 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to interest expense of $169,218 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Interest expense increased primarily due to our factoring arrangement we have with our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates. In the current period, we incurred $415,818 as compared to $-0- in 2014.  Amortization of deferred debt discount. Amortization expense of $41,976 and $14,479 was incurred for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the amortization of the value of the deferred debt discount associated with certain of our notes payable. Amortization expense increased due to new notes added in 2014 and 2015.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of June 30, 2015, we had a working capital deficiency (total current liabilities exceeded total current assets) in the amount of $6,101,683 and cash and cash equivalents totaling $224,230. We reported a net income of $113,578 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net cash used in operating activities was $611,766 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Cash flow provided by financing activities was $780,391 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, we had a working capital deficiency (total current liabilities exceeded total current assets) in the amount of $5,197,474 and cash and cash equivalents totaling $55,605.  Our working capital as of the date of this report is negative and is not sufficient to fund our plan of operations for the next year. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  We have successfully raised capital for our day-to-day operations since our inception; however, no assurance can be provided that we will continue to be able to do so. There is no assurance that any funds secured will be sufficient to enable us to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that we are unsuccessful, we may need to curtail our operations and implement a plan to extend payables and reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. At any time until substantial capital is raised or we reach cash flow breakeven, there is also a significant risk of bankruptcy. There can be no assurance that any plan to raise additional funding will be successful. It is quite challenging in the current environment to raise money. Depending on the pace of our revenue growth, it may not be possible to demonstrate the progress investors require to secure additional funding. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on our management's judgment and available information and, consequently, actual results could be different from these estimates. The significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are as follows:  Revenue Recognition  We earn revenue from collection agencies, collection law firms and lenders that implemented our online system. Our current contracts provide for revenue based on a percentage of the amount of debt collected, a fee per settlement or through a flat monthly fee. Although other revenue models have been proposed, most revenue earned to date has been determined using these methods, and such revenue is recognized when the settlement amount of debt is collected by the client or at the beginning of the month for a flat fee. While the percent of debt collected will continue to be a revenue recognition method going forward, other payment models are also being offered to clients and may possibly become our preferred revenue model. Dependent upon the structure of future contracts, revenue may be derived from a combination of set up fees or flat monthly or annual fees with transaction fees upon debt settlement, fees per account loaded or fees per settlement.  Revenues for the preparation of student loan documentation services are earned when the Company has substantially accomplished the agreed-upon deliverables to be entitled to payment by the client. For most current active clients, these deliverables consist of the completion and delivery of the student loan modification and consolidation documentation package on behalf of the client to the U.S. Department of Education. The Company may sell its products separately or in various bundles that include multiple elements such as upfront fees, annual renewals and other services.  We defer any revenue for which the product or service has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.  Stock-based compensation  We follow Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 718-10, Stock-based Compensation ("ASC 718-10"). The standards require the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee's requisite service period.  Fair Values  Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825-10") requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term borrowings, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.  We follow Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820-10") and Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825-10"), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. None of these statements had an impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Derivative Liability  We account for derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.  Recently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements  See recently adopted and issued accounting standards in "Note 2-Significant accounting policies" in Item 1. Financial statements of this report.  Statement Relating to Forward-Looking Statements  This report contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions and information currently available to us. When used in this report, the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "potential" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties concerning our recent research and development activities; the risks and uncertainties concerning acceptance of our services and products, if and when fully developed, by our potential customers; our present financial condition and the risks and uncertainties concerning the availability of additional capital as and when required; the risks and uncertainties concerning the Limited License Agreement with Messrs. Brofman and Burchetta; the risks and uncertainties concerning our dependence on our key executives; the risks and uncertainties concerning technological changes and the competition for our services and products; the risks and uncertainties concerning general economic conditions; and the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed on April 13, 2015, in the section labeled "Risk Factors." Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, all of which speak only as of the date of this report.  Aug 14, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

"Spare of the moment to decide to go to …"
Spare of the moment to decide to go to them, entire transaction was explained and good to go in a couple hours.  All was put into motion before the next billing cycle of creditors due date.  I would recommend this one over the many I receive by mail, they didn't contact me I went to them and they listened.  Staff is very courteous and considerate, understanding you as a person and in my case didn't choose to be in this financial position but bad stuff happens.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
