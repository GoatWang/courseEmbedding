Our Philosophy - Portfolio Management





Long-term fundamental value

Markets often misprice securities. Prices deviate from fundamental fair value, but over time, they adjust to reflect inflation, credit quality fundamentals and liquidity conditions. Consistently investing in undervalued securities can deliver superior investment returns.
                    
We can systematically identify mispricings. We believe we can identify and capitalize on markets and securities that are priced below fundamental fair value. We do this through disciplined and rigorous analysis, comparing prices to the fundamental fair values estimated by our macroeconomic and credit research teams around the globe.
                    
                    
Our portfolios emphasize our highest convictions. The greater the difference between our view of fair value and markets' pricing, the bigger the potential value opportunity. The greater the degree of confidence in our view of fundamentals, the greater the emphasis of the strategies in our portfolios.
                    




Multiple diversified strategies

We seek diversified sources of returns. Our objective is to meet or exceed our investors' performance objectives within their tolerances for risk. We seek to diversify investments and add value across interest rate duration, yield curve, sector allocation, security selection, country and currency strategies.  We deploy multiple diversified strategies that benefit in different environments so no one strategy dominates performance, helping to dampen volatility.

Fed Balance Sheet Normalization: When Boring Is Good
by Bonnie M. Wongtrakool
At the start of 2017, Federal Reserve (Fed) members began sharing their views on the Fed’s balance sheet with increasing frequency. This renewed attention to balance sheet normalization brought back memories of the 2013 “taper tantrum,” with some investors warning that the Fed’s exit from the Treasu...

Gilt Yields: How Low Is Too Low?
by Andrew J. Belshaw
With UK government gilt yields near historic lows, the prevailing wisdom is that gilts are now prohibitively expensive and wise investors should steer clear. For those of us with long memories, this view is reminiscent of the experience of the Japanese government bond market 20 years ago, when Japan...

Dry Facts About the New SEC Liquidity Rules

On September 22, 2015, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released a 415-page document—Investment Company Act Release No. 31835—that proposed “…rules and forms designed to promote effective liquidity risk management throughout the open-end fund industry, thereby reducing the risk that f...

Macro Opportunities: A Flexible Approach to Macro Investing

In 2012, Western Asset set out to develop an aggressive, unconstrained fixed-income strategy—Macro Opportunities (MO)—to offer our clients the opportunity to generate returns in a slow-growth, low-rate environment. It needed to be both opportunistic and defensive, yet offer a compelling risk/reward ...

Hung by the Polls: Mayhem in June

When to hold and when to fold—the keys to success that every gambler knows. Prime Minister Theresa May clearly didn’t heed that sentiment when she decided in mid-April to call an early election, thereby forsaking  a guaranteed three further years as Prime Minister for the prospect of a larger and lo...

Fed Hiking, But Not Tightening

The Federal Reserve (Fed) raised the federal funds target rate as expected on Wednesday despite unspectacular growth, underwhelming inflation and only modest wage growth. The Fed certainly took all of these factors into account, as well as considering the positive growth in the US and improving grow...

Toward LDI Solutions That Actually Work

You are a defined-benefit (DB) pension plan sponsor who has improved funded status to the point where you want to seriously de-risk via a customized Liability Driven Investing (LDI) solution. What kind of allocation should you adopt? Most of our competitors would advise building a solution portfolio...

Market Commentary

Less than a year ago, a prevailing topic of discussion among the economic academic community and market participants was “secular stagnation.” Developed countries would have paltry growth for the indefinite future. Policies and planning would have to adapt to this reality. Commodity prices had plumm...

What Goes Up, Can Go Down—How Durable Is the Recent Recovery in Global Inflation Rates?

The path of global inflation is rightly never far from the minds of monetary policymakers and investors. Until recently, however, the global central banks’ emphasis has been upon avoiding deflation rather than restraining inflation. Last year’s US election result changed this, fostering a fiscally l...

Offering Income in a Yield-Starved World: Multi-Asset Credit (MAC) at Western Asset

In today’s low-interest-rate world, finding an attractive source of income remains a challenge for individual investors, pension funds and institutions globally. The challenge stems from both the myriad investment opportunities now available, as well as the inherent complexities surrounding asset al...

Emerging Markets Debt

Western Asset continues to be constructive on emerging markets debt (EMD) as we believe fundamentals, valuations and technicals are still likely to be supportive of the asset class over the medium-term. Global central bank accommodation has helped remove tail-risk scenarios and put a floor on global...

Europe Still Deciding: French Presidential Elections, April/May

With just under a week to go, the first round of the French presidential elections is upon us, and some worry it will follow in the footsteps of the political tsunamis of 2016. Until recently seemingly a two-horse race, the polls now suggest convergence on an almost-equal probability for each of the...

Why Tax Reform Lowers Interest Rates

Judging by financial market reaction and popular opinion, there is a strong consensus that prospective tax reform policies will lead to upward pressure on interest rates. We will argue here that the effects of reductions in marginal tax rates are at worst uncertain and that the presumption actually ...

As Fed Reinvestments End, New Opportunities Arise for Bond Investors

Through its first quantitative easing (QE) program, the Federal Reserve (Fed) began purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in November 2008 and US Treasuries (USTs) in March 2009. Since ending its third asset purchase program (QE3) in 2014, the Fed has continued to participate actively i...

Value and Diversification: Western Asset’s Philosophy in Action

Since our founding in 1971, Western Asset has grown to become one of the world’s leading fixed-income managers—yet our core philosophy remains unchanged. We believe in “value” and we believe in “diversification,” two tenets that are critical for success in meeting our clients’ investment objectives....

Europe Decides: Elections, 2017

After the political tsunamis of 2016—with the unexpected decisions by the British to leave the EU, and the Americans to elect Donald Trump president—the political nexus in 2017 shifts to the eurozone. The coming months herald parliamentary and presidential elections in the Netherlands, France and Ge...

Global Investing: The Price You Might Pay for Going Passive

We believe global bonds should have a role in your broad investment portfolio. The global bond market has grown dramatically over the past 20 years due to a number of secular forces and now offers investors a much richer universe of investment opportunities across a number of regions, sectors and cu...

Effective LDI: Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff

In pension management as in life, simple is usually better.

History[edit]
Early years (1971-1986)[edit]
Western Asset Management Company was founded in October 1971 by United California Bank (which later became First Interstate), and became an SEC-registered investment advisor in December of that year. In December 1986, Western Asset was acquired by Legg Mason, Inc., and is now an independent affiliate of that firm that operates as an autonomous investment management company.
Expansion (1996-present)[edit]
In February 1996, Legg Mason acquired Lehman Brothers Global Asset Management Limited, based in London, to broaden Western Asset's non-dollar capabilities. Now known as Western Asset Management Company Limited, it operates as the firm’s London office. To enhance its presence in Asia, Western Asset Management Company Pte. Ltd. was established in Singapore.
In December 2003, the fixed-income division of Rothschild Asset Management (Singapore) Limited was acquired by Legg Mason and merged into the existing operation. To further develop Western Asset's capabilities and global presence, Legg Mason acquired a substantial part of Citigroup's asset management business in exchange for its brokerage and capital markets business. As part of the transaction, Western Asset gained new offices in New York, São Paulo, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Melbourne, in addition to related staff and assets.
In December 2011, Western Asset opened a representative office in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to further expand its global footprint and better serve clients located in the region.

History[edit]
Early years (1971-1986)[edit]
Western Asset Management Company was founded in October 1971 by United California Bank (which later became First Interstate), and became an SEC-registered investment advisor in December of that year. In December 1986, Western Asset was acquired by Legg Mason, Inc., and is now an independent affiliate of that firm that operates as an autonomous investment management company.
Expansion (1996-present)[edit]
In February 1996, Legg Mason acquired Lehman Brothers Global Asset Management Limited, based in London, to broaden Western Asset's non-dollar capabilities. Now known as Western Asset Management Company Limited, it operates as the firm’s London office. To enhance its presence in Asia, Western Asset Management Company Pte. Ltd. was established in Singapore.
In December 2003, the fixed-income division of Rothschild Asset Management (Singapore) Limited was acquired by Legg Mason and merged into the existing operation. To further develop Western Asset's capabilities and global presence, Legg Mason acquired a substantial part of Citigroup's asset management business in exchange for its brokerage and capital markets business. As part of the transaction, Western Asset gained new offices in New York, São Paulo, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Melbourne, in addition to related staff and assets.
In December 2011, Western Asset opened a representative office in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to further expand its global footprint and better serve clients located in the region.

What should I know before investing?
Fixed income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation and reinvestment risks; and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities falls. State-specific funds are more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that particular state and its municipalities than are funds that invest in securities of many states. An investor may be subject to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax, and state and local taxes may apply. Capital gains, if any, are fully taxable. High-yield bonds possess greater price volatility, illiquidity and possibility of default.








IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
Carefully consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. Please view the prospectus or summary prospectus for this and other information. Read it carefully.
FINANCIAL ADVISORS: Please note that not all share classes may be available for sale at your firm. Please call the Legg Mason Sales Desk 1-800-822-5544 or your Legg Mason Sales contact for more information.
An investment in a money market fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the principal. Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss. Fixed income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks; and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities falls. The risks of lower-rated, higher-yielding securities include greater price volatility, illiquidity and possibility of default. Municipal securities purchased by the Fund may be adversely affected by changes in the financial condition of municipal issuers and insurers, regulatory and political developments, uncertainties and public perceptions, and other factors. The Fund may use derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Leverage may result in greater volatility of NAV and the market price of common shares and increases a shareholder’s risk of loss. Certain investors may be subject to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and state and local taxes may apply. Capital gains, if any, are fully taxable.

Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change. 

Tapering of the Federal Reserve Board’s quantitative easing program and a general rise in interest rates may lead to increased portfolio volatility.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price or NAV, and assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price or NAV, respectively. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.

 Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.

 Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund’s NAV.
*Distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution amount paid, excluding special distributions, divided by the closing market price or NAV. As of 06/30/2017, the fund estimates that the distributions will be paid from: 100.00% investment income;0.00% realized capital gains; and, 0.00% return of capital. The Distribution Rate is subject to change and is not a quotation of Fund performance. The Board of Directors may terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time. Any such termination or suspension could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment. For more information about a distribution's composition refer to the Fund's distribution press release or, if applicable, the Section 19 notice located in the Press Releases section below.



























A NOTE ABOUT FEES & EXPENSES: Based on the Fund’s net assets of the common shares, as of the most recent Annual Report.
Management fees: Under the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an annual fee, paid monthly, as a portion of the Fund's average weekly net assets.  For purposes of calculating this fee, the liquidation value of any outstanding Preferred Stock of the Fund is not deducted in determining the Fund’s net assets. Please see the fund’s Annual Report for more information on expenses.

 Characteristics

IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS INFORMATION: Portfolio characteristics and holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. 

Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
 


Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital.

A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the performance section on this page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section below. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment.

Press Releases





IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested.

Pricing & Performance

Literature










Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price and the deduction of all fund expenses. Returns based on NAV assume the reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all fund expenses. Year-To-Date (YTD) returns are calculated from January 1st of the reporting year and not annualized.
Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund's NAV.
The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution amount paid, excluding special distributions, divided by the closing market price or NAV as of the date indicated. Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found on each fund's Overview page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section of each individual product page. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment. Please go to the individual product pages for information relating to the composition of the quoted distribution rates. 
 
Effective June 1, 2017, the following Funds changed their security pricing methodology to now use the mean value of the bid and ask prices (of underlying fund holdings) to calculate the NAV: Western Asset Income Fund and Western Asset Premier Bond Fund.  Funds may show a one-time increase of the NAV, which is due to this change in pricing methodology.


























The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. Note that unlike other closed-end funds, Western Asset Middle Market Debt Fund, and Western Asset Middle Market Income Fund are not publicly traded and closed to new investors.
