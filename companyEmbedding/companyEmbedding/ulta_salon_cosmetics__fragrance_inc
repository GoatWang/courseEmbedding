History[edit]
Ulta Salon, Cosmetics and Fragrance was founded by Richard E. George, the former President of Osco Drug, Inc. Following his tenure, Terry J. Hanson, another Osco veteran, became the CEO. In September 1996, Hanson hired Charles "Rick" Weber, another Osco veteran, to be Chief Financial Officer. In December 1999, Lyn Kirby, formerly of Sears Circle of Beauty, became the President and Chief Executive Officer and Weber became Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The two ran the business together until Weber left in September 2006 when he was selected by Tom Stemberg, founder of Staples, to become Chairman and Chief Executive officer of Rec Room Furniture and Games, Inc.[4] On October 25, 2007, the company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ. In 2008, the company opened a second distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona. On April 26, 2010, Ulta announced that Mr. Carl "Chuck" Rubin would be appointed as Chief Operating Officer, President, and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective May 10, 2010. According to public filings, Chuck Rubin earned over $11.1MM in 2010, making him one of the 20 highest paid CEOs in Chicago.[5]




Ulta Beauty, Ann Arbor, Michigan


On June 24, 2013, it was announced that Mary Dillon would be appointed as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2013. Mary Dillon previously held positions as the former chief of U.S. Cellular and senior executive at McDonald's and PepsiCo.[6]
Finances[edit]
Ulta Beauty sales were $713.8 million for the first quarter ending in May 2014.[7] At the end of the second quarter ending in August 2014, Ulta Beauty reported that total sales increased by 22.2 percent and comparable store sales Increased 9.6 percent.[8] Wall Street expected the company's total sales to reach $3.19 billion for the fiscal year ending in February 2015, which would be almost three times the amount of Ulta Beauty's sales levels in 2009.[9]
Locations[edit]
In 2013, Ulta opened 125 stores in the United States, bringing their total number of locations to 675 stores. They also announced plans to open 100 more locations by the end of 2014.[10] As of January 28, 2017, Ulta operates 974 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia.[1] A majority of Ulta Beauty stores are located in the East Coast region, however on the West Coast, California also has a large presence of company-owned stores.[11] Ulta said it aims to have 1,000 stores located in the United States sometime during 2017.[12]
Brands[edit]
Ulta Beauty offers both high-end and drugstore cosmetics, skincare, and fragrances.[13] High-end brands sold at Ulta include bareMinerals, Benefit Cosmetics, Clinique, Smashbox, Stila, Urban Decay, AmazingCosmetics and Tarte. Drugstore brands include Covergirl, L'Oréal, Maybelline, NYX Cosmetics, and Revlon. Ulta Beauty also sells its own brand of makeup, bath and body products, skincare, haircare, nail polish, and fragrances. In May 2017, MAC Cosmetics became available for purchase online,[14] with products scheduled to be in stores beginning in June 2017.[15]
Services[edit]
Ulta has a salon located in every store nationwide. The store format includes a 950 square feet salon area with eight to ten stations. The salon has a concierge desk, skin treatment room, and semi-private shampoo and hair color processing areas. It offers services including hair cuts and hair coloring from Redken-trained hair stylists, skin treatments and facials from Dermalogica trained skin therapists, and manicures from OPI trained professionals.[16]
Benefit Brow Bar[edit]
Ulta Beauty has Benefit Brow Bars located in most stores. Benefit Brow Bar services include brow arching, brow tinting, facial waxing, and eyelash application.[17] The Benefit Brow Bar has become an increasingly popular addition to the Ulta stores as we see an increase in the focus of eyebrows; because of this the Benefit Brow Bar is often excluded from the many promotions held by the company.
Charitable giving[edit]
Starting in 2008, Ulta Beauty's focus in charity giving was The Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Their charitable donations fund research related to the causes, treatment, and possible prevention of breast cancer. By supporting this cause, which benefits women, their families, and their loved ones across the nation, Ulta Beauty seeks to not only bring a greater sense of community amongst women worldwide but also raise awareness about the importance of finding a cure.[18]
Ulta Beauty also hosts programs such as their annual Donate with a Kiss campaign, which raises funds for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation throughout the month of October, Ulta Beauty's Annual Charity Gold Outing, as well as Ulta Beauty's Annual Cut-A-Thon, where customers donate ten dollars to the cause in exchange for a haircut. In 2012, ULTA Beauty raised over 2 million dollars for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[19] In 2014, Ulta Beauty partnered with Ellen DeGeneres during Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October and donated $1.5 million for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[20]
Customer Loyalty Program[edit]
Ulta Beauty's customer loyalty program called Ultamate Rewards allows customers to redeem points for every dollar spent on any in-store or online purchase they make with their membership card.[21]

History[edit]
Ulta Salon, Cosmetics and Fragrance was founded by Richard E. George, the former President of Osco Drug, Inc. Following his tenure, Terry J. Hanson, another Osco veteran, became the CEO. In September 1996, Hanson hired Charles "Rick" Weber, another Osco veteran, to be Chief Financial Officer. In December 1999, Lyn Kirby, formerly of Sears Circle of Beauty, became the President and Chief Executive Officer and Weber became Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The two ran the business together until Weber left in September 2006 when he was selected by Tom Stemberg, founder of Staples, to become Chairman and Chief Executive officer of Rec Room Furniture and Games, Inc.[4] On October 25, 2007, the company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ. In 2008, the company opened a second distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona. On April 26, 2010, Ulta announced that Mr. Carl "Chuck" Rubin would be appointed as Chief Operating Officer, President, and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective May 10, 2010. According to public filings, Chuck Rubin earned over $11.1MM in 2010, making him one of the 20 highest paid CEOs in Chicago.[5]




Ulta Beauty, Ann Arbor, Michigan


On June 24, 2013, it was announced that Mary Dillon would be appointed as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2013. Mary Dillon previously held positions as the former chief of U.S. Cellular and senior executive at McDonald's and PepsiCo.[6]
Finances[edit]
Ulta Beauty sales were $713.8 million for the first quarter ending in May 2014.[7] At the end of the second quarter ending in August 2014, Ulta Beauty reported that total sales increased by 22.2 percent and comparable store sales Increased 9.6 percent.[8] Wall Street expected the company's total sales to reach $3.19 billion for the fiscal year ending in February 2015, which would be almost three times the amount of Ulta Beauty's sales levels in 2009.[9]
Locations[edit]
In 2013, Ulta opened 125 stores in the United States, bringing their total number of locations to 675 stores. They also announced plans to open 100 more locations by the end of 2014.[10] As of January 28, 2017, Ulta operates 974 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia.[1] A majority of Ulta Beauty stores are located in the East Coast region, however on the West Coast, California also has a large presence of company-owned stores.[11] Ulta said it aims to have 1,000 stores located in the United States sometime during 2017.[12]
Brands[edit]
Ulta Beauty offers both high-end and drugstore cosmetics, skincare, and fragrances.[13] High-end brands sold at Ulta include bareMinerals, Benefit Cosmetics, Clinique, Smashbox, Stila, Urban Decay, AmazingCosmetics and Tarte. Drugstore brands include Covergirl, L'Oréal, Maybelline, NYX Cosmetics, and Revlon. Ulta Beauty also sells its own brand of makeup, bath and body products, skincare, haircare, nail polish, and fragrances. In May 2017, MAC Cosmetics became available for purchase online,[14] with products scheduled to be in stores beginning in June 2017.[15]
Services[edit]
Ulta has a salon located in every store nationwide. The store format includes a 950 square feet salon area with eight to ten stations. The salon has a concierge desk, skin treatment room, and semi-private shampoo and hair color processing areas. It offers services including hair cuts and hair coloring from Redken-trained hair stylists, skin treatments and facials from Dermalogica trained skin therapists, and manicures from OPI trained professionals.[16]
Benefit Brow Bar[edit]
Ulta Beauty has Benefit Brow Bars located in most stores. Benefit Brow Bar services include brow arching, brow tinting, facial waxing, and eyelash application.[17] The Benefit Brow Bar has become an increasingly popular addition to the Ulta stores as we see an increase in the focus of eyebrows; because of this the Benefit Brow Bar is often excluded from the many promotions held by the company.
Charitable giving[edit]
Starting in 2008, Ulta Beauty's focus in charity giving was The Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Their charitable donations fund research related to the causes, treatment, and possible prevention of breast cancer. By supporting this cause, which benefits women, their families, and their loved ones across the nation, Ulta Beauty seeks to not only bring a greater sense of community amongst women worldwide but also raise awareness about the importance of finding a cure.[18]
Ulta Beauty also hosts programs such as their annual Donate with a Kiss campaign, which raises funds for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation throughout the month of October, Ulta Beauty's Annual Charity Gold Outing, as well as Ulta Beauty's Annual Cut-A-Thon, where customers donate ten dollars to the cause in exchange for a haircut. In 2012, ULTA Beauty raised over 2 million dollars for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[19] In 2014, Ulta Beauty partnered with Ellen DeGeneres during Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October and donated $1.5 million for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[20]
Customer Loyalty Program[edit]
Ulta Beauty's customer loyalty program called Ultamate Rewards allows customers to redeem points for every dollar spent on any in-store or online purchase they make with their membership card.[21]

		Best Stocks for 2017: Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. (ULTA) Stock Is a Beauty	
ULTA stock boasts the leadership, fundamentals and good business sense

Dec 16, 2016, 1:15 pm EDT  |  By Tracey Ryniec, Equity Strategist and Portfolio Manager, Zacks Investment Research



 
  View All  

Editor’s note: This column is part of our Best Stocks for 2017 contest. Tracey Ryniec’s pick for the contest is Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA).
If you had to choose one stock to buy for 2017, your first thoughts probably wouldn’t go to the retail names.
2016 was, in general, a terrible year for America’s retailers. While employment continued to improve and wages finally started to rise, the consumer was in a funk. While they might have bought those tools from Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD), they completely shunned clothes of any kind and turned their backs on the big department stores.
In the weeks leading up to the presidential election, most retailers reported an even further slowdown in spending. It’s almost as if the consumer was paralyzed.
But the post-election world is a very different place. Retailers who reported earnings after the November election almost unequivocally said they saw a big jump in business in the weeks afterwards.
Consumers were spending again.
Will these new animal spirits last until 2017? No one knows. But many economic fundamentals seem to support the idea that this pick-up in consumer spending, and sentiment, could have legs.
The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017
The employment market continues to heat up. There’s also the possibility of infrastructure spending and tax cuts in the new year, which could boost economic growth further.
Additionally, the importance of the stock market indexes trading at new all-time highs shouldn’t be dismissed. When investors look at their investment statements and they see those balances rising, it can also boost the animal spirits. They feel richer. And when they feel richer, they spend more.
The First Rule of Investing: Buy the Best
If consumers are opening their wallets again, then investors should be in the very best of the retail group.
And there can be only one name that falls into that category.
Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA).
Ulta sells beauty products and operates salons in 949 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia.
Right now, ULTA stock is the only retailer that is producing double-digit comparable-store-sales quarter after quarter and year over year. Additionally, unlike most other retailers in 2016, Ulta didn’t see its business slow during the year. Quite the opposite occurred. It has actually accelerated.
Here are the quarterly comparable-store-sales for 2015 and 2016.
Fiscal 2015 Comparable Stores Sales Growth
Fiscal 2016 Comparable Store Sales Growth
Q1: 11.4%
Q1: 15.2%
Q2: 10.1%
Q2: 14.4%
Q3: 12.8%
Q3: 16.7%
Q4: 12.5%
Q4: ???
 
What other retailer is doing comparable store growth of 16.7% like Ulta did in the third quarter of this year?
No one.
It’s not even close. Ulta stands alone.
Why Ulta Crushes It
How is ULTA stock able to achieve this kind of success when other retailers have been faltering?
Let’s be frank. It helps that it’s not an apparel retailer. Makeup, in particular, has been an especially strong retail product line for the last several years and shows no signs of slowing down.
But outside of its products, it’s also doing several things right that allow it to trounce the competition.
1. Best Rewards Program In the Business
First, it has the best rewards program, the Ultamate Rewards, in the retail industry. The rewards program now accounts for 90% of all sales.
The reason it is so great is that it legitimately gives customers rewards. It makes it easy to accumulate points, which can then be applied to other products. So a customer in the program, knowing that they will get good freebies, will try and make as many purchases as they can through the rewards.
Not only will they buy their makeup at Ulta, but also buy their shampoo and even get their haircut there just to accumulate points.
The rewards program also provides a moat against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online retailers. Why would women buy their makeup on Ulta.com instead of Amazon, which often carries the same items, sometimes for less? Because they don’t get points on Amazon.
Points, and the rewards that come with them, are the name of the game. It has created an incredibly loyal customer base.

History[edit]
Ulta Salon, Cosmetics and Fragrance was founded by Richard E. George, the former President of Osco Drug, Inc. Following his tenure, Terry J. Hanson, another Osco veteran, became the CEO. In September 1996, Hanson hired Charles "Rick" Weber, another Osco veteran, to be Chief Financial Officer. In December 1999, Lyn Kirby, formerly of Sears Circle of Beauty, became the President and Chief Executive Officer and Weber became Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The two ran the business together until Weber left in September 2006 when he was selected by Tom Stemberg, founder of Staples, to become Chairman and Chief Executive officer of Rec Room Furniture and Games, Inc.[4] On October 25, 2007, the company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ. In 2008, the company opened a second distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona. On April 26, 2010, Ulta announced that Mr. Carl "Chuck" Rubin would be appointed as Chief Operating Officer, President, and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective May 10, 2010. According to public filings, Chuck Rubin earned over $11.1MM in 2010, making him one of the 20 highest paid CEOs in Chicago.[5]




Ulta Beauty, Ann Arbor, Michigan


On June 24, 2013, it was announced that Mary Dillon would be appointed as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2013. Mary Dillon previously held positions as the former chief of U.S. Cellular and senior executive at McDonald's and PepsiCo.[6]
Finances[edit]
Ulta Beauty sales were $713.8 million for the first quarter ending in May 2014.[7] At the end of the second quarter ending in August 2014, Ulta Beauty reported that total sales increased by 22.2 percent and comparable store sales Increased 9.6 percent.[8] Wall Street expected the company's total sales to reach $3.19 billion for the fiscal year ending in February 2015, which would be almost three times the amount of Ulta Beauty's sales levels in 2009.[9]
Locations[edit]
In 2013, Ulta opened 125 stores in the United States, bringing their total number of locations to 675 stores. They also announced plans to open 100 more locations by the end of 2014.[10] As of January 28, 2017, Ulta operates 974 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia.[1] A majority of Ulta Beauty stores are located in the East Coast region, however on the West Coast, California also has a large presence of company-owned stores.[11] Ulta said it aims to have 1,000 stores located in the United States sometime during 2017.[12]
Brands[edit]
Ulta Beauty offers both high-end and drugstore cosmetics, skincare, and fragrances.[13] High-end brands sold at Ulta include bareMinerals, Benefit Cosmetics, Clinique, Smashbox, Stila, Urban Decay, AmazingCosmetics and Tarte. Drugstore brands include Covergirl, L'Oréal, Maybelline, NYX Cosmetics, and Revlon. Ulta Beauty also sells its own brand of makeup, bath and body products, skincare, haircare, nail polish, and fragrances. In May 2017, MAC Cosmetics became available for purchase online,[14] with products scheduled to be in stores beginning in June 2017.[15]
Services[edit]
Ulta has a salon located in every store nationwide. The store format includes a 950 square feet salon area with eight to ten stations. The salon has a concierge desk, skin treatment room, and semi-private shampoo and hair color processing areas. It offers services including hair cuts and hair coloring from Redken-trained hair stylists, skin treatments and facials from Dermalogica trained skin therapists, and manicures from OPI trained professionals.[16]
Benefit Brow Bar[edit]
Ulta Beauty has Benefit Brow Bars located in most stores. Benefit Brow Bar services include brow arching, brow tinting, facial waxing, and eyelash application.[17] The Benefit Brow Bar has become an increasingly popular addition to the Ulta stores as we see an increase in the focus of eyebrows; because of this the Benefit Brow Bar is often excluded from the many promotions held by the company.
Charitable giving[edit]
Starting in 2008, Ulta Beauty's focus in charity giving was The Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Their charitable donations fund research related to the causes, treatment, and possible prevention of breast cancer. By supporting this cause, which benefits women, their families, and their loved ones across the nation, Ulta Beauty seeks to not only bring a greater sense of community amongst women worldwide but also raise awareness about the importance of finding a cure.[18]
Ulta Beauty also hosts programs such as their annual Donate with a Kiss campaign, which raises funds for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation throughout the month of October, Ulta Beauty's Annual Charity Gold Outing, as well as Ulta Beauty's Annual Cut-A-Thon, where customers donate ten dollars to the cause in exchange for a haircut. In 2012, ULTA Beauty raised over 2 million dollars for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[19] In 2014, Ulta Beauty partnered with Ellen DeGeneres during Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October and donated $1.5 million for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[20]
Customer Loyalty Program[edit]
Ulta Beauty's customer loyalty program called Ultamate Rewards allows customers to redeem points for every dollar spent on any in-store or online purchase they make with their membership card.[21]

The Beautiful Journey
Our first store opened its doors in the suburbs of Chicago in 1990. From the beginning, we set out to do beauty differently. We had a vision to create a world of fun and exploration. Over the years, that’s exactly what we’ve done, and along the way we’ve established ourselves a premier beauty destination. With a wide variety of brands to choose from, including everything from the broadly appealing to the niche, across every price point, we brought the best the beauty world had to offer in makeup, fragrance, skincare and haircare, together in one place. And a full-service salon in every store too – revolutionizing the beauty experience for all.
 
Ulta Beauty & You
As a high-growth, fast-paced retailer led by Fortune’s #3 Businessperson of the Year with more than 34,000 associates in 48 states, Ulta Beauty offers rewarding career opportunities at our 990+ retail stores and salons, five distribution centers and corporate office. We are driving industry leading results, leading through a shared set of values, and together becoming the most loved and admired beauty destination.
It’s a great time to be on the fun side of beauty.

History[edit]
Ulta Salon, Cosmetics and Fragrance was founded by Richard E. George, the former President of Osco Drug, Inc. Following his tenure, Terry J. Hanson, another Osco veteran, became the CEO. In September 1996, Hanson hired Charles "Rick" Weber, another Osco veteran, to be Chief Financial Officer. In December 1999, Lyn Kirby, formerly of Sears Circle of Beauty, became the President and Chief Executive Officer and Weber became Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The two ran the business together until Weber left in September 2006 when he was selected by Tom Stemberg, founder of Staples, to become Chairman and Chief Executive officer of Rec Room Furniture and Games, Inc.[4] On October 25, 2007, the company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ. In 2008, the company opened a second distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona. On April 26, 2010, Ulta announced that Mr. Carl "Chuck" Rubin would be appointed as Chief Operating Officer, President, and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective May 10, 2010. According to public filings, Chuck Rubin earned over $11.1MM in 2010, making him one of the 20 highest paid CEOs in Chicago.[5]




Ulta Beauty, Ann Arbor, Michigan


On June 24, 2013, it was announced that Mary Dillon would be appointed as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2013. Mary Dillon previously held positions as the former chief of U.S. Cellular and senior executive at McDonald's and PepsiCo.[6]
Finances[edit]
Ulta Beauty sales were $713.8 million for the first quarter ending in May 2014.[7] At the end of the second quarter ending in August 2014, Ulta Beauty reported that total sales increased by 22.2 percent and comparable store sales Increased 9.6 percent.[8] Wall Street expected the company's total sales to reach $3.19 billion for the fiscal year ending in February 2015, which would be almost three times the amount of Ulta Beauty's sales levels in 2009.[9]
Locations[edit]
In 2013, Ulta opened 125 stores in the United States, bringing their total number of locations to 675 stores. They also announced plans to open 100 more locations by the end of 2014.[10] As of January 28, 2017, Ulta operates 974 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia.[1] A majority of Ulta Beauty stores are located in the East Coast region, however on the West Coast, California also has a large presence of company-owned stores.[11] Ulta said it aims to have 1,000 stores located in the United States sometime during 2017.[12]
Brands[edit]
Ulta Beauty offers both high-end and drugstore cosmetics, skincare, and fragrances.[13] High-end brands sold at Ulta include bareMinerals, Benefit Cosmetics, Clinique, Smashbox, Stila, Urban Decay, AmazingCosmetics and Tarte. Drugstore brands include Covergirl, L'Oréal, Maybelline, NYX Cosmetics, and Revlon. Ulta Beauty also sells its own brand of makeup, bath and body products, skincare, haircare, nail polish, and fragrances. In May 2017, MAC Cosmetics became available for purchase online,[14] with products scheduled to be in stores beginning in June 2017.[15]
Services[edit]
Ulta has a salon located in every store nationwide. The store format includes a 950 square feet salon area with eight to ten stations. The salon has a concierge desk, skin treatment room, and semi-private shampoo and hair color processing areas. It offers services including hair cuts and hair coloring from Redken-trained hair stylists, skin treatments and facials from Dermalogica trained skin therapists, and manicures from OPI trained professionals.[16]
Benefit Brow Bar[edit]
Ulta Beauty has Benefit Brow Bars located in most stores. Benefit Brow Bar services include brow arching, brow tinting, facial waxing, and eyelash application.[17] The Benefit Brow Bar has become an increasingly popular addition to the Ulta stores as we see an increase in the focus of eyebrows; because of this the Benefit Brow Bar is often excluded from the many promotions held by the company.
Charitable giving[edit]
Starting in 2008, Ulta Beauty's focus in charity giving was The Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Their charitable donations fund research related to the causes, treatment, and possible prevention of breast cancer. By supporting this cause, which benefits women, their families, and their loved ones across the nation, Ulta Beauty seeks to not only bring a greater sense of community amongst women worldwide but also raise awareness about the importance of finding a cure.[18]
Ulta Beauty also hosts programs such as their annual Donate with a Kiss campaign, which raises funds for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation throughout the month of October, Ulta Beauty's Annual Charity Gold Outing, as well as Ulta Beauty's Annual Cut-A-Thon, where customers donate ten dollars to the cause in exchange for a haircut. In 2012, ULTA Beauty raised over 2 million dollars for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[19] In 2014, Ulta Beauty partnered with Ellen DeGeneres during Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October and donated $1.5 million for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[20]
Customer Loyalty Program[edit]
Ulta Beauty's customer loyalty program called Ultamate Rewards allows customers to redeem points for every dollar spent on any in-store or online purchase they make with their membership card.[21]

History[edit]
Ulta Salon, Cosmetics and Fragrance was founded by Richard E. George, the former President of Osco Drug, Inc. Following his tenure, Terry J. Hanson, another Osco veteran, became the CEO. In September 1996, Hanson hired Charles "Rick" Weber, another Osco veteran, to be Chief Financial Officer. In December 1999, Lyn Kirby, formerly of Sears Circle of Beauty, became the President and Chief Executive Officer and Weber became Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The two ran the business together until Weber left in September 2006 when he was selected by Tom Stemberg, founder of Staples, to become Chairman and Chief Executive officer of Rec Room Furniture and Games, Inc.[4] On October 25, 2007, the company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ. In 2008, the company opened a second distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona. On April 26, 2010, Ulta announced that Mr. Carl "Chuck" Rubin would be appointed as Chief Operating Officer, President, and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective May 10, 2010. According to public filings, Chuck Rubin earned over $11.1MM in 2010, making him one of the 20 highest paid CEOs in Chicago.[5]




Ulta Beauty, Ann Arbor, Michigan


On June 24, 2013, it was announced that Mary Dillon would be appointed as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2013. Mary Dillon previously held positions as the former chief of U.S. Cellular and senior executive at McDonald's and PepsiCo.[6]
Finances[edit]
Ulta Beauty sales were $713.8 million for the first quarter ending in May 2014.[7] At the end of the second quarter ending in August 2014, Ulta Beauty reported that total sales increased by 22.2 percent and comparable store sales Increased 9.6 percent.[8] Wall Street expected the company's total sales to reach $3.19 billion for the fiscal year ending in February 2015, which would be almost three times the amount of Ulta Beauty's sales levels in 2009.[9]
Locations[edit]
In 2013, Ulta opened 125 stores in the United States, bringing their total number of locations to 675 stores. They also announced plans to open 100 more locations by the end of 2014.[10] As of January 28, 2017, Ulta operates 974 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia.[1] A majority of Ulta Beauty stores are located in the East Coast region, however on the West Coast, California also has a large presence of company-owned stores.[11] Ulta said it aims to have 1,000 stores located in the United States sometime during 2017.[12]
Brands[edit]
Ulta Beauty offers both high-end and drugstore cosmetics, skincare, and fragrances.[13] High-end brands sold at Ulta include bareMinerals, Benefit Cosmetics, Clinique, Smashbox, Stila, Urban Decay, AmazingCosmetics and Tarte. Drugstore brands include Covergirl, L'Oréal, Maybelline, NYX Cosmetics, and Revlon. Ulta Beauty also sells its own brand of makeup, bath and body products, skincare, haircare, nail polish, and fragrances. In May 2017, MAC Cosmetics became available for purchase online,[14] with products scheduled to be in stores beginning in June 2017.[15]
Services[edit]
Ulta has a salon located in every store nationwide. The store format includes a 950 square feet salon area with eight to ten stations. The salon has a concierge desk, skin treatment room, and semi-private shampoo and hair color processing areas. It offers services including hair cuts and hair coloring from Redken-trained hair stylists, skin treatments and facials from Dermalogica trained skin therapists, and manicures from OPI trained professionals.[16]
Benefit Brow Bar[edit]
Ulta Beauty has Benefit Brow Bars located in most stores. Benefit Brow Bar services include brow arching, brow tinting, facial waxing, and eyelash application.[17] The Benefit Brow Bar has become an increasingly popular addition to the Ulta stores as we see an increase in the focus of eyebrows; because of this the Benefit Brow Bar is often excluded from the many promotions held by the company.
Charitable giving[edit]
Starting in 2008, Ulta Beauty's focus in charity giving was The Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Their charitable donations fund research related to the causes, treatment, and possible prevention of breast cancer. By supporting this cause, which benefits women, their families, and their loved ones across the nation, Ulta Beauty seeks to not only bring a greater sense of community amongst women worldwide but also raise awareness about the importance of finding a cure.[18]
Ulta Beauty also hosts programs such as their annual Donate with a Kiss campaign, which raises funds for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation throughout the month of October, Ulta Beauty's Annual Charity Gold Outing, as well as Ulta Beauty's Annual Cut-A-Thon, where customers donate ten dollars to the cause in exchange for a haircut. In 2012, ULTA Beauty raised over 2 million dollars for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[19] In 2014, Ulta Beauty partnered with Ellen DeGeneres during Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October and donated $1.5 million for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[20]
Customer Loyalty Program[edit]
Ulta Beauty's customer loyalty program called Ultamate Rewards allows customers to redeem points for every dollar spent on any in-store or online purchase they make with their membership card.[21]

About ULTA SALON, COSMETICS & FRAGRANCE, INC.

   Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance operates more than 870 beauty stores nationwide. About a third of its locations are in Illinois, Texas, Florida, and California. Ulta stocks more than 20,000 prestige and mass-market products, including cosmetics, fragrances, skin and hair care products, salon styling tools, and accessories. Stores offer hair salon services, as well as manicures, pedicures, massages, waxing, and other beauty treatments. In addition to its brick-and-mortar presence, the company markets more than 20,000 products and more than 500 brand names through its e-commerce site. Ulta was founded in 1990 by Terry Hanson and Dick George.
  
Operations

   The retailer operates its business through one reportable segment. Ulta combined its three operating segments -- retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce -- into one reportable segment, because it determined that each previous segment boasts a similar consumer, economic characteristics, nature of products, and distribution methods.
  

   Ulta's operations are supported by three distribution facilities located in Illinois, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. (A fourth is slated to open in the Dallas area in 2016.) The retailer carries more than 20,000 products and replenishes its stores with less-than-case quantities to allow it to ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a particular product is required. Its distribution facilities use warehouse management and warehouse control software systems, which has been upgraded or installed during the past three years.
  
Geographic Reach

   Ulta operates about 870 stores across 48 states. Illinois, Texas, Florida, and California make up more than a third of its stores network.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The retailer fills its stores with help from some 300 product vendors, which altogether offer more than 500 brands. Its top 10 vendors include the likes of Bare Escentuals, Procter & Gamble, Coty, and L'Oréal.
  
Financial Performance

   Ulta has experienced unprecedented growth over the years, with revenues peaking at $3.92 billion in 2015, a company milestone. The historic growth for 2015 was primarily fueled by a spike in salon service sales due to the opening of 100 net new stores sales during the year.
  

   Profits also surged to a record-setting $320 million in 2015 as a result of the additional revenue coupled with a spike in interest income, resulting from short-term investments with maturities. After steadily growing the last several years, cash flow from operations dipped by 5%, mainly due to changes in working capital in merchandise inventories, due to the opening of the new stores.
  
Strategy

   Ulta's ultimate goal is to grow its US stores network to approximately 1,200 locations. It aims to continue opening stores in markets where it currently operates and in new markets as it tracks its long-term target of 15% to 20% new store growth rates.

History[edit]
Ulta Salon, Cosmetics and Fragrance was founded by Richard E. George, the former President of Osco Drug, Inc. Following his tenure, Terry J. Hanson, another Osco veteran, became the CEO. In September 1996, Hanson hired Charles "Rick" Weber, another Osco veteran, to be Chief Financial Officer. In December 1999, Lyn Kirby, formerly of Sears Circle of Beauty, became the President and Chief Executive Officer and Weber became Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The two ran the business together until Weber left in September 2006 when he was selected by Tom Stemberg, founder of Staples, to become Chairman and Chief Executive officer of Rec Room Furniture and Games, Inc.[4] On October 25, 2007, the company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ. In 2008, the company opened a second distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona. On April 26, 2010, Ulta announced that Mr. Carl "Chuck" Rubin would be appointed as Chief Operating Officer, President, and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective May 10, 2010. According to public filings, Chuck Rubin earned over $11.1MM in 2010, making him one of the 20 highest paid CEOs in Chicago.[5]




Ulta Beauty, Ann Arbor, Michigan


On June 24, 2013, it was announced that Mary Dillon would be appointed as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2013. Mary Dillon previously held positions as the former chief of U.S. Cellular and senior executive at McDonald's and PepsiCo.[6]
Finances[edit]
Ulta Beauty sales were $713.8 million for the first quarter ending in May 2014.[7] At the end of the second quarter ending in August 2014, Ulta Beauty reported that total sales increased by 22.2 percent and comparable store sales Increased 9.6 percent.[8] Wall Street expected the company's total sales to reach $3.19 billion for the fiscal year ending in February 2015, which would be almost three times the amount of Ulta Beauty's sales levels in 2009.[9]
Locations[edit]
In 2013, Ulta opened 125 stores in the United States, bringing their total number of locations to 675 stores. They also announced plans to open 100 more locations by the end of 2014.[10] As of January 28, 2017, Ulta operates 974 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia.[1] A majority of Ulta Beauty stores are located in the East Coast region, however on the West Coast, California also has a large presence of company-owned stores.[11] Ulta said it aims to have 1,000 stores located in the United States sometime during 2017.[12]
Brands[edit]
Ulta Beauty offers both high-end and drugstore cosmetics, skincare, and fragrances.[13] High-end brands sold at Ulta include bareMinerals, Benefit Cosmetics, Clinique, Smashbox, Stila, Urban Decay, AmazingCosmetics and Tarte. Drugstore brands include Covergirl, L'Oréal, Maybelline, NYX Cosmetics, and Revlon. Ulta Beauty also sells its own brand of makeup, bath and body products, skincare, haircare, nail polish, and fragrances. In May 2017, MAC Cosmetics became available for purchase online,[14] with products scheduled to be in stores beginning in June 2017.[15]
Services[edit]
Ulta has a salon located in every store nationwide. The store format includes a 950 square feet salon area with eight to ten stations. The salon has a concierge desk, skin treatment room, and semi-private shampoo and hair color processing areas. It offers services including hair cuts and hair coloring from Redken-trained hair stylists, skin treatments and facials from Dermalogica trained skin therapists, and manicures from OPI trained professionals.[16]
Benefit Brow Bar[edit]
Ulta Beauty has Benefit Brow Bars located in most stores. Benefit Brow Bar services include brow arching, brow tinting, facial waxing, and eyelash application.[17] The Benefit Brow Bar has become an increasingly popular addition to the Ulta stores as we see an increase in the focus of eyebrows; because of this the Benefit Brow Bar is often excluded from the many promotions held by the company.
Charitable giving[edit]
Starting in 2008, Ulta Beauty's focus in charity giving was The Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Their charitable donations fund research related to the causes, treatment, and possible prevention of breast cancer. By supporting this cause, which benefits women, their families, and their loved ones across the nation, Ulta Beauty seeks to not only bring a greater sense of community amongst women worldwide but also raise awareness about the importance of finding a cure.[18]
Ulta Beauty also hosts programs such as their annual Donate with a Kiss campaign, which raises funds for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation throughout the month of October, Ulta Beauty's Annual Charity Gold Outing, as well as Ulta Beauty's Annual Cut-A-Thon, where customers donate ten dollars to the cause in exchange for a haircut. In 2012, ULTA Beauty raised over 2 million dollars for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[19] In 2014, Ulta Beauty partnered with Ellen DeGeneres during Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October and donated $1.5 million for The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.[20]
Customer Loyalty Program[edit]
Ulta Beauty's customer loyalty program called Ultamate Rewards allows customers to redeem points for every dollar spent on any in-store or online purchase they make with their membership card.[21]
