The Home Savings and Loan Company, a subsidiary of United Community Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: UCFC), is a full-service community bank headquartered in Youngstown, Ohio.
Founded in 1889, Home Savings has always maintained a commitment to developing long-standing relationships with local residents and businesses by providing its customers a full range of retail and commercial banking products and service that exceed expectations.
One of Home Savings' greatest strengths continues to be its level of community involvement, evidenced by its strong presence in a variety of service organizations, charitable causes and public efforts. Home Savings employees are encouraged to become active members of civic groups, economic development programs, educational projects and urban revitalization efforts.
In 1998, Home Savings underwent a mutual-to-stock conversion to form its holding company, United Community Financial Corp., enabling opportunities for further corporate growth and product diversity. At the same time, the Home Savings Charitable Foundation was formed to further strengthen its positive impact within the community. The Foundation focuses contributions in the areas of education, health care and disadvantaged children and adults, and since its inception, has contributed over $12 million dollars to non-profit organizations throughout Home Savings' market areas.
With assets of $1.9 billion, Home Savings currently operates 31 retail banking offices and 12 loan production centers throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia with approximately 500 employees.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
