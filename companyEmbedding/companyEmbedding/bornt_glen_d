FIVE POINTS, Calif., Nov. 29, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- S&W Seed Company (Nasdaq:   SANW), today announced that it has nominated Glen D. Bornt to its Board of Directors as part of the slate of nominees proposed for election at the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders, scheduled for December 8, 2012 in Reno, Nevada.
Since 1987, Glen Bornt has been the president of Imperial Valley Milling Co., where he serves as Chief Executive Officer and on-site manager. Imperial Valley Milling, established in Holtville in 1921, is a recognized leader in contracting for and producing alfalfa seed in the Imperial Valley of California. Since September 2007 and until its October 1, 2012 acquisition by S&W, Mr. Bornt also served as Vice President of Imperial Valley Seeds, Inc., the international marketing arm of Imperial Valley Milling. At the age of 26, Glen Bornt took control of the Holtville based Imperial Valley Milling, and built it into a major force in the non-dormant alfalfa industry. With S&W's acquisition of Imperial Valley Seed, headed by S&W's vice president, Fred Fabre, S&W now has the rights to substantially all of Imperial Valley Milling's alfalfa seed production. Mr. Bornt is a lifetime resident of the Imperial Valley and holds a BS degree in Agriculture Management from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. 
Grover Wickersham, chairman of the Board of Directors of S&W Seed Company, commented, "Because of S&W's close business relationship with Imperial Valley Milling, we know Glen very well. We are extremely pleased that he is joining our board. Glen brings 25 years of experience in working with Imperial Valley farmers to produce and process alfalfa seed. He will bring valuable knowledge to our boardroom as we continue to grow our seed business. We look forward to benefitting from Glen's leadership in the coming years."
Mr. Bornt commented, "I am looking forward to contributing as an S&W board member. I believe that my years in alfalfa seed farming, seed processing and sales will be valuable at S&W. I also look forward to assisting S&W to become more involved in Australian alfalfa seed production, since I am based half-time in Australian farm country."
About S&W Seed CompanyFounded in 1980 and headquartered in the Central Valley of California, S&W Seed Company is a leading producer of warm climate, high yield alfalfa seed varieties, including varieties that can thrive in poor, saline soils, as verified over decades of university-sponsored trials. S&W Seed also offers seed cleaning and processing at its 40-acre facility in Five Points, California and, in 2011, began the commercial launch of its California-based stevia leaf business in response to the growing global demand for the all-natural, zero calorie sweetener from the food and beverage industry.
