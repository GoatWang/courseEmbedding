Michael D Ross's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Ball Memorial Hospital
Job Details
               The elective program at Ball Hospital provides experience in all internal medicine subspecialties and related surgical subspecialties. Residents in pursuit of subspecialty fellowship training are successful in finding positions at outstanding institutions. Residents are involved with research and scholarly activity. Residents must complete a one month Research rotation during the PGY-2 year, with emphasis on writing and presentation skills, epidemiology, manuscript preparation, and biostatistics. Residents are encouraged to join clinical research trials and must complete a scholarly project suitable for journal publication prior to graduation. Additional research experience is available to interested residents. The ambulatory experience is broad. The Internal Medicine Clinic, under the direction of Dr. Brandon Dickey, provides a three-year longitudinal continuity experience for management of ambulatory patients. Additional experiences in outpatient orthopedics, ophthalmology, rheumatology, and gynecology are obtained in the Multidisciplinary Ambulatory Experience in each year of training. Experience in a community general internist's office is also obtained during these block rotations. A two-week outpatient rotation in the third year emphasizes adolescent medicine at the Ball State University Student Health Center. We also have added a one-month experience in Sports & Occupational Medicine. The Internal Medicine Residency has a large number of institutionally-based faculty members. The primary ward medicine experience is supervised by hospital-based general internists with a strong commitment to teaching. Integration of the Hospitalist Service with Medical Education has created a large faculty base to enhance residents' supervision and education. A large number of faculty members have received training at institutions other than Indiana University, including Duke University, The University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern University, The University of Cincinnati, and the University of Utah. An extensive visiting professor program supplements our local faculty. Our residents strive for academic excellence. Our residents have won the Indiana ACP Chapter's "Doctor's Dilemma" academic competition four of the last seven years (including 2008) and competed in the national championship three years in a row. Our residents and faculty publish many articles in peer-reviewed journals and regularly present posters and abstracts at regional and national meetings. Dr. Romero, one of our past Chief Residents, presented a poster at the ACP national meeting in Washington two years ago. Full accreditation by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) virtually guarantees that each resident will develop proficiency in the diagnosis and treatment of adult medical problems. There is ample opportunity for the residents to earn additional income. In-house moonlighting and teaching of sophomore medical students at the Indiana University School of Medicine-Muncie are examples. The residency will cover malpractice insurance for approved off-site moonlighting activities.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Ross, Michael D carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Ross, Michael D currently holds license 47414 (Hvac A/C Technician (Certified)), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Ross, Michael D



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Ross, Michael D



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Ross, Michael D



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).
