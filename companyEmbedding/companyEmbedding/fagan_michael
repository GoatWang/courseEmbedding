Fagan inspection - Wikipedia





















 






Fagan inspection

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search






This article includes a list of references, but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations. Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations. (October 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)







It has been suggested that this article be merged into Software inspection. (Discuss) Proposed since January 2015.


A Fagan inspection is a structured process of trying to find defects in development documents such as programming code, specifications, designs and others during various phases of the software development process. It is named after Michael Fagan, who is credited with being the inventor of formal software inspections.
Fagan Inspection defines a process as a certain activity with a pre-specified entry and exit criteria. In every activity or operation for which entry and exit criteria are specified Fagan Inspections can be used to validate if the output of the process complies with the exit criteria specified for the process. Fagan Inspection uses a group review method to evaluate the output of a given process.

Examples[edit]
Examples of activities for which Fagan Inspection can be used are:

Requirement specification
Software/Information System architecture (for example DYA)
Programming (for example for iterations in XP or DSDM)
Software testing (for example when creating test scripts)

Usage[edit]
The software development process is a typical application of Fagan Inspection; software development process is a series of operations which will deliver a certain end product and consists of operations like requirements definition, design, coding up to testing and maintenance. As the costs to remedy a defect are up to 10-100 times less in the early operations compared to fixing a defect in the maintenance phase[citation needed] it is essential to find defects as close to the point of insertion as possible. This is done by inspecting the output of each operation and comparing that to the output requirements, or exit-criteria of that operation.
Criteria[edit]
Entry criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to enter a specific process.[1] For example, for Fagan inspections the high- and low-level documents must comply with specific entry-criteria before they can be used for a formal inspection process.
Exit criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to complete a specific process. For example, for Fagan inspections the low-level document must comply with specific exit-criteria (as specified in the high-level document) before the development process can be taken to the next phase.
The exit-criteria are specified in a high-level document, which is then used as the standard to compare the operation result (low-level document) to during the inspections. Deviations of the low-level document from the requirements specified in the high-level document are called defects and can be categorized in Major Defects and Minor Defects.
Defects[edit]
According to M.E. Fagan, “A defect is an instance in which a requirement is not satisfied.”[1]
In the process of software inspection the defects which are found are categorized in two categories: major and minor defects (often many more categories are used). The defects which are statements or declarations that are incorrect, or even missing information can be classified as major defects: the software will not function correctly when these defects are not being solved.
In contrast to major defects, minor defects do not threaten the correct functioning of the software, but are mostly small errors like spelling mistakes in documents or optical issues like incorrect positioning of controls in a program interface.
Typical operations[edit]
In a typical Fagan inspection the inspection process consists of the following operations:[1]

Planning

Preparation of materials
Arranging of participants
Arranging of meeting place


Overview

Group education of participants on the materials under review
Assignment of roles


Preparation

The participants review the item to be inspected and supporting material to prepare for the meeting noting any questions or possible defects
The participants prepare their roles


Inspection meeting

Actual finding of defect


Rework 

Rework is the step in software inspection in which the defects found during the inspection meeting are resolved by the author, designer or programmer. On the basis of the list of defects the low-level document is corrected until the requirements in the high-level document are met.


Follow-up 

In the follow-up phase of software inspections all defects found in the inspection meeting should be corrected (as they have been fixed in the rework phase). The moderator is responsible for verifying that this is indeed the case. He should verify if all defects are fixed and no new defects are inserted while trying to fix the initial defects. It is crucial that all defects are corrected as the costs of fixing them in a later phase of the project will be 10 to 100 times higher compared to the current costs.






Fagan inspection basic model



Follow-up[edit]
In the follow-up phase of a Fagan Inspection, defects fixed in the rework phase should be verified. The moderator is usually responsible for verifying rework. Sometimes fixed work can be accepted without being verified, such as when the defect was trivial. In non-trivial cases, a full re-inspection is performed by the inspection team (not only the moderator).
If verification fails, go back to the rework process.
Roles[edit]
The participants of the inspection process are normally just members of the team that is performing the project. The participants fulfill different roles within the inspection process:[2][3]

Author/Designer/Coder: the person who wrote the low-level document
Reader: paraphrases the document
Reviewers: reviews the document from a testing standpoint
Moderator: responsible for the inspection session, functions as a coach

Benefits and results[edit]
By using inspections the number of errors in the final product can significantly decrease, creating a higher quality product. In the future the team will even be able to avoid errors as the inspection sessions give them insight in the most frequently made errors in both design and coding providing avoidance of error at the root of their occurrence. By continuously improving the inspection process these insights can even further be used [1][Fagan, 1986].
Together with the qualitative benefits mentioned above major "cost improvements" can be reached as the avoidance and earlier detection of errors will reduce the amount of resources needed for debugging in later phases of the project.
In practice very positive results have been reported by large corporations like IBM indicating that 80-90% of defects can be found and savings in resources up to 25% can be reached [1][Fagan, 1986].
Improvements[edit]
Although the Fagan Inspection method has been proved to be very effective, improvements have been suggested by multiple researchers. Genuchten for example has been researching the usage of an Electronic Meeting System (EMS) to improve the productivity of the meetings with positive results [4] [Genuchten, 1997].
Other researchers propose the usage of software that keeps a database of detected errors and automatically scans program code for these common errors [5] [Doolan,1992]. This again should result in improved productivity.
Example[edit]
In the diagram a very simple example is given of an inspection process in which a two-line piece of code is inspected on the basis on a high-level document with a single requirement.
As can be seen in the high-level document for this project is specified that in all software code produced variables should be declared ‘strong typed’. On the basis of this requirement the low-level document is checked for defects. Unfortunately a defect is found on line 1, as a variable is not declared ‘strong typed’. The defect found is then reported in the list of defects found and categorized according to the categorizations specified in the high-level document.

A Fagan inspection is a structured process of trying to find defects in development documents such as programming code, specifications, designs and others during various phases of the software development process. It is named after Michael Fagan, who is credited with being the inventor of formal software inspections.
Fagan Inspection defines a process as a certain activity with a pre-specified entry and exit criteria. In every activity or operation for which entry and exit criteria are specified Fagan Inspections can be used to validate if the output of the process complies with the exit criteria specified for the process. Fagan Inspection uses a group review method to evaluate the output of a given process.

Examples[edit]
Examples of activities for which Fagan Inspection can be used are:

Requirement specification
Software/Information System architecture (for example DYA)
Programming (for example for iterations in XP or DSDM)
Software testing (for example when creating test scripts)

Usage[edit]
The software development process is a typical application of Fagan Inspection; software development process is a series of operations which will deliver a certain end product and consists of operations like requirements definition, design, coding up to testing and maintenance. As the costs to remedy a defect are up to 10-100 times less in the early operations compared to fixing a defect in the maintenance phase[citation needed] it is essential to find defects as close to the point of insertion as possible. This is done by inspecting the output of each operation and comparing that to the output requirements, or exit-criteria of that operation.
Criteria[edit]
Entry criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to enter a specific process.[1] For example, for Fagan inspections the high- and low-level documents must comply with specific entry-criteria before they can be used for a formal inspection process.
Exit criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to complete a specific process. For example, for Fagan inspections the low-level document must comply with specific exit-criteria (as specified in the high-level document) before the development process can be taken to the next phase.
The exit-criteria are specified in a high-level document, which is then used as the standard to compare the operation result (low-level document) to during the inspections. Deviations of the low-level document from the requirements specified in the high-level document are called defects and can be categorized in Major Defects and Minor Defects.
Defects[edit]
According to M.E. Fagan, “A defect is an instance in which a requirement is not satisfied.”[1]
In the process of software inspection the defects which are found are categorized in two categories: major and minor defects (often many more categories are used). The defects which are statements or declarations that are incorrect, or even missing information can be classified as major defects: the software will not function correctly when these defects are not being solved.
In contrast to major defects, minor defects do not threaten the correct functioning of the software, but are mostly small errors like spelling mistakes in documents or optical issues like incorrect positioning of controls in a program interface.
Typical operations[edit]
In a typical Fagan inspection the inspection process consists of the following operations:[1]

Planning

Preparation of materials
Arranging of participants
Arranging of meeting place


Overview

Group education of participants on the materials under review
Assignment of roles


Preparation

The participants review the item to be inspected and supporting material to prepare for the meeting noting any questions or possible defects
The participants prepare their roles


Inspection meeting

Actual finding of defect


Rework 

Rework is the step in software inspection in which the defects found during the inspection meeting are resolved by the author, designer or programmer. On the basis of the list of defects the low-level document is corrected until the requirements in the high-level document are met.


Follow-up 

In the follow-up phase of software inspections all defects found in the inspection meeting should be corrected (as they have been fixed in the rework phase). The moderator is responsible for verifying that this is indeed the case. He should verify if all defects are fixed and no new defects are inserted while trying to fix the initial defects. It is crucial that all defects are corrected as the costs of fixing them in a later phase of the project will be 10 to 100 times higher compared to the current costs.






Fagan inspection basic model



Follow-up[edit]
In the follow-up phase of a Fagan Inspection, defects fixed in the rework phase should be verified. The moderator is usually responsible for verifying rework. Sometimes fixed work can be accepted without being verified, such as when the defect was trivial. In non-trivial cases, a full re-inspection is performed by the inspection team (not only the moderator).
If verification fails, go back to the rework process.
Roles[edit]
The participants of the inspection process are normally just members of the team that is performing the project. The participants fulfill different roles within the inspection process:[2][3]

Author/Designer/Coder: the person who wrote the low-level document
Reader: paraphrases the document
Reviewers: reviews the document from a testing standpoint
Moderator: responsible for the inspection session, functions as a coach

Benefits and results[edit]
By using inspections the number of errors in the final product can significantly decrease, creating a higher quality product. In the future the team will even be able to avoid errors as the inspection sessions give them insight in the most frequently made errors in both design and coding providing avoidance of error at the root of their occurrence. By continuously improving the inspection process these insights can even further be used [1][Fagan, 1986].
Together with the qualitative benefits mentioned above major "cost improvements" can be reached as the avoidance and earlier detection of errors will reduce the amount of resources needed for debugging in later phases of the project.
In practice very positive results have been reported by large corporations like IBM indicating that 80-90% of defects can be found and savings in resources up to 25% can be reached [1][Fagan, 1986].
Improvements[edit]
Although the Fagan Inspection method has been proved to be very effective, improvements have been suggested by multiple researchers. Genuchten for example has been researching the usage of an Electronic Meeting System (EMS) to improve the productivity of the meetings with positive results [4] [Genuchten, 1997].
Other researchers propose the usage of software that keeps a database of detected errors and automatically scans program code for these common errors [5] [Doolan,1992]. This again should result in improved productivity.
Example[edit]
In the diagram a very simple example is given of an inspection process in which a two-line piece of code is inspected on the basis on a high-level document with a single requirement.
As can be seen in the high-level document for this project is specified that in all software code produced variables should be declared ‘strong typed’. On the basis of this requirement the low-level document is checked for defects. Unfortunately a defect is found on line 1, as a variable is not declared ‘strong typed’. The defect found is then reported in the list of defects found and categorized according to the categorizations specified in the high-level document.

Examples of activities for which Fagan Inspection can be used are:

Requirement specification
Software/Information System architecture (for example DYA)
Programming (for example for iterations in XP or DSDM)
Software testing (for example when creating test scripts)

Usage[edit]
The software development process is a typical application of Fagan Inspection; software development process is a series of operations which will deliver a certain end product and consists of operations like requirements definition, design, coding up to testing and maintenance. As the costs to remedy a defect are up to 10-100 times less in the early operations compared to fixing a defect in the maintenance phase[citation needed] it is essential to find defects as close to the point of insertion as possible. This is done by inspecting the output of each operation and comparing that to the output requirements, or exit-criteria of that operation.
Criteria[edit]
Entry criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to enter a specific process.[1] For example, for Fagan inspections the high- and low-level documents must comply with specific entry-criteria before they can be used for a formal inspection process.
Exit criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to complete a specific process. For example, for Fagan inspections the low-level document must comply with specific exit-criteria (as specified in the high-level document) before the development process can be taken to the next phase.
The exit-criteria are specified in a high-level document, which is then used as the standard to compare the operation result (low-level document) to during the inspections. Deviations of the low-level document from the requirements specified in the high-level document are called defects and can be categorized in Major Defects and Minor Defects.
Defects[edit]
According to M.E. Fagan, “A defect is an instance in which a requirement is not satisfied.”[1]
In the process of software inspection the defects which are found are categorized in two categories: major and minor defects (often many more categories are used). The defects which are statements or declarations that are incorrect, or even missing information can be classified as major defects: the software will not function correctly when these defects are not being solved.
In contrast to major defects, minor defects do not threaten the correct functioning of the software, but are mostly small errors like spelling mistakes in documents or optical issues like incorrect positioning of controls in a program interface.

A Fagan inspection is a structured process of trying to find defects in development documents such as programming code, specifications, designs and others during various phases of the software development process. It is named after Michael Fagan, who is credited with being the inventor of formal software inspections.
Fagan Inspection defines a process as a certain activity with a pre-specified entry and exit criteria. In every activity or operation for which entry and exit criteria are specified Fagan Inspections can be used to validate if the output of the process complies with the exit criteria specified for the process. Fagan Inspection uses a group review method to evaluate the output of a given process.

Examples[edit]
Examples of activities for which Fagan Inspection can be used are:

Requirement specification
Software/Information System architecture (for example DYA)
Programming (for example for iterations in XP or DSDM)
Software testing (for example when creating test scripts)

Usage[edit]
The software development process is a typical application of Fagan Inspection; software development process is a series of operations which will deliver a certain end product and consists of operations like requirements definition, design, coding up to testing and maintenance. As the costs to remedy a defect are up to 10-100 times less in the early operations compared to fixing a defect in the maintenance phase[citation needed] it is essential to find defects as close to the point of insertion as possible. This is done by inspecting the output of each operation and comparing that to the output requirements, or exit-criteria of that operation.
Criteria[edit]
Entry criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to enter a specific process.[1] For example, for Fagan inspections the high- and low-level documents must comply with specific entry-criteria before they can be used for a formal inspection process.
Exit criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to complete a specific process. For example, for Fagan inspections the low-level document must comply with specific exit-criteria (as specified in the high-level document) before the development process can be taken to the next phase.
The exit-criteria are specified in a high-level document, which is then used as the standard to compare the operation result (low-level document) to during the inspections. Deviations of the low-level document from the requirements specified in the high-level document are called defects and can be categorized in Major Defects and Minor Defects.
Defects[edit]
According to M.E. Fagan, “A defect is an instance in which a requirement is not satisfied.”[1]
In the process of software inspection the defects which are found are categorized in two categories: major and minor defects (often many more categories are used). The defects which are statements or declarations that are incorrect, or even missing information can be classified as major defects: the software will not function correctly when these defects are not being solved.
In contrast to major defects, minor defects do not threaten the correct functioning of the software, but are mostly small errors like spelling mistakes in documents or optical issues like incorrect positioning of controls in a program interface.
Typical operations[edit]
In a typical Fagan inspection the inspection process consists of the following operations:[1]

Planning

Preparation of materials
Arranging of participants
Arranging of meeting place


Overview

Group education of participants on the materials under review
Assignment of roles


Preparation

The participants review the item to be inspected and supporting material to prepare for the meeting noting any questions or possible defects
The participants prepare their roles


Inspection meeting

Actual finding of defect


Rework 

Rework is the step in software inspection in which the defects found during the inspection meeting are resolved by the author, designer or programmer. On the basis of the list of defects the low-level document is corrected until the requirements in the high-level document are met.


Follow-up 

In the follow-up phase of software inspections all defects found in the inspection meeting should be corrected (as they have been fixed in the rework phase). The moderator is responsible for verifying that this is indeed the case. He should verify if all defects are fixed and no new defects are inserted while trying to fix the initial defects. It is crucial that all defects are corrected as the costs of fixing them in a later phase of the project will be 10 to 100 times higher compared to the current costs.






Fagan inspection basic model



Follow-up[edit]
In the follow-up phase of a Fagan Inspection, defects fixed in the rework phase should be verified. The moderator is usually responsible for verifying rework. Sometimes fixed work can be accepted without being verified, such as when the defect was trivial. In non-trivial cases, a full re-inspection is performed by the inspection team (not only the moderator).
If verification fails, go back to the rework process.
Roles[edit]
The participants of the inspection process are normally just members of the team that is performing the project. The participants fulfill different roles within the inspection process:[2][3]

Author/Designer/Coder: the person who wrote the low-level document
Reader: paraphrases the document
Reviewers: reviews the document from a testing standpoint
Moderator: responsible for the inspection session, functions as a coach

Benefits and results[edit]
By using inspections the number of errors in the final product can significantly decrease, creating a higher quality product. In the future the team will even be able to avoid errors as the inspection sessions give them insight in the most frequently made errors in both design and coding providing avoidance of error at the root of their occurrence. By continuously improving the inspection process these insights can even further be used [1][Fagan, 1986].
Together with the qualitative benefits mentioned above major "cost improvements" can be reached as the avoidance and earlier detection of errors will reduce the amount of resources needed for debugging in later phases of the project.
In practice very positive results have been reported by large corporations like IBM indicating that 80-90% of defects can be found and savings in resources up to 25% can be reached [1][Fagan, 1986].
Improvements[edit]
Although the Fagan Inspection method has been proved to be very effective, improvements have been suggested by multiple researchers. Genuchten for example has been researching the usage of an Electronic Meeting System (EMS) to improve the productivity of the meetings with positive results [4] [Genuchten, 1997].
Other researchers propose the usage of software that keeps a database of detected errors and automatically scans program code for these common errors [5] [Doolan,1992]. This again should result in improved productivity.
Example[edit]
In the diagram a very simple example is given of an inspection process in which a two-line piece of code is inspected on the basis on a high-level document with a single requirement.
As can be seen in the high-level document for this project is specified that in all software code produced variables should be declared ‘strong typed’. On the basis of this requirement the low-level document is checked for defects. Unfortunately a defect is found on line 1, as a variable is not declared ‘strong typed’. The defect found is then reported in the list of defects found and categorized according to the categorizations specified in the high-level document.

Usage[edit]
The software development process is a typical application of Fagan Inspection; software development process is a series of operations which will deliver a certain end product and consists of operations like requirements definition, design, coding up to testing and maintenance. As the costs to remedy a defect are up to 10-100 times less in the early operations compared to fixing a defect in the maintenance phase[citation needed] it is essential to find defects as close to the point of insertion as possible. This is done by inspecting the output of each operation and comparing that to the output requirements, or exit-criteria of that operation.
Criteria[edit]
Entry criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to enter a specific process.[1] For example, for Fagan inspections the high- and low-level documents must comply with specific entry-criteria before they can be used for a formal inspection process.
Exit criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to complete a specific process. For example, for Fagan inspections the low-level document must comply with specific exit-criteria (as specified in the high-level document) before the development process can be taken to the next phase.
The exit-criteria are specified in a high-level document, which is then used as the standard to compare the operation result (low-level document) to during the inspections. Deviations of the low-level document from the requirements specified in the high-level document are called defects and can be categorized in Major Defects and Minor Defects.

Michael Fagan is founder and CEO of Michael Fagan Associates and the creator of Fagan Inspections and the Fagan Defect-Free Process™. 
View a recent interview with Michael Fagan.
As a product development manager at IBM, Michael created the Fagan Inspection Process for use on his own projects. Over the years, this has been enhanced and expanded into the the Fagan Defect-Free Process™, incorporating Formal Process Definition, and reinforcing the Continuous Process Improvement aspect of the Inspection Process. 
Using the inspection method, he was also able to use its metrics to monitor projects and keep them on track.   The methodology developed by Michael Fagan is credited with dramatically reducing the number of defects in software and hardware products, increasing the feature content per release, shortening cycle time, increasing customer satisfaction, improving development processes, accelerating SEI/CMM maturity in organizations, and significantly reducing costs. 
Michael Fagan has 20 years of experience at IBM as a line manager of software development, engineering development, and manufacturing. In addition, he was: manager of programming methodology for IBM's DP Product Group (Worldwide); the first software senior technical staff member in IBM's T.J. Watson Research Laboratory; a member of the Corporate Technology Staff; and one of the founder members of the IBM Quality Institute. 
IBM awarded Michael Fagan the largest individual Corporate Achievement Award for creating the Fagan Inspection and promoting its implementation in IBM's laboratories around the world and in industry.

Based upon his research and development of methods that shorten cycle time, reduce cost, and improve quality, he has established an international reputation. Due to these accomplishments, he has been an invited speaker at many national and international conferences on software engineering and management. 
Previously, Michael Fagan was a Visiting Professor in the Department of Computer Science and a member of the Graduate Council of the University of Maryland.
Our Associates have used the same principles they teach in their own work experience as  software and/or hardware engineers and middle to upper level managers of development organizations. They handle both technical and management issues as they arise in the class and have also been specially trained by Michael Fagan to teach the Fagan Defect-Free Process. 
Michael Fagan Associates was formed in 1989 to teach others how to use this method successfully. We continue to refine our methodology and maximize its efficiency. 
Our training course is capable of introducing a rapid and lasting implementation in all types of organizations, producing impressive results in the product or release on which they were working starting the day after training was completed. 
Client products  include systems programs, applications, data base programs, applications, hardware designs, systems and applications requirements and object oriented tools.

Michael Fagan is founder and CEO of Michael Fagan Associates and the creator of Fagan Inspections and the Fagan Defect-Free Process™. 
View a recent interview with Michael Fagan.
As a product development manager at IBM, Michael created the Fagan Inspection Process for use on his own projects. Over the years, this has been enhanced and expanded into the the Fagan Defect-Free Process™, incorporating Formal Process Definition, and reinforcing the Continuous Process Improvement aspect of the Inspection Process. 
Using the inspection method, he was also able to use its metrics to monitor projects and keep them on track.   The methodology developed by Michael Fagan is credited with dramatically reducing the number of defects in software and hardware products, increasing the feature content per release, shortening cycle time, increasing customer satisfaction, improving development processes, accelerating SEI/CMM maturity in organizations, and significantly reducing costs. 
Michael Fagan has 20 years of experience at IBM as a line manager of software development, engineering development, and manufacturing. In addition, he was: manager of programming methodology for IBM's DP Product Group (Worldwide); the first software senior technical staff member in IBM's T.J. Watson Research Laboratory; a member of the Corporate Technology Staff; and one of the founder members of the IBM Quality Institute. 
IBM awarded Michael Fagan the largest individual Corporate Achievement Award for creating the Fagan Inspection and promoting its implementation in IBM's laboratories around the world and in industry.

Based upon his research and development of methods that shorten cycle time, reduce cost, and improve quality, he has established an international reputation. Due to these accomplishments, he has been an invited speaker at many national and international conferences on software engineering and management. 
Previously, Michael Fagan was a Visiting Professor in the Department of Computer Science and a member of the Graduate Council of the University of Maryland.
Our Associates have used the same principles they teach in their own work experience as  software and/or hardware engineers and middle to upper level managers of development organizations. They handle both technical and management issues as they arise in the class and have also been specially trained by Michael Fagan to teach the Fagan Defect-Free Process. 
Michael Fagan Associates was formed in 1989 to teach others how to use this method successfully. We continue to refine our methodology and maximize its efficiency. 
Our training course is capable of introducing a rapid and lasting implementation in all types of organizations, producing impressive results in the product or release on which they were working starting the day after training was completed. 
Client products  include systems programs, applications, data base programs, applications, hardware designs, systems and applications requirements and object oriented tools.
