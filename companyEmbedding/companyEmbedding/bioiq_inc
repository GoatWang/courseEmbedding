From Challenge to Change: The Birth of BioIQ
A medical challenge became a turning point for BioIQ’s founders—and an impetus to change the U.S. healthcare system.
 
 
 
 



Our Story
2005 started out well for Justin Bellante. As a doctoral student at the University of California, he was well on his way to a promising career in materials science. But everything changed in an instant when one of his friends and academic mentors suffered a fatal stroke as the result of an undiagnosed diabetic condition.
“Most of us passively assume that the health care system is going to take care of us,” Bellante recalls. “Yet how could a man who epitomized knowledge and insight be unaware of something so critical? And how can this happen to so many people every day without the underlying conditions being fundamentally addressed?”
BioIQ was founded to help people understand their health in a quantifiable way. As Bellante later learned, his mentor may have been saved by a simple A1c or blood glucose test, which almost certainly would have revealed his risk for contracting this devastating disease. Armed with that knowledge, a routine regimen of diet, exercise, or insulin injections could have helped prevent the stroke that ended his life.


“We realized that there was a fundamental disconnect between the healthcare system and the people needing care,” recalls Bellante. “All the nodes were there —the diagnostic technology, the medical specialists, the methods for presenting information— but no one had taken a systems-level approach to putting it all together.”

Bellante and other members of the founding team were well versed in engineering and quantum mechanics, a science that deals with logical connections among subatomic systems.
Could their knowledge be applied to one of the other most complex systems of all—the U.S. health care system? They envisioned a home-testing service that would enable people to detect critical diseases through regular screening—often before symptoms occur. Personal lab results would be presented through secure health dashboards, along with targeted information to understand health results and take action. Just as your IQ is a measure of general intelligence, your BioIQ would be a way to measure your health.
At the time, most healthcare organizations were focused on the short-term challenge of cutting costs, leaving little time to confront the greater challenge of helping their member populations develop a proactive mindset about their health.
Employers were also just beginning to provide wellness resources to their employees, but little was done to first understand population health needs, or to measure the effectiveness of wellness efforts on population health.
The BioIQ team yearned to start a company that took an engineering approach to healthcare, measuring success not just in revenue earned, but also in population health improvement and number of lives saved. Research revealed that nearly half of the U.S. population was at risk for developing a serious health condition that could be prevented if detected early.
Since those early years, BioIQ has gained traction in the wellness industry by connecting people and populations with solutions to measure their risk for diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Today the company’s valuable intellectual property lies in the technology platform that automates these activities. This platform has become a central hub for securely exchanging electronic health records among employers, health plans, laboratory networks, physicians, hospitals, retail pharmacies, home health care providers, and accountable care organizations (ACOs).
“BioIQ has proven its ability to connect people and populations with solutions to measure vital health metrics and securely exchange wellness data,” says Bellante. “We have helped thousands of organizations and millions of people take a more proactive role in achieving their optimal health.”

Success Stories Scripps
  







Industry Focus: Health Care
Featured Organization: Scripps Health
 
Best Practices in Corporate Wellness
As San Diego’s premier health care provider, Scripps is a community-based health care system with a proud legacy of providing excellent care for the people of San Diego. Scripps brings this same attitude of concern to its own 13,445 employees, as evidenced by its comprehensive wellness program. For the last three years that program has featured biometric screening from BioIQ and its partner, Alere.
Scripps encourages its employees to check their biometric numbers annually as an important step to monitoring their risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and other serious conditions. Participants can either visit one of several onsite clinics where a licensed health care practitioner takes a small blood sample, or they can sign up for the At-Home option to have a BioIQ test kit shipped to their home.
Each BioIQ kit includes instructions for drawing a tiny blood sample through a simple finger-prick method and mailing it to a certified laboratory for analysis. Measurements include High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, and Hemoglobin/ A1c. Participants receive confidential lab reports that present their test results and explain their significance.

“The At-Home option helped us reach our goal of 50% participation rates. BioIQ makes it easier for employees to obtain their vital biometrics.”
— Hamilton Mears, Manager of Corporate Wellness & Health Promotion, Scripps Health
Participants sign a consent form if they want to have their biometric data shared with a health coach. All data is transferred in compliance with HIPAA and Scripps Health policies. Scripps Health never sees personal identifiable health information. Rather it is used to provide customized care options for each participant.
“Scripps goal is to achieve participation rates of 50 percent,” says Hamilton Mears, who manages the corporate wellness program at Scripps Health. “The home testing program has helped us reach this goal. BioIQ makes it easier for employees to obtain their vital biometrics.”
Mears interfaced with wellness experts all over the country to formulate the Scripps Wellness program, including physicians and health experts at thirty hospitals such as the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University. Employees learned about the screening program during monthly wellness seminars, through posters at the workplace, and from a video posted on the Scripps Wellness portal.

“Patients who participate in biometric screening programs bring valuable data to their office visits in the form of lab reports and health assessments.”
— Dr. Jeffrey Sandler, a Scripps-affiliated physician
Actionable Results for Patient and Physician
Tiffany Buchannon opted for the At-Home option. With a history of high cholesterol in her family and years of regulating elevated levels herself, she knows that screening, prevention and careful monitoring are the keys to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. “Having an at-home testing option is a great alternative for people who can’t make it to the onsite screenings,” she notes. “BioIQ offers valuable information for people who are trying to change their lifestyles.”
Melba Nelson, an R.N. at Scripps Health, was one of the early adopters of the biometric screening program. As a big advocate of preventive health and a regular participant in the Scripps Wellness Program, Nelson ordered the BioIQ kit through a simple online signup process. BioIQ shipped her a kit that included a complete cholesterol panel and an A1c test, which measures blood glucose levels over the previous 90 days. A1c test results can indicate an individual’s risk for diabetes and also be used as a monitoring tool for diabetic patients. Cholesterol levels are an important indicator of an individual’s risk for heart disease.
Nelson says she had no trouble obtaining a few drops of blood by pricking her finger with the small, spring-loaded device that came with the BioIQ kit. “I did exactly what the directions said,” she recalls. “It wasn’t painful to me, and the slight discomfort of nicking my finger passed in a few seconds.”
She appreciates the privacy and convenience of monitoring her A1c levels at home, especially at times when she won’t be seeing her doctor or is too busy to visit a lab. “Having my blood drawn at a lab is time consuming,” she adds. “Doing the test at home is a lot easier.”
BioIQ notified Nelson by email when her test results were ready. After checking her lab report through her own password-protected account on the BioIQ website, she printed a copy of the lab report and took it to her primary care physician, Dr. Jeffrey Sandler, a Scripps-affiliated physician.
“Patients who participate in biometric screening programs bring valuable data to their office visits in the form of lab reports and health assessments,” Dr. Sandler says. “In this instance, the home test triggered an office visit and gave me an opportunity to discuss Ms. Nelson’s condition.”
A Measurable ROI
These are the types of personal success stories that not only change lives, but have a measurable impact on the bottom line. Scripps Health has now completed the BioIQ program for four consecutive years. Based on a multi-year study, Mears says Scripps Wellness participants have 17% fewer emergency room visits and their medical and pharmacy costs are reduced by 30%. There is a 25% reduction in hospital visits. And they use 11% fewer prescriptions.
Interest in the BioIQ home testing program has risen each year. Mears says biometric results are the linchpin of their wellness program. “Our wellness program really works,” Mears concludes. “Our analysis of the cost utilization data reveals a 1.3 ROI coefficient, meaning for every $1 we spend on wellness, we recoup $1.30.”

Inspire Health Improvement Beyond the Screening
After the screening, employees can login to view detailed test results, access educational resources that target risks identified during the screening, and download a form designed to facilitate a follow-up discussion with their primary care physician. In the incentives tab, they can view points they have earned based on completion goals or by falling within healthy ranges for certain screenings.

                                        At Alere, our mission is to empower individuals to take charge of their health under the supervision of their healthcare providers. We bring this vision to life by developing smart products that address broad, unmet needs and extend diagnosis from the lab, doctor’s office, and hospital to people’s homes. We also build educational health management solutions around these products, which make it easier than ever to personalize care. Our programs connect patients to information that yields diagnostic results, and our smart platforms give healthcare providers seamless and instant access to these results, supplying them with the information they need to make the best decisions.

We believe that, when people are involved in their own care, they benefit from an improved quality of life. Our products and services lead to better health, less urgent medical interventions, fewer hospital visits, and reduced healthcare costs.
