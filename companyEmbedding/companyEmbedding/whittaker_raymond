BISHOP WILLIAM RAYMOND WHITAKER II, DD
Bishop William Raymond Whitaker, II was born in Newport News, Virginia on November 12, 1959.  Bishop Whitaker is a product of the Bedford Stuyvesant Tompkins Project community.  In June 1985, he was licensed by the Greater Free Gift Baptist Church and ordained in November 1986 under the inspirational leadership of the late Dr. Daniel Webster Batts.  On December 13, 1994, Bishop Whitaker was called by the Lord to serve as Pastor of this great church and moved into full-time ministry.
Under the leadership of Bishop Whitaker, Greater Free Gift is a church of education, celebration and support as well as spiritual elevation with the formation of the Drama and Dance Ministry and “Serenity on Stockton Street.”  He established the Greater Free Gift Bible Institute where he diligently shares his knowledge and wisdom as president and teacher.  In addition to being a dynamic preacher and most prolific teacher, Bishop Whitaker is a world-renowned vocalist.
Bishop Whitaker’s commitment to the community is evident by his service as the Former Chair of Evangelism for the Eastern Region of the Progressive National Baptist Convention.  He served as the Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Director of the Music Department of the New York Missionary Baptist Association.  Bishop Whitaker is the former Ecumenical Director to the Honorable Congressman Edolphus “Ed” Towns.  He graduated from Exponent ARRIVE as a licensed HIV/AIDS counselor and also served as mentor to the students at IS 33.  In January 2013 he was appointed as Chaplain for the New York City Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association where Norman Seabrook serves as President.
Bishop Whitaker earned his Bachelor of Theology degree in 1999 (Lighthouse Christian College – Beebe, Arkansas); Master of Theology degree in 2004 (summa cum laude - Chelsea University – London, England); and Doctor of Divinity degree in 2005 (Master’s Graduate School of Divinity – Evansville, Indiana).  In 2004, the Hope for All Bible College bestowed upon Bishop Whitaker an Honorary Doctorate of Divinity degree.
In March 2005, the Senior Pastor and Prelate of Agape Christian Fellowship of Covenant Churches and Ministries, Bishop David C. Wallace publicly proclaimed Bishop Whitaker as a Prince in the Lord’s Church.  Subsequently, on May 5, 2007, he was consecrated Bishop.
In August 2011, after much prayer, Bishop Whitaker joined the Pentecostal Churches of Christ reformation and was affirmed by The Most Reverend J. Delano Ellis II, the Presiding Prelate of Pentecostal Churches of Christ in Cleveland, Ohio, and the President of the Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops.  
His Motto - "I BELIEVE GOD"
