		Davis Value Portfolio
Portfolio of Davis Variable Account Fund, Inc.

For variable annuity investors seeking long-term capital appreciation from large-cap companies
Portfolio Overview

Investment Strategy
The goal of the Davis Value Portfolio is to provide investors access to attractive investment opportunities in large-cap, durable, well-managed businesses. We seek to purchase these businesses at value prices and hold them for the long term. This approach makes the Davis Value Portfolio an ideal foundation for an investor’s portfolio. 
Why Invest in the Davis Venture Value Portfolio
Sixty Years of Experience
Davis Advisors has successfully managed money through many environments – including periods of inflation, recession, rising and falling energy prices, rising and falling interest rates, and bull and bear markets. 
Consistency of the Davis Investment Discipline
For three generations, the Davis family has built wealth by investing in durable, well-managed businesses selling at value prices and holding them for the long term.
Aligned with Our Clients
With more than $2 billion invested side by side with our clients, we experience the same risks and reap the same rewards.1 
Long-Term Investment Results
Davis Advisors has a history of delivering strong, consistent investment results through full market cycles. 

How the Davis Value Portfolio is Currently Positioned
The Portfolio includes the following types of businesses: 

Strong global leaders represent the largest percentage of the Portfolio. 
Overlooked companies that are not widely followed but have strong business fundamentals represent a smaller percentage of the Portfolio. These companies are often quiet compounding machines for the Portfolio.
“Headline risk” companies represent the smallest percentage of the Portfolio. We believe these companies may add significantly to the Portfolio’s performance because their stock prices are frequently discounted relative to their intrinsic values.

Black swans? Here’s why the recent global breakout in stocks should NOT be trusted
              
              If the trend is, indeed, your friend, then more gains are on the way, because everything is breaking out around the world. Last week, nine key indexes busted through to record highs on the same day, including the Value Line Geometric Composite, maybe the broadest global gauge of them all.

Dow struggles to take flight as Wall Street focuses on earnings; Fed ahead
              
              The U.S. stock market opened slightly lower on Monday to start a week packed with corporate earnings releases and a midweek meeting of the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was trading less than 0.1% lower at 21,557, the S&P 500 index  was off about 0.1% at 2,470. The Nasdaq Composite Index , meanwhile, was trading flat at 6,390. Wall Street investors were paying attention to weakness in the dollar , and conversely strength in the euro . A weaker dollar tends to give a boost to multinational companies selling goods and services abroad, while a strengthening euro can provide a headwind to European companies selling outside of the eurozone. Market participants also watched a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for signs of any further moves to limit a glut of crude oil, which has weighed on futures prices . In corporate news, the market was watching the tumble in Hibbett Sports Inc. , which was sinking after it said it expected second-quarter sales to slump. Also, Shares of WebMD Health Corp.  soared on news that KKR & Co.  was looking to take the health-care information company private. Looking ahead, Google-parent Alphabet Inc.  is set to report after the close of trade on Monday. Further out, the Fed kicks off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday, with the central bank not expected to lift interest rates further, but clues about its policy plans and the state of the U.S. economy will be closely tracked in its updated statement. In economic news,  the IHS Markit flash purchasing managers index, a key business survey, came in at 55.8--lower than the 56.2 analysts had expected, and a six-month low for the index. A reading above 50 indicates economic growth.

Stocks Fall as Dollar Remains Under Pressure
              
              U.S. stocks slipped as the weakness of the U.S. dollar continued to affect global markets. The S&P 500 declined less than 0.1%.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Black swans? Here’s why the recent global breakout in stocks should NOT be trusted
              
              If the trend is, indeed, your friend, then more gains are on the way, because everything is breaking out around the world. Last week, nine key indexes busted through to record highs on the same day, including the Value Line Geometric Composite, maybe the broadest global gauge of them all.

Dow struggles to take flight as Wall Street focuses on earnings; Fed ahead
              
              The U.S. stock market opened slightly lower on Monday to start a week packed with corporate earnings releases and a midweek meeting of the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was trading less than 0.1% lower at 21,557, the S&P 500 index  was off about 0.1% at 2,470. The Nasdaq Composite Index , meanwhile, was trading flat at 6,390. Wall Street investors were paying attention to weakness in the dollar , and conversely strength in the euro . A weaker dollar tends to give a boost to multinational companies selling goods and services abroad, while a strengthening euro can provide a headwind to European companies selling outside of the eurozone. Market participants also watched a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for signs of any further moves to limit a glut of crude oil, which has weighed on futures prices . In corporate news, the market was watching the tumble in Hibbett Sports Inc. , which was sinking after it said it expected second-quarter sales to slump. Also, Shares of WebMD Health Corp.  soared on news that KKR & Co.  was looking to take the health-care information company private. Looking ahead, Google-parent Alphabet Inc.  is set to report after the close of trade on Monday. Further out, the Fed kicks off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday, with the central bank not expected to lift interest rates further, but clues about its policy plans and the state of the U.S. economy will be closely tracked in its updated statement. In economic news,  the IHS Markit flash purchasing managers index, a key business survey, came in at 55.8--lower than the 56.2 analysts had expected, and a six-month low for the index. A reading above 50 indicates economic growth.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
MARKET ENVIRONMENT                                                              

During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the stock market, as measured by the 
Standard & Poor's 500(R) Index, returned 11.76%.(1) This performance reflected a
vigorous rally over the last three months. In the first three months, stock     
prices were depressed by investor apprehension about geopolitical tensions and  
generally glum economic news. Although the U.S. military campaign in Iraq was   
brief and successful, economic uncertainty remained. Consumer spending stayed   
strong, but the job market deteriorated. The broad economy registered anemic    
growth. In March the market increased, and it continued in a positive trend     
through the end of June.                                                        

DAVIS VALUE PORTFOLIO                                                           
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW                                                            

The Davis Value Portfolio returned 11.59% for the six-month period ended June
30, 2003(2), compared with a return of 11.76% for the Standard & Poor's 500(R)  
Index.(1) The Portfolio's investment strategy is to seek out growing companies  
that can be purchased at value prices and held for the long-term.               

The Portfolio's largest sector weightings were in banks and savings & loans and 
financial services. The Portfolio's financial services holdings outperformed the
S&P 500(R) Index, but the Portfolio's banks and savings & loan holdings         
underperformed the S&P 500(R) Index. The Portfolio's cash position reduced      
relative performance during the strong bull market.                             

The principal holdings contributing to performance were: Progressive            
Corporation(3), a property/casualty insurance company, American Express, a      
financial services company, and Costco, a retailing company. The Portfolio held 
substantial positions in all three companies and all three did well over the    
six-month period, Progressive Corporation increased by 47.41%, American Express 
by 18.55% and Costco by 30.43%.                                                 

The principal detractors from performance were: Kraft Foods, Safeway, and       
American International Group. Kraft Foods, a food & restaurants company,        
decreased by 15.55%, Safeway, a retailing company, decreased by 12.41% and      
American International Group, a multi-line insurance company, decreased by      
4.45%.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - CONTINUED                                

This Semi-Annual Report is authorized for use by existing shareholders.         
Prospective shareholders must receive a current Davis Value Portfolio           
prospectus, which contains more information about risks, charges and expenses.  
Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.         

Davis Value Portfolio's investment objective is long-term growth of capital.    
There can be no assurance that the Portfolio will achieve its objective. The    
primary risks of an investment in Davis Value Portfolio are: (1) market risk,   
(2) company risk; (3) headline risk; and (4) selection risk. See the prospectus 
for a full description of each risk.                                            

(1) The S&P 500(R) Index is an unmanaged index of 500 selected common stocks,   
most of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The index is adjusted  
for dividends, weighted towards stocks with large market capitalizations, and   
represents approximately two-thirds of the total market value of all domestic   
common stocks. Investments cannot be made directly into the index.              

(2) Total return assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gain             
distributions. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investment
return and principal value will vary so that, when redeemed, an investor's      
shares may be worth more or less than when purchased. The following table lists 
the average annual total returns for the periods ended June 30, 2003.           

-------------------------------- ----------------- -------------------          
                               INCEPTION
PORTFOLIO NAME                   1 YEAR            (July 1, 1999)               
-------------------------------- ----------------- -------------------          
Davis Value Portfolio              3.86%               (1.55%)                  
-------------------------------- ----------------- -------------------          

Performance numbers are net of all portfolio operating expenses, but do not     
include any insurance charges imposed by your insurance company's separate      
account. If performance information included the effect of these additional     
charges, the total return would be lower.                                       

Portfolio performance changes over time and current performance may be higher or
lower than stated. For more current information please call Davis Funds         
Shareholder Services at 1-800-279-0279.                                         

(3) This Management Discussion & Analysis discusses a number of individual      
companies. The information provided in this report does not provide information 
reasonably sufficient upon which to base an investment decision and should not  
be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any particular security. The 
schedule of investments lists the Portfolio's holdings of each company          
discussed.                                                                      

Shares of the Davis Funds are not deposits or obligations of any bank, are not  
guaranteed by any bank, are not insured by the FDIC or any other agency, and    
involve investment risks, including possible loss of the principal amount       
invested.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             

    The Fund is a separate series of Davis Variable Account Fund, Inc., which is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a           
diversified, open-end management investment company. Shares of the Fund may only
be purchased by insurance companies for the purpose of funding variable annuity 
or variable life insurance contracts. The following is a summary of significant 
accounting policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of financial        
statements.                                                                     

Davis Value Portfolio is a diversified, professionally managed          
stock-oriented fund.                                                            

A. VALUATION OF SECURITIES - Portfolio securities listed on national securities 
exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation.  
Securities traded in the over the counter market and listed securities for which
no sale was reported on that date are stated at the average of closing bid and  
asked prices. Securities for which market quotations are not readily available  
are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. 
Short-term obligations are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair    
value. These valuation procedures are reviewed and subject to approval by the   
Board of Directors.                                                             

B. MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The Fund, along with other affiliated funds,  
may transfer uninvested cash balances into one or more master repurchase        
agreement accounts. These balances are invested in one or more repurchase       
agreements, secured by U.S. government securities. Securities pledged as        
collateral for repurchase agreements are held by a custodian bank until the     
agreements mature. Each agreement requires that the market value of the         
collateral be sufficient to cover payments of interest and principal; however,  
in the event of default by the other party to the agreement, retention of the   
collateral may be subject to legal proceedings.                                 

C. CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The market values of all assets and liabilities       
denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the financial statements after
translation to the U.S. dollar based upon the mean between the bid and offered  
quotations of the currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. The 
cost basis of such assets and liabilities is determined based upon historical   
exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in 
effect as accrued or incurred.                                                  

D. FOREIGN CURRENCY - The Fund may enter into forward purchases or sales of     
foreign currencies to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets and     
liabilities against declines in market value relative to the U.S. dollar.       
Forward currency contracts are marked-to-market daily and the change in market  
value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or loss. When the forward   
currency contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to  
the difference between the value of the forward currency contract at the time it
was opened and value at the time it was closed. Investments in forward currency 
contracts may expose the Fund to risks resulting from unanticipated movements in
foreign currency exchange rates or failure of the counter-party to the agreement
to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract.                        

   Reported net realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from the sales
and maturities of investments, sales of foreign currencies, currency gains or   
losses realized between the trade and settlement dates on securities            
transactions, the difference between the amounts of dividends, interest and     
foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Fund's books, and the U.S. dollar     
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign     
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in the value of assets and         
liabilities other than investments in securities at fiscal year end, resulting  
from changes in the exchange rate. The Fund includes foreign currency gains and 
losses realized on the sale of investments together with market gains and losses
on such investments in the statement of operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)                                     
June 30, 2003 (Unaudited)                                                       
=============================================================================== 

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (Continued)               

E. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES - It is the Fund's policy to comply with the            
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment    
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income, including  
any net realized gains on investments not offset by loss carryovers, to         
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income or excise tax is       
required. At June 30, 2003 the Fund had available for federal income tax        
purposes unused capital loss carryovers of $6,568,000 and $19,386,000, which    
expire in 2009 and 2010, respectively.                                          

F. USE OF ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - In preparing financial statements 
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and       
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported    
amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may  
differ from these estimates.                                                    

G. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED INVESTMENT INCOME - Securities           
transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the order to buy or sell 
is executed) with realized gain or loss on the sale of securities being         
determined based upon identified cost. Dividend income is recorded on the       
ex-dividend date. Interest income, which includes accretion of discount and     
amortization of premium, is accrued as earned.                                  

H. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS - Dividends and distributions to 
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Net investment income (loss),
net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of   
investments may differ for financial statement and tax purposes primarily       
because of the recognition of certain foreign currency gains (losses) as        
ordinary income (loss) for tax purposes and the tax deferral of losses on "wash 
sale" transactions. The character of dividends and distributions made during the
fiscal year from net investment income and net realized securities gains may    
differ from their ultimate characterization for federal income tax purposes.    
Also, due to the timing of dividends and distributions, the fiscal year in which
amounts are distributed may differ from the fiscal year in which income or      
realized gain was recorded by the Fund. The Fund adjusts the classification of  
distributions to shareholders to reflect the differences between financial      
statement amounts and distributions determined in accordance with income tax    
regulations.
