Home>News and Events>News>NOV’s stick-slip mitigation system featured in June Offshore Engineer









NOV’s stick-slip mitigation system featured in June Offshore Engineer

























The SoftSpeed™ II stick-slip mitigation system was developed by National Oilwell Varco (NOV) to combat the stick-slip phenomenon, which is a mode of drilling dysfunction characterized by a cycle of the bit coming to a stop and accelerating to speeds greater than the mean BHA speed. Stick-slip can lead to a variety of problems, including severe bit damage, reduced drilling performance, and failure of tools and motors, if not properly addressed.
The SoftSpeed II system uses automated vibration dampening to mitigate torsional vibration and reduce stick-slip oscillations during drilling operations. A dedicated team of highly qualified NOV engineers and personnel work to commission and setup the system, linking the software to a real-time technology center. This enables constant monitoring of the system, which allows onshore engineers to have instant insight into drilling performance metrics.
A North Sea operator was encountering periods of extreme stick-slip in their 8½-in. horizontal section, with stick-slip severity levels close to 100%. This level of drilling vibration is inefficient and damaging to equipment. After coping with this level of stick-slip severity for 9 hours and drilling at an average ROP of 62.3 ft/hr, the SoftSpeed II system was turned on to increase performance. As a result of using the system, ROP was increased by 6.6 ft/hr to 68.9 ft/hr, which allowed the rig to drill approximately one and a half extra stands in that day compared to the prior drilling rate.
The SoftSpeed II system and this project were featured in this month’s issue of Offshore Engineer. Read the full article here.

Home>News and Events>News>NOV’s vision solutions featured in May June Drilling Contractor









NOV’s vision solutions featured in May/June Drilling Contractor

























Strix™ vision solutions were developed by National Oilwell Varco (NOV) to meet customer demands for process automation and optimization of traditional rig-floor drilling processes. The Strix stickup height detection (SHD) technology provides an accurate height setpoint for pipe-handling machines during drill pipe and casing trip-in sequences. Doing this, using imaging sensors and computer vision techniques, enables increased efficiency and consistency.
Conventional approaches to iron roughneck positioning often involve manual height verification and coordinate setting. The discrepancy in individual user abilities, combined with an inefficient system of movement based on iron roughneck trajectories, can lead to the need for additional equipment and/or sensors, resulting in time-consuming sequences. By using this automated system, sensors don’t have to be installed next to objects as pipe height is measured remotely, with feedback to the control system yielding automatic and optimized machine trajectories.
Strix vision solutions and this project were featured in the May/June edition of Drilling Contractor. Read the full article here.

History[edit]
National Oilwell's two main predecessors, Oilwell Supply and National Supply, were founded in 1862 and 1893, respectively. These two companies manufactured and distributed pumps and derricks. In 1930, United States Steel acquired Oilwell Supply. In 1958, Armco Steel merged with National Supply. In 1987, National Supply merged with USS Oilwell to become "National Oilwell". In 2000, National Oilwell merged with IRI International Corp., founded and managed by Hushang Ansary, which manufactures and sells drilling rigs and specialty steel products.[8]
Varco was founded as Abegg and Reinhold Company by Walter Abegg and Baldwin Reinhold in 1908. "VARCO" is an acronym for: Vuilleumiere, Abegg and Reinhold Company after Edgar Vuilleumiere became a partner in 1915, and Varco International in 1973.
In 2005, National Oilwell and Varco merged to become National Oilwell Varco. In 2014, Clay Williams took over as CEO, succeeding former CEO Pete Miller, who served as NOV's CEO for nearly 13 years.[1] Miller will become Executive Chairman of the National Oilwell Varco spinoff company, DistributionNow. The company employs nearly 64,000 people and has over 1,200 facilities across six continents worldwide.[2] In February 2012 NOV acquired a Russian coring company Interval Ltd.

History[edit]
National Oilwell's two main predecessors, Oilwell Supply and National Supply, were founded in 1862 and 1893, respectively. These two companies manufactured and distributed pumps and derricks. In 1930, United States Steel acquired Oilwell Supply. In 1958, Armco Steel merged with National Supply. In 1987, National Supply merged with USS Oilwell to become "National Oilwell". In 2000, National Oilwell merged with IRI International Corp., founded and managed by Hushang Ansary, which manufactures and sells drilling rigs and specialty steel products.[8]
Varco was founded as Abegg and Reinhold Company by Walter Abegg and Baldwin Reinhold in 1908. "VARCO" is an acronym for: Vuilleumiere, Abegg and Reinhold Company after Edgar Vuilleumiere became a partner in 1915, and Varco International in 1973.
In 2005, National Oilwell and Varco merged to become National Oilwell Varco. In 2014, Clay Williams took over as CEO, succeeding former CEO Pete Miller, who served as NOV's CEO for nearly 13 years.[1] Miller will become Executive Chairman of the National Oilwell Varco spinoff company, DistributionNow. The company employs nearly 64,000 people and has over 1,200 facilities across six continents worldwide.[2] In February 2012 NOV acquired a Russian coring company Interval Ltd.

National Oilwell Varco Enters into Credit Agreement Five Year Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility
Jun 28 17
On June 27, 2017, National Oilwell Varco, Inc. entered into a credit agreement evidencing a five year unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, the other agents named therein, and the lenders parties thereto (the 2017 Facility), pursuant to which the Company may borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.0 billion. The 2017 Facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 2017 Facility bear interest at the rates specified in the Credit Agreement, and the Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including a maximum capitalization ratio covenant. The Company has the right to increase the aggregate commitments under the 2017 Facility to an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 billion upon the consent of only those lenders holding any such increase. As a result of entering into the 2017 Facility, on June 27, 2017, the Company terminated its credit agreement dated September 28, 2012 with a syndicate of lenders, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. Such agreement provided for a $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which was increased to $4.5 billion in May 2015 (the 2012 Facility). The 2012 Facility was scheduled to expire in September 2018. Borrowings under the 2012 Facility bore interest at the rates specified in the credit agreement, and the credit agreement contained customary covenants, including a maximum capitalization ratio covenant. There were no termination penalties incurred by the Company in connection with the termination of the 2012 Facility.

National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Expands Completion Tool Technology Product Offering
Jun 1 17
National Oilwell Varco, Inc. announced the introduction of several new proprietary technologies to its completion tools portfolio: Bulldog Frac™ - a sliding-sleeve annular fracturing system that provides pinpoint accuracy, zonal isolation, and improved reliability; Bullmastiff™ - a ball-drop openhole sliding-sleeve sand control fracturing system; Rottweiler™ - a product family of compact, high-performance frac plugs for the plug-and-perf market; ReAct™ - an intelligent completion tool technology that offers remote signaling capabilities for valves and sleeves for a variety of applications and completion designs; and German Oil Tools – a line of advanced liner hanger systems and other completion tool technologies, products, and accessories. Bulldog Frac Pinpoint Annular Fracturing System: The Bulldog Frac annular fracturing system enables operators to precisely control the placement of proppant in each stage by pumping down the coiled tubing annulus through Multiple Open/Close (MOC) sliding sleeves, providing for an unlimited number of stages and leaving no restrictions in the wellbore. The Bulldog Frac system addresses the operational challenges of most MOC systems with a “shift up to open” design, performed with NOV’s proprietary hydraulic shifting tool, which ensures no sleeves are accidentally closed on the trip out. Unlike competitors’ products, Bulldog frac sleeves are compact, lightweight, and do not require handling pup joints, allowing for safer and more efficient installation. Additionally, the Bulldog incorporates NOV’s patented and field-proven sealing system, which offers full pressure testing of previously manipulated sleeves even after several years in service. Bullmastiff Openhole Sand Control Ball-Drop Fracturing System: The Bullmastiff fracturing system is a proprietary openhole sliding-sleeve system that incorporates sand screens to eliminate costly sand-production issues while maximizing hydrocarbon production. The ball-drop frac sleeve component is the first to allow for proppant stimulation with integral sand control, segregating the stimulation port from the production port. The Bullmastiff incorporates NOV’s patented flex sleeve and sealing technology to allow for maximum stage-count flexibility. Rottweiler Frac Plugs: Compact, large-bore Rottweiler frac plugs are the shortest on the market but still offer optimum performance during fracturing operations. Rottweiler frac plugs can be pumped in at high displacement rates, hold high differential pressure, and are easily milled. Additionally, Rottweiler frac plugs are the only products to offer a built-in chemical tracer that provides real-time data on reservoir characteristics during frac jobs to enhance production. Rottweiler frac plugs are currently available in cast-iron, with a composite version expected to be released in the near future. ReAct Remote Activation Technology: The ReAct product family, which was acquired from Omega Completion Technology, offers remote signaling capabilities to downhole valves and sleeves. The technology can be utilized for a number of applications including programmable sleeves, which respond to a particular pressure or flow signal and require no hydraulic or umbilical lines to surface. The ReAct technology currently has applications for inflow control (for water shutoff or zonal isolation), liner hanger deployment, production packer setting, and wellbore cleanup in preparation for flow-through sand screen completions. These interventionless solutions provide the lowest-cost intelligent completion technologies on the market. German Oil Tools Liner Hanger Technologies: German Oil Tools offers a portfolio of well-construction and completion products that are highly regarded for quality and reliability and are currently sold in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The operation, which includes GPS Oil Tools, will continue to develop and manufacture products in Germany to retain high standards of quality, craftsmanship, and innovation, but will benefit from NOV’s global sales organization and supply chain to accelerate its ability to meet customers’ growing demand for reliable, cost-efficient completions solutions around the world.

Progressing Cavity Pumps
Different as they are, mine water, raw sewage, sludge cake, latex, crude oil, lime slurry, and molasses all have one thing in common: they can be pumped using NOV Monoflo progressing cavity (PC) pumps.
PC pumps are ideal for handling shear-sensitive fluids that contain abrasive materials and/or high solids content regardless of their viscosity.

PC pumps consist of a single helix shaft (rotor) that rotates within a double helix fixed housing (stator).The rotor always has one less helix than the stator, so when it rotates, it forms a continuous cavity that progresses towards the discharge end of the pump to convey process fluid out.
With a PC pump, pressure is independent of speed, which allows the pump to achieve the head required while running at a low speed for long wear life. Well-suited for both low- and high-flow applications, PC pumps can be adapted into multi-stage pumps for high pressure-handling capabilities.

Features and Benefits:

Continuous flow eliminates pipework-damaging pulsations
Continuous seal line between rotor and stator eliminates product backflow and slip
Variety of construction materials for adaptability to nearly any operating condition
Low running speeds for long wear life
Rolling action of rotor releases trapped solids quickly, reducing abrasive wear
Long-haul pumping eliminates the need for a series of pumps
Suction lift up to 28’ allows deep sumps to be emptied without submersible equipment
Gentle pumping action keeps delicate solids intact, minimizing shear, crush damage, and solid degradation
Continuous cavities handle suspended solids with ease
Constant discharge capacity for a given speed, rotation, and pressure for accurate metering and dosing
Reduced wear extends periods between routine maintenance
Positive displacement for a uniform flow
Dual directional capability allows one pump to meet all operational needs
Ability to turn suction chamber 90° for easy installation

Rotary Lobe Pumps
Monoflo's range of hygienic rotary lobe pumps have been specifically developed to prevent product contamination.
High specification models are designed according to 3A and EHEDG certification and the pumps are suitable for clean in place and sterilization in place.
As the rotors rotate in an opposite direction without contact with each other or the casing, the metal parts do not wear and contaminate the product.
With maximum flow volumes up to 1320 gpm, Monoflo's lobe pumps are able to handle a wide range of viscosities.
Rotary lobe pumps have many advantages, particularly in the food and beverage and pharmaceutical industries.

Manufactured to a hygienically approved design
They can self prime on low lifts with standard clearance rotors
Can handle solids in suspension
They can run dry for short periods when using standard rotors. Suitable for applications where dry-running occurs or is required as part of the process.
The gentle pumping action minimizes shear and crush damage to delicate liquids containing soft solids

Pneumatic Driven Positive Displacement Pumps
NOV offers a wide range of Bear pneumatic driven positive displacement pumps, including both air operated pumps and portable hydrostatic test units.

National Oilwell Varco, Inc.'s Results Continue Their Slow Grind Higher
The oil-field equipment maker notched its second consecutive quarter of rising revenue and third straight profit improvement.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Apr 27, 2017 at 11:30AM
            
            





The oil industry is slowly but surely starting to pull out of its nosedive. With those improving conditions, companies are starting to spend more money on equipment, which is in turn driving a recovery in National Oilwell Varco's (NYSE:NOV) financial results. While it has been a slow process since the industry's recovery has primarily been onshore, the company expects that as the upturn continues to take hold, it will "benefit disproportionately" because of its low costs and product portfolio. 
Drilling down into the numbers
National Oilwell Varco reported $1.74 billion in revenue for the quarter, which, while down 20% versus the prior year, is up 3% versus last quarter, marking the second consecutive quarterly increase. That said, the company did report another quarterly loss. Even after adjusting for one-time items, it had an operating loss of $63 million, or $0.17 per share, which was slightly worse than last quarter's loss of $57 million, or $0.15 per share. However, its underlying earnings as measured by adjusted EBITDA rose to $105 million, up $3 million from last quarter, which was the third straight jump.

Driving these improvements were sales of equipment to the North American land market, especially products in its wellbore technologies and completion and production solutions segments:



Segment Revenue

Q1 2017

Q4 2016

Q1 2016





Rig systems


 $393 million


 $426 million


 $926 million




Rig aftermarket


 $321 million


 $339 million


 $391 million




Wellbore technologies


 $555 million


 $531 million


 $631 million




Completion and production solutions


 $648 million


 $602 million


 $558 million




Data source: National Oilwell Varco.
Leading the way was the completion and production solutions segment. Not only did revenue increase 8% versus last quarter and 16% versus the year-ago period but adjusted EBITDA surged 12% and 60%, respectively, over those same periods. 





Another positive was sales in the wellbore technologies segment, which rose 5% versus last quarter and fueled a 90% surge in adjusted EBITDA. That said, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were both down 12% year over year.
Meanwhile, the company's other two segments, rig systems and rig aftermarket, continued to decline because both focus heavily on the offshore market, which hasn't yet hit bottom. Actual results, though, differed significantly from the company's expectations heading into the quarter. For example, it thought that rig systems revenue would drop 10% to 12% through aggressive cost management would keep the profit decline to a minimum. However, while the sales decrease of 8% beat guidance, adjusted EBITDA plunged 42% versus last quarter. Meanwhile, rig aftermarket experienced a similar result as the 5% slump in revenue matched expectations for a mid-single-digit decline. However, the company expected profits to flatten out thanks to a more favorable sales mix, which didn't happen since adjusted EBITDA tumbled another 11%.
What management had to say
While the company delivered mixed results overall, management seemed pleased that they at least continued to head in the right direction. CEO Clay Williams pointed out in the press release that "the Company posted its second consecutive quarter of rising revenues and its third consecutive quarter of rising adjusted EBITDA." Furthermore, he noted that the driving force behind that improvement was the North America land market, which "generated solid sequential improvements in profitability and are growing quickly. This lifted National Oilwell Varco's consolidated mix of land revenues to 57% during the first quarter of 2017." That shift toward land is worth nothing because the offshore market had dominated the company's sales for most of the past several years. Due to the strong drilling economics of North American shale plays, though, drillers are allocating most of their capital to those regions right now.
That increase in spending is having a noticeable impact on service companies. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), for example, saw a 30% uptick in its U.S. land revenue last quarter, which offset continued activity declines in international markets. Meanwhile, Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) CEO Martin Craighead noted that the "onshore rig count increase in North America has been more robust than many had expected." Both companies expect this trend to continue, which bodes well for National Oilwell Varco. 





International and offshore activities remain a different story, however. As Halliburton President Jeff Miller noted, "We are in the midst of a unique and challenging cycle with very different dynamics between the North American and international markets... I am excited by the activity I see in North America and confident in our ability to manage through any challenges in the international markets." Meanwhile, Craighead said that "we expect there to be headwinds offshore throughout the rest of 2017." That said, as National Oilwell Varco's CEO put it, the global market as a whole "is slowly grinding higher," which is a good thing after the challenges of the past two years.

National Oilwell Varco headquarters in Greater Sharpstown, Houston


National Oilwell Varco (NOV) is an American multinational corporation based in Greater Sharpstown, Houston, Texas.[3][4] It is a leading worldwide provider of equipment and components used in oil and gas drilling and production operations, oilfield services, and supply chain integration services to the upstream oil and gas industry. The company conducts operations in more than 1,200 locations across six continents.[2]
The Company's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NOV".[5] The company operates through four reporting segments that were reorganized in 2014: Rig Systems, Rig Aftermarket, Completion and Production Solutions, and Wellbore Technologies.[6]
Products include all the heavy hardware for oil well drilling as well as drilling instrumentation and controls and drilling power generation and control. A partial list of heavy hardware includes topdrives, rotarys, drawworks, derricks, BOPs (blowout preventers), mud pumps, riser equipment, and complete drilling rigs. Products also include instruments and controls required on the rig floor for the drilling operation. This includes sophisticated electronics for precise control, such as the control system Cyberbase. NOV also produces control electronics for power generation and control of drilling motors and motor control centers for AC motor control.
In 2008, the Houston Chronicle ranked National Oilwell Varco as the best company in Greater Houston. In 2007, the newspaper ranked National Oilwell Varco number 15.[7]
NOV is the Houston area's largest energy employer, with more than 14,500 workers in the region, according to Houston Business Journal research.[1]

History[edit]
National Oilwell's two main predecessors, Oilwell Supply and National Supply, were founded in 1862 and 1893, respectively. These two companies manufactured and distributed pumps and derricks. In 1930, United States Steel acquired Oilwell Supply. In 1958, Armco Steel merged with National Supply. In 1987, National Supply merged with USS Oilwell to become "National Oilwell". In 2000, National Oilwell merged with IRI International Corp., founded and managed by Hushang Ansary, which manufactures and sells drilling rigs and specialty steel products.[8]
Varco was founded as Abegg and Reinhold Company by Walter Abegg and Baldwin Reinhold in 1908. "VARCO" is an acronym for: Vuilleumiere, Abegg and Reinhold Company after Edgar Vuilleumiere became a partner in 1915, and Varco International in 1973.
In 2005, National Oilwell and Varco merged to become National Oilwell Varco. In 2014, Clay Williams took over as CEO, succeeding former CEO Pete Miller, who served as NOV's CEO for nearly 13 years.[1] Miller will become Executive Chairman of the National Oilwell Varco spinoff company, DistributionNow. The company employs nearly 64,000 people and has over 1,200 facilities across six continents worldwide.[2] In February 2012 NOV acquired a Russian coring company Interval Ltd.

National Oilwell Varco headquarters in Greater Sharpstown, Houston


National Oilwell Varco (NOV) is an American multinational corporation based in Greater Sharpstown, Houston, Texas.[3][4] It is a leading worldwide provider of equipment and components used in oil and gas drilling and production operations, oilfield services, and supply chain integration services to the upstream oil and gas industry. The company conducts operations in more than 1,200 locations across six continents.[2]
The Company's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NOV".[5] The company operates through four reporting segments that were reorganized in 2014: Rig Systems, Rig Aftermarket, Completion and Production Solutions, and Wellbore Technologies.[6]
Products include all the heavy hardware for oil well drilling as well as drilling instrumentation and controls and drilling power generation and control. A partial list of heavy hardware includes topdrives, rotarys, drawworks, derricks, BOPs (blowout preventers), mud pumps, riser equipment, and complete drilling rigs. Products also include instruments and controls required on the rig floor for the drilling operation. This includes sophisticated electronics for precise control, such as the control system Cyberbase. NOV also produces control electronics for power generation and control of drilling motors and motor control centers for AC motor control.
In 2008, the Houston Chronicle ranked National Oilwell Varco as the best company in Greater Houston. In 2007, the newspaper ranked National Oilwell Varco number 15.[7]
NOV is the Houston area's largest energy employer, with more than 14,500 workers in the region, according to Houston Business Journal research.[1]

History[edit]
National Oilwell's two main predecessors, Oilwell Supply and National Supply, were founded in 1862 and 1893, respectively. These two companies manufactured and distributed pumps and derricks. In 1930, United States Steel acquired Oilwell Supply. In 1958, Armco Steel merged with National Supply. In 1987, National Supply merged with USS Oilwell to become "National Oilwell". In 2000, National Oilwell merged with IRI International Corp., founded and managed by Hushang Ansary, which manufactures and sells drilling rigs and specialty steel products.[8]
Varco was founded as Abegg and Reinhold Company by Walter Abegg and Baldwin Reinhold in 1908. "VARCO" is an acronym for: Vuilleumiere, Abegg and Reinhold Company after Edgar Vuilleumiere became a partner in 1915, and Varco International in 1973.
In 2005, National Oilwell and Varco merged to become National Oilwell Varco. In 2014, Clay Williams took over as CEO, succeeding former CEO Pete Miller, who served as NOV's CEO for nearly 13 years.[1] Miller will become Executive Chairman of the National Oilwell Varco spinoff company, DistributionNow. The company employs nearly 64,000 people and has over 1,200 facilities across six continents worldwide.[2] In February 2012 NOV acquired a Russian coring company Interval Ltd.

National Oilwell Varco headquarters in Greater Sharpstown, Houston


National Oilwell Varco (NOV) is an American multinational corporation based in Greater Sharpstown, Houston, Texas.[3][4] It is a leading worldwide provider of equipment and components used in oil and gas drilling and production operations, oilfield services, and supply chain integration services to the upstream oil and gas industry. The company conducts operations in more than 1,200 locations across six continents.[2]
The Company's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NOV".[5] The company operates through four reporting segments that were reorganized in 2014: Rig Systems, Rig Aftermarket, Completion and Production Solutions, and Wellbore Technologies.[6]
Products include all the heavy hardware for oil well drilling as well as drilling instrumentation and controls and drilling power generation and control. A partial list of heavy hardware includes topdrives, rotarys, drawworks, derricks, BOPs (blowout preventers), mud pumps, riser equipment, and complete drilling rigs. Products also include instruments and controls required on the rig floor for the drilling operation. This includes sophisticated electronics for precise control, such as the control system Cyberbase. NOV also produces control electronics for power generation and control of drilling motors and motor control centers for AC motor control.
In 2008, the Houston Chronicle ranked National Oilwell Varco as the best company in Greater Houston. In 2007, the newspaper ranked National Oilwell Varco number 15.[7]
NOV is the Houston area's largest energy employer, with more than 14,500 workers in the region, according to Houston Business Journal research.[1]

History[edit]
National Oilwell's two main predecessors, Oilwell Supply and National Supply, were founded in 1862 and 1893, respectively. These two companies manufactured and distributed pumps and derricks. In 1930, United States Steel acquired Oilwell Supply. In 1958, Armco Steel merged with National Supply. In 1987, National Supply merged with USS Oilwell to become "National Oilwell". In 2000, National Oilwell merged with IRI International Corp., founded and managed by Hushang Ansary, which manufactures and sells drilling rigs and specialty steel products.[8]
Varco was founded as Abegg and Reinhold Company by Walter Abegg and Baldwin Reinhold in 1908. "VARCO" is an acronym for: Vuilleumiere, Abegg and Reinhold Company after Edgar Vuilleumiere became a partner in 1915, and Varco International in 1973.
In 2005, National Oilwell and Varco merged to become National Oilwell Varco. In 2014, Clay Williams took over as CEO, succeeding former CEO Pete Miller, who served as NOV's CEO for nearly 13 years.[1] Miller will become Executive Chairman of the National Oilwell Varco spinoff company, DistributionNow. The company employs nearly 64,000 people and has over 1,200 facilities across six continents worldwide.[2] In February 2012 NOV acquired a Russian coring company Interval Ltd.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
