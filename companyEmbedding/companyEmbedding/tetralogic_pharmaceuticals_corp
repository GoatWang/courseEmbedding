					Full Description



TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals Corporation, incorporated on October 22, 2003, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on discovering and developing small molecule therapeutics in oncology, infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. The Company's segment is the identification and development of novel small molecule therapies in oncology and infectious diseases. The Company has approximately two clinical-stage product candidates in development, such as birinapant and SHAPE. SHAPE is the Company's histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that it is developing for topical use for the treatment of early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The Company is also exploring studying SHAPE in alopecia areata, an autoimmune skin disease resulting in the loss of hair on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. SHAPE has been granted the United States orphan drug designation for CTCL. SHAPE is a therapeutic designed to maximize HDAC inhibition locally in the skin with limited systemic exposure. The Company is conducting Phase II clinical trial of SHAPE.Birinapant is a small molecule therapeutic that mimics Second Mitochondrial Activator of Caspases (SMAC)-mimetic, which leads to apoptosis or cell-death in damaged cells. The Company holds development and commercialization rights of Birinapant for all indications. Birinapant is a bivalent molecule similar to endogenous SMAC and allows for direct engagement of approximately two inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) molecules.The Company competes with Merck & Co., Inc., Celgene Corporation, Abbott Laboratories, Novartis AG, Janssen, Italfarmaco S.p.A., MethylGene Inc., Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MEI Pharma Inc., Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., OncoSec Medical, Galderma S.A., Johnson & Johnson, Curis Inc., Debiopharma S.A., Astex Pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Ensemble Therapeutics, Genentech Inc., GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead Sciences.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

We currently have two clinical-stage product candidates in development: birinapant and suberohydroxamic acid (4-methoxycarbonyl) phenyl ester (SHAPE).  Birinapant is designed to mimic the activity of an endogenous protein, the Second Mitochondrial Activator of Caspases, or SMAC, which is involved in the regulation of the apoptotic process within cells. Avoidance of apoptosis is a critical step in cancer tumor development and certain infectious diseases.  SHAPE is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, or HDACi. Altered expression of histone deacetylases, or HDACs, has been linked to tumor development and several drugs approved for systemic use in the treatment of cancers take advantage of this mechanism.      *DISCLAIMER *The Board Monitor and The Board Assistants herewith, are not licensed brokers and assume NO responsibility for the actions, investment decisions, and or messages posted on this forum. • We do NOT recommend that anyone buy or sell any securities posted herewith.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
