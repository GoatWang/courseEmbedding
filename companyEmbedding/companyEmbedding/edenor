          175 years of heritage and innovation for renewable solutions suited from basics to niche applications.
          We proudly trace our 175-year heritage in oleochemicals to The Emery Candle Company, a store-front that manufactured and produced tallow for oil lamps in Cincinnati in 1840. Today, having established a brand that is synonymous with the production of high quality, natural-based chemicals - Emery Oleochemicals’ philosophy of Creating Value is principled on our ability of offering back-end integration, sustainable access to renewable feedstock; global footprint and in-depth technical know-how.
With products that are predominantly made from natural oils and fats such as palm oil, palm kernel oil and tallow, our wide ranging product portfolio, caters to the diverse and unique needs of an evolving marketplace.

Responsible Palm-Based Production

          Creating Value for your business with Supply Chain System certified SG and MB Solutions.

              Our fatty acids are made entirely from natural oils and fats derived from renewable raw materials such as coconuts, oil palms, sunflower seeds, rapeseed and tallow. Through our EDENOR®, EMERSOL™ and EMERY® product suites, we produce an extensive range of distilled, fractionated, polyunsaturated, oleic, stearic and food grade fatty acids that are used in the food and beverage, cosmetics, personal care, pharmaceutical and metal working, amongst others.  
            
These natural-based solutions are developed using our profound knowledge of esterification and other processing techniques - some developed over a 170 years ago.

              Our OleoBasics business provides a broad product portfolio of saturated fatty alcohols made entirely from natural oils and fats derived mainly from palm oil and palm kernel oil. Benefitting our customers with its eco-friendly properties, our chemicals are designed with our years of experience and know how; providing customers with an environmentally friendly alternative to many other chemicals used in the industry today.
            
By transesterifying and hydrogenating natural oils, we produce an extensive range of fractionated, short chain, long chain and broad cut alcohols. These natural-based solutions complement our total product offering - one of the world’s largest using renewable feedstocks.

             In the 1970s, we began to produce 99.8% grade glycerin through our newly extended plant in Cincinnati, Ohio. This was a quality of the highest grade at that time. Today, our glycerin solutions serve an increasing number of customers worldwide through our EDENOR®, EMERY® and glycerin brands that are sought after for use in end-use industries including food (as sweeteners in confectionary, bread, cakes, pastries and ice cream), dental care, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and tobacco. 
            
We manufacture glycerin by splitting natural oils and fats obtained from coconuts, oil palms, sunflower seeds, soybeans, rapeseed and tallow. As a result of our extensive industry expertise and continual innovation, our glycerin products are available in a wide variety of technical qualities, from 86% up to 99.8%.

These 'whole cut ' esters is subsequently processed into various alkyl range cuts by fractional distillation such as broad cut and fractionated methyl esters. Our fatty acid methyl esters are used extensively as intermediates in the manufacture of emulsifiers, wetting agents, stabilisers, textile treatments, and waxes among other uses.

Necesita mejoras


            Está muy bien que soporte Windows Mobile 10. Pero si ofrecen login con Yahoo, debería funcionar, en su lugar dice que uses Facebook. El medidor online me lo ofrece, pero no está habilitado para mi medidor, no se por qué. En lugar de ofrecer los bancos donde pagar, debería ofrecer pasarelas de pago online.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
