	United Way

      
The Greater Twin Cities United Way celebrated its Centennial Year with 3M’s Chairman, President and CEO, Inge Thulin, the 2015 campaign leader. 3Mers answered the call to step up and help those in need. During the 2015 campaign, 3Mers donated $6.1 million and 53,000 hours of their time—both records for the program. These results earned 3M the Greater Twin Cities United Way "Best in Show" award for the second year in a row – the first time back-to-back win ever accomplished by a company in the Twin Cities. In addition, 3M Austin won the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award from the United Way for Greater Austin.














3M is thankful for our longstanding partnership with United Way organizations worldwide, and in particular the Greater Twin Cities United Way.

As part of the 2015 campaign, more than 800 3Mers and their families ran and walked to support the United Way at 3M's 5K Fun Racer.

            Investing our resources. Investing ourselves.
            

3Mgives promotes stronger and more sustainable communities through financial investments, product donations and our most impactful resource, our people.
3Mgives improves lives and builds sustainable communities through social investments and thoughtful engagement of 3Mers worldwide. 3M was one of the first companies to establish a foundation in 1953. Our commitment to the community has only grown stronger. 3M harnesses financial investments, business expertise and our people to maximize impact in 3M communities.
3Mgives continues to support initiatives that have a real impact in communities and that provide solutions to some of the world's most pressing challenges. Our investments are more impactful as a result of partnerships with organizations with a proven track record for delivering results.

	3Mgives makes a positive impact in our three focus areas.

      












          Education
          


3Mgives supports initiatives that increase student interest in STEM and business to help build a diverse pipeline of future leaders.
For example, our 3M Visiting Wizards program shares the magic of science with students through demonstrations and hands-on experiments. More than 800,000 students have seen science applied in demonstrations ranging from catapults to cryogenics.

          Community
          


3Mgives enhances community vibrancy by improving standards of living, preparing youth for life-long success, increasing access to quality and diverse arts opportunities and contributing to global humanitarian relief efforts.
For example, 3M is providing support for Hurricane Matthew relief efforts. The company is responding by providing products. In addition, 3M has made a $100,000 financial commitment and is matching employee gifts.

          Environment
          


3Mgives invests in programs that foster sustainable communities.
In one example, 3M committed a $5 million investment to the Closed Loop Fund, a collaborative social impact resource that provides municipalities with access to capital needed to build comprehensive recycling programs.

	Featured Partner

Our investments are more impactful as a result of partnerships with organizations that have a proven track record for delivering results. 3M salutes our community partners for their commitment to improving lives in so many incredible ways.









































          
	3M supports the National Museum of African American History and Culture

      





The National Museum of African American History and Culture commemorates the African American experience as seen through the eyes of those who lived it. Established by an Act of Congress in 2003, the NMAAHC counts more than 36,000 artifacts in its extensive collection. 3M is proud to be a cornerstone donor to this important institution on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. As NMAAHC founding director Lonnie G. Bunch III so eloquently put it: “There are few things as powerful and as important as a people, as a nation that is steeped in its history.” The Museum opens on September 24.










          
	Building community through the time and talent of our people.

      
3Mers love making a difference—especially when they can apply science and innovation to change lives. We’re proud of their efforts and encourage them to improve lives in their communities.











            *3M Marks its 3rd Annual Global Volunteer Day
            

More than 100 3M volunteers from the company's service center in San Jose, Costa Rica revitalized a playground for students at a local school.
