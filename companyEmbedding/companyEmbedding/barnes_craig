Overview



Alcoholic Private Investigator, Drew Schweitzer, is hired to aid the police in a missing persons case by the parents of a terminally ill little girl, Abby Deirdre, who disappeared from the hospital a month earlier. Unsure if the child is still alive, the PI finds himself in a race against time to find her before her condition worsens or at least find the people who took her.With every new discovery, it seems that Abby's disappearance may be linked to something worse. Something sinister. Something evil. Something iniquitous.

Meet the Author



Craig R. Key was born in Fort Worth, Texas on December 7, 1983. Starting with drama courses in high school and moving on to larger college productions, he knew that his love for entertaining was beyond the simple stage and he began to branch out into screenwriting and filmmaking.Craig's first venture into epic storytelling on a micro-budget began with a three-episode web series titled "The Clay Chronicles" that was produced under his self-funded production company Floor 13 Productions from 2003 to 2006. After the completion of the series, he went on to write additional short films from 2007 to 2012 including a handful of sketches for Floaters Comedy from Bad Apple Studios. His titles during production have included director, writer, actor, editor, and he has even written music for his projects.On July 13, 2014, Craig completed his first novel, a dark fantasy titled, "A Sight Unseen," which he dedicated to his father Gary Key, who lost his battle with cancer on May 1, 2014. Almost a year later, Craig released his second book, a comedy/drama titled, "Counting Losses," on May 21, 2015. This one was dedicated to everyone who, like the author, suffers from clinical anxiety and/or depression.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Jesus once said, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty." So why are Christians still thirsty? We throw ourselves into church work, Bible studies, prayer, missions, fellowship. Yet still we search restlessly for something more. What are we missing?Perhaps the answer is, more of Jesus. Church meetings and programs, ministry, Christian counseling, and home groups are all good, but they are not him. It doesn't matter how devoted we are to these wonderful activities; they are not the same thing as communion with Jesus. Our souls crave him alone.In Sacred Thirst, author and pastor Craig Barnes brings us face-to-face with our desperate longing for God. Like the woman at the well, we have tried to satisfy our parched souls with so many other thingseven religious things. But when we get to the bottom of our desire, we find Jesus quietly waiting with his living waterintimatecommunion with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.This book is filled with unique insights into human experience and the character of God. With his keen understanding of the needs of contemporary Christians, Barnes points to the only way our thirst will ever be satisfied. Drawing from his rich background in the Bible and his tender insights as a pastor, he leads us into a new understanding ofourselves and the uncontrollable but gracious God we seek.


Author Bio▼▲
       M. Craig Barnes is pastor of Shadyside Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His previous books are Yearning, Hustling God, and When God Interrupts. 

Publisher's Weekly▼▲
In this deep, inspiring book, Barnes plays with biblical images of deserts, 
flowing streams and living waters, applying them to contemporary life. He says 
that he wrote the book especially for Christians who find themselves in a 
spiritual desert with a sense of "soul sadness" or spiritual loneliness, having 
lost the astonishment and joy of their faith. Barnes, senior pastor of National 
Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., notes that in the Old and New 
Testaments, characters from the patriarchs to Jesus used such desert 
experiences as metaphors for pilgrimage toward God. Today's Christians can use 
their spiritual deserts toward that same end, seeking God's flowing streams of 
mercy to sustain and refresh them as they journey to the Promised Land. Barnes 
cautions that often Christians mistake their intellectual knowledge, prayers, 
church attendance and good works as replacements for God; he claims that making 
idols of these activities creates a sense of dissatisfaction and a longing for 
more. Often Christians settle for the desert, but Barnes says that "sacred 
thirst" can call them from barren spirituality to embrace the holy joy of God. 
Just as Jesus told the Samaritan woman at the well that he could give her 
living waters and she would never thirst, so he promises contemporary followers 
that the Holy Spirit is the living water that restores parched souls. Barnes's 
powerful and beautifully written book is a balm to the weary pilgrim. (Jan.)

                This review was written for Sacred Thirst: Meeting God in the Desert of Our Longings.
            
 
            I keep reading and rereading Barnes books. He artfully explains how our relationship with our God although simple, is not to be trivialized by our efforts, our understanding or even our faith.  As I read his books I am reminded and grateful for the mystery of God, the power of His Spirit and the transcendent viewpoint of 2 Cor 5:14.  For as we follow the author of life on our bewildering journeys, He leads us to recognize that it is only the magnetic pull of Christs love that compels us.

Product Description▼▲
Though many ancient confessions of faith have emerged throughout the church's history, perhaps one of the most widely accepted, comprehensive, and uniquely personal, is the Heidelberg Catechism. In this groundbreaking book, Body and Soul, theologian, pastor and popular author M. Craig Barnes reveals the Heidelberg Catechism's true identity.With profound insight, clarity and a great deal of wonder, Barnes' reclaiming of the Heidelberg reveals the beauty and relevance of this 16th century statement of faith. It's not a list of doctrinal questions and answers. It's not a cut-and-dried summary of what Christians believe. It's a deeply personal statement of faith and a surprisingly contemporary guide for everyday life.Reflecting much of its primary author's own theological convictions that were firmly Protestant with Calvinistic leanings, the Heidelberg holds fast the fundamental teaching that man's salvation includes both body and soul. Body and Soul serves as a reliable and inspiring companion in a world where faith and doubt coexist. From the seasoned pastor, theologian or believer to the seeker or newcomer to the body of Christ, Barnes invites you to join him in finding comfort in belonging, body and soul, to the triune God.

            We used the book Body and Soul as the basis for our Lenten studies in a variety of settings. The response from the congregation has been overwhelmingly positive. It is a simple book but thought provoking and allows ample opportunity for the reader to dig deeper into the catechism and the scriptures.

What Makes Craig Deliberately Different
Throughout his career, Craig has modeled his practice after our 16th president. These attributes include honesty in all of his dealings, whether they are with clients, colleagues or the court, tenacity in seeking the best result for his clients and civility toward everyone. In the same spirit as Lincoln, Craig brings the energy, vision and strategic thinking necessary to prevail, regardless the complexity or demands of the case. He also has distinguished himself by developing a team of lawyers at the firm who have supported his practice, with several going on to become successful trial lawyers in their own right. 



Overview
Overview
Experience
Credentials



Craig Barnes is the former managing partner of Sedgwick’s Los Angeles office. He is an active trial lawyer who practices in the area of catastrophic loss litigation, including child sexual abuse, brain injury and other major injury cases, complex business litigation, product liability and general tort litigation.
With more than 25 trials in his career, Craig has won many defense verdicts on behalf of his clients, saving them millions of dollars. His defense verdicts include a Los Angeles jury trial in a child sexual abuse case where the plaintiff sought $9 million, a San Luis Obispo jury verdict on a major injury claim where the plaintiff sought $10 million at trial, and a Compton jury trial brought by a wheelchair-bound plaintiff who sought damages of $1.7 million.


Representative Matters
Craig’s trials include: 

Paula Hall v. National Home Improvement Retailer (12-0 Verdict)

Plaintiff, an insulin-dependent diabetic, claimed she was seriously injured by a dangerous condition on defendant’s premises. As a result of the incident, plaintiff claimed that she would likely require amputation of part of her left leg. Defendant argued that a reasonably careful person with plaintiff’s disabilities, i.e., diabetic retinopathy (loss of vision) and diabetic neuropathy (loss of sensation), would have been more careful under the circumstances. The liability and damages phases were bifurcated. Plaintiff demanded $6 million before trial, and indicated that, if the case proceeded to the damages phase, she would request that the jury return a $10 million verdict. The jury returned a 12-0 verdict for the defense the day after closing arguments. 

Oscar Humphrey v. National Home Improvement Retailer (12-0 Verdict)

Plaintiff claimed he was injured by a dangerous condition on defendant’s premises. The case was tried on theories of general negligence and premises liability. Plaintiff argued that, as a result of the incident, he suffered severe back injuries and would never be able to walk again. Plaintiff sat through the entire trial in a wheelchair. Plaintiff demanded $1.7 million before trial. After only a half hour of deliberation, the jury returned a 12-0 defense verdict.

Emily Hetrick v. King Hong (11-1 Verdict)

Plaintiff alleged that she suffered brain damage when she fell back in a chair and struck her head on a cement surface. She claimed the chair was defectively designed, manufactured and negligently maintained. Plaintiff asked the jury to award $22.5 million. The jury returned an 11-1 defense verdict in favor of our client on the ground that plaintiff failed to prove that the maintenance of the chair caused her accident.

Lady Wautausa Je v. Hollywood Entertainment District (12-0 Verdict)

Plaintiff sued for intentional interference with economic advantage and business and professions code violations arising from her arrest and detention by security officers retained by the Hollywood Entertainment District. Plaintiff was engaged in selling celebrity photographs on the street, in violation of a local ordinance. Plaintiff alleged that her three-hour detention and the physical and psychological abuse she allegedly suffered was done with the intention of driving her out of business. A 12-0 defense verdict was obtained on behalf of the client. 

CTSI v. MWD (12-0 Verdict)

In a case where Sedgwick represented the plaintiff/cross-defendant, plaintiff alleged defendant municipal water district breached a $1.2 million contract for the distribution of toilets throughout Southern California. The defendant cross-complained for $1.2 million in alleged overpayments and retained inventory. Although there was no written contract, as required for all government contracts, we were able establish that signed letters from defendant were sufficient writings to give rise to a contract. The jury returned a 12-0 verdict for the client for breach of contract.
