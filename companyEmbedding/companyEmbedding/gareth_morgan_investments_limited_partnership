Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for BPC Acquisition Corp (NYSE:BERY) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.73)Consensus Price Target: $61.13 (9.09% upside)

We focus on what we’re good at.
Protecting and enhancing the wealth of New Zealanders and we have a long track record in investment management.






















About us
We are a 100% New Zealand owned and operated, investment management business, helping Kiwis save and invest through our KiwiSaver scheme, Superannuation scheme and our Private Portfolio Service.





















Begun around a kitchen table...
We started as Gareth Morgan Investments (GMI), founded by economists Dr. Gareth Morgan and Andrew Gawith in August 2000. The investment management company grew quickly, providing access to global investments and easy to understand, transparent reporting to rival the investment industry in New Zealand. 












Growth and changes...
In 2007, a KiwiSaver scheme was introduced to the product stable (then named the ‘Gareth Morgan KiwiSaver Scheme’), which now has more than 180,000 members and more than $3 billion of funds under management. GMI and its subsidiaries were sold to Kiwi Wealth Management Limited, which is part of the Kiwi Group Holdings Limited (KGHL) and a subsidiary of New Zealand Post, in March 2012. 
A partial sale of KGHL to the NZ Super Fund and the Accident Compensation Corporation occurred in October 2016. New Zealand Post retains a majority share in KGHL.






But some things stay the same...
Fierce commitment to transparency, accountability and understandable reporting for our customers, continues to be the heart of the business and the decisions we make and what we are recognised for.
























Meet our Team
It’s the people in any business that can really set it apart. We have a unique culture that empowers creativity and challenges the ‘status quo’ and we hire people who share these values to provide the best experience for our customers. 




















Board & Senior ManagementOur Directors oversee the business operations and provide support and guidance to the Senior Management Team.
Investment ManagersThe team has extensive experience and a strong track record in managing global and local investments.
AdvisersAll our advisers are Authorised Financial Advisers (AFAs) who can provide a range of investment advice.
