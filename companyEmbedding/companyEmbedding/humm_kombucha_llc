Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Review: Humm Kombucha’s Seasonal Hopped Grapefruit

            Posted: Jul 25, 2017 at 6:07 PM (Last Updated: Jul 26, 2017 at 5:41 PM)
            






Covers Products: Hopped Grapefruit

Humm’s seasonal offering for Summer 2017 is this product, a 14 percent juice-based kombucha that blends their kombucha with grapefruit juice (along with apple, pear, grape, and orange) and hops to create something that’s quite enjoyable.Using Cascade and Citra hops, the product has notes of pine and citrus with a slightly bitter finish that will be familiar to anyone that has ever had an IPA. While we’ve had other hopped kombuchas, Humm has executed this product in a way that’s a step above what we’ve had in the past. Specifically, Humm’s use of sweet, bitter, and citrus components works extremely well with the effervescent and slightly fermented tea flavor that’s the base of the product. It’s complex, but really well balanced, and it has a flavor profile that feels more sophisticated than some of the more common kombucha flavors on the market today.Visually, we’re big fans of the proprietary 14 oz. glass bottle that Humm uses across their line. The label has a whimsical background that’s loaded with illustrations. It doesn’t give a direct nod to the flavor of the liquid inside the bottle, but the copy, which contains only five words on the front of the label, is easy to read and intuitive to the point where we don’t feel that images of hops or grapefruit are really necessary. The concept of a seasonal flavor, which is something that’s being used almost universally in the kombucha category, is something that seems smart, especially in that it allows the company to have something “new” every once in a while. That being said, a Hopped Grapefruit offering feels like a good fit as the draw for it probably isn’t going to be as broad as some of their simpler and more common flavors. Overall, Humm has done a superb job with this product. For a company that’s largely going after conventional retail, it’s great to see that they’re willing to create innovative flavors that are a bit outside the box. And in the case of Hopped Grapefruit, we think they’ve nailed it on the execution front.

Keep doing what you guys do and thank you for the best kombucha ever!” –Love and good vibes, Jordan       Send us a message Request a donation Join Our Blogletter              Do You Thirst for Adventure? | Humm Kombucha                                                          Do You Thirst for Adventure?Discovering New Adventures What does the word “adventure” mean to you? Does it summon images of death-defying leaps from mountains or planes? Perhaps it musters visions of a road trip to places you’ve never been, or starting your new dream business.For some of us, “adventure” may bring to mind the idea of learning a new language, instrument or skill. For others, it conjures thoughts of trekking to a foreign land, eating exotic foods and meeting new people. And for some, the word adventure makes you imagine falling crazy in love.In film and literature, an adventure typically involves great peril and terrifying scenarios from which the hero must escape. Who hasn’t pictured themselves as Indiana Jones, racing through the jungle with a massive boulder crashing around his feet? Our earliest stories were adventures; sacred fairytales told around fires about heroes and gods, demons and dragons.Then as now, the dragons served as metaphors for the great challenges of life, the very real fears we all face. The myths of each tribe gave purpose to their existence, a pride in their people and an example of valor and bravery.What Does Adventure Mean in a Modern World?Today people are far more digital and removed from physical reality, which offers less exciting dragons and more common, perhaps boring, demons like the DMV or the cable company.It is time to seek out your own adventures!Here in Bend, Ore. we’re fortunate to have ample opportunity to do just that. Towering snow-topped mountains are the playground of extreme athletes, weekend warriors and sled-dragging children alike. Rivers and lakes provide adventures both exciting and serene. Vast forests offer a glimpse into the world of our ancient forebears, for whom each day was an adventure in survival and discovery.Join the adrenaline junkies equipped with snowboards, skis, crampons and bikes, all the trekkers who thrive here, each carving their own course through an adventurous life.What Does Quenching a Mad Thirst for Adventure Mean to You?Adventure, as we’ve established, is a broad term. For each person seeking a personal best velocity, there’s another walking on stage for the first time, or trying a new fashion accessory to see if they can pull it off. But as broad and varied as our adventures may be, there are some universal commonalities.In adventure, we expand ourselves and glimpse what we’re made of. We put ourselves out there to sink or swim, hold up life’s mirror and say sincerely, “I tried.” We feel present. We feel alive.On the Humm website, we ask our visitors the question, “Do you thirst for adventure?” We’re asking you to undertake a tiny adventure and try what may seem a strange and unfamiliar beverage at first. We also want you to join us in the grand adventure that is life, so that you too may feel the vibrations of Humm.An adventure starts with humble roots and grand aspirations.So run wildly, seek your own adventure. Write your story. Push your boundaries. Remember the words of Helen Keller, who wrote, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” Drink deeply of life each day, even if it’s just a small sip of kombucha tea.Comments  Previous Post Next Post  Send us a message Request a donation Join Our Blogletter              Our Kombucha | Humm Kombucha                                                         Our KombuchaWhat Is Kombucha?How We Brew KombuchaKombucha on DraftOur Kombucha  ◀Hopped Grapefruit Calories 50  Sugar 10gPer 8 ounce serving Hops: not just for beer anymore  ►  ◀Blueberry Mint Calories 40  Sugar 6gPer 8 ounce serving Whaaat?
