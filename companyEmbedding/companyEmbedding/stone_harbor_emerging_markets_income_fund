Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

2The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index consists of the following 23 emerging market country indices: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
        The MSCI Emerging Markets Investment Market Index (MSCI EM IMI) is a free float adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to capture large-, mid- and small-cap representation across 23 emerging markets countries. Emerging Markets countries include: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Qatar, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

The Distribution Rate on Market Price is based on the Fund's current annualized monthly distribution divided by the Fund's current market price. Sources of distributions to shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a Section 19(a) notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time, available at www.shiplpcef.com.  These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year's distributions) contained in shareholders' 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. Distribution payments are not guaranteed; distribution rates will vary and you should not draw any conclusions about the fund's past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.For more complete information about the Funds, see the Emerging Markets Income Fund Annual

Stone Harbor Emerging Markets Total Income Fund | EDI






EDI's Objective?
The Fund's investment objective is to maximize total return, which consists of income and capital appreciation from investments in emerging markets securities. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund normally will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes) in Emerging Markets Debt. "Emerging Markets Debt" includes fixed income securities and other instruments (including derivatives) that are economically tied to emerging market countries, that are denominated in the predominant currency of the local market of an emerging market country or whose performance is linked or otherwise related to those countries' markets, currencies, economies or ability to repay loans. The Fund normally expects to invest up to 20% of its total assets in Emerging Markets Equity. "Emerging Markets Equity" includes securities issued by either single country or regional exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"), common stocks, preferred stocks, other equity securities and other instruments (including derivatives) that are economically tied to the equity markets of emerging market countries, 
that are denominated in the predominant currency of the local market of an emerging market country or whose performance is linked or otherwise related to those countries' markets, currencies, or economies. The Investment Manager does not have an established performance record investing in equity securities.
Structure

Managed portfolio of emerging markets debt combined with an ability to invest in emerging markets equity, structured to maximize total return

Benefits

Attractive income and total return potential versus traditional single sector emerging markets debt and equity portfolios
Ability to allocate tactically to emerging markets equity to take advantage of opportunities
Potential for low correlation with traditional fixed income portfolios
Potentially competitive risk/return portfolio profile versus many other types of fixed income portfolios

Stone Harbor Investment Partners LP
 

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. An investor should consider, among other things, the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.
Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or even all of your investment. Therefore, before investing you should consider carefully, among other things, the Fund's investment objective, charges and expenses, and the risks that you will assume if you invest in the Fund's common shares.
THE FUND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS ONLY ONE ELEMENT OF A COMPLETE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. AN INVESTMENT IN THIS FUND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SPECULATIVE. CLOSED-END FUNDS FREQUENTLY TRADE AT A DISCOUNT TO THEIR NET ASSET VALUES.
The Distribution Rate on Market Price is based on the Fund's current annualized monthly distribution divided by the Fund's current market price. Sources of distributions to shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a Section 19(a) notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time, available at www.shiplpcef.com.  These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year's distributions) contained in shareholders' 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. Distribution payments are not guaranteed; distribution rates will vary and you should not draw any conclusions about the fund's past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.For more complete information about the Funds, see the Emerging Markets Income Fund Annual
or the Emerging Markets Income Fund Semi-Annual
and the Emerging Markets Total Income Fund Annual
or the Emerging Markets Total Income Fund Semi-Annual
 or call your financial professional or 1-877-206-0791. Read the Emerging Markets Income Fund Annual
or the Emerging Markets Income Fund Semi-Annual
and the Emerging Markets Total Income Fund Annual
or the Emerging Markets Total Income Fund Semi-Annual
 carefully before you invest or send money.

The Fund normally expects to invest up to 20% of its total assets in Emerging Markets Equity. "Emerging Markets Equity" includes securities issued by either single country or regional exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"), common stocks, preferred stocks, other equity securities and other instruments (including derivatives) that are economically tied to the equity markets of emerging market countries, 
that are denominated in the predominant currency of the local market of an emerging market country or whose performance is linked or otherwise related to those countries' markets, currencies, or economies.

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. An investor should consider, among other things, the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.
Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or even all of your investment. Therefore, before investing you should consider carefully, among other things, the Fund's investment objective, charges and expenses, and the risks that you will assume if you invest in the Fund's common shares.
THE FUND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS ONLY ONE ELEMENT OF A COMPLETE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. AN INVESTMENT IN THIS FUND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SPECULATIVE. CLOSED-END FUNDS FREQUENTLY TRADE AT A DISCOUNT TO THEIR NET ASSET VALUES.
The Distribution Rate on Market Price is based on the Fund's current annualized monthly distribution divided by the Fund's current market price. Sources of distributions to shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a Section 19(a) notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time, available at www.shiplpcef.com.  These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year's distributions) contained in shareholders' 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. Distribution payments are not guaranteed; distribution rates will vary and you should not draw any conclusions about the fund's past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.For more complete information about the Funds, see the Emerging Markets Income Fund Annual

 Stone Harbor Emerging Markets Income Fund | EDF






EDF's Objective?
The Fund's primary investment objective is to maximize total return, which consists of income on its investments and capital appreciation. The Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings made for investment purposes) in Emerging Markets Securities. "Emerging Markets Securities" include fixed income securities and other instruments (including derivatives) that are economically tied to emerging market countries, that are denominated in the predominant currency of the local market of an emerging market country or whose performance is linked to those countries' markets, currencies, economies or ability to repay loans. A security or instrument is economically tied to an emerging market country if it is principally traded on the country's securities markets or if the issuer is organized or principally operates in the country, derives a majority of its income from its operations within the country or has a majority of its assets within the country. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
Structure

Managed portfolio of emerging markets fixed income securities
Structured to maximize total return and high current income
Flexible asset allocation

Benefits

Enhanced return potential versus traditional single sector emerging markets debt portfolios
Attractive total return and income potential with the possibility to diversify versus U.S. Dollar denominated assets

1.77%







The Fund normally will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in Emerging Markets Securities. Emerging Markets Securities include fixed income securities and other instruments (including derivatives) that are economically tied to emerging market countries, that are denominated in the predominant currency of the local market of an emerging market country or whose performance is linked to those countries markets, currencies, economies or ability to repay loans. A security or instrument is economically tied to an emerging market country if it is principally traded on the countrys securities markets or if the issuer is organized or principally operates in the country, derives a majority of its income from its operations within the country or has a majority of its assets within the country. The Fund may use derivatives to a significant extent for hedging, investment or leverage purposes. Although Emerging Markets Securities may include any derivative or other instrument that provides the Fund exposure to emerging markets, the Fund currently expects that its derivatives transactions or instruments will consist primarily of the following instruments and transactions: credit linked notes, foreign currency forward contracts, credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, total return swaps on individual securities and groups or indices of securities, and interest rate futures contracts and options. The Fund may use these instruments for hedging purposes, for leverage or otherwise to gain, or reduce, long or short exposure to emerging securities markets (for example, credit linked notes may be used to gain exposure to certain emerging markets fixed income securities). Emerging Markets Securities may be denominated in non-U.S. currencies or the U.S. dollar. The Fund may use derivatives to a significant extent.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
