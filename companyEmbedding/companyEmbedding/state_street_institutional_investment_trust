Our Story


 




Our clients are looking to the future. We’re helping them get there.
We are the engine that powers the world’s investments. We hold and manage money for millions of people: our clients and their clients. We’re responsible for 11 percent* of the world’s assets.
Our clients face big challenges. Risk. Regulation. Complexity. It’s those challenges that inspire our solutions. Systems to improve efficiency. Tools that turn data into insight. Research that shapes strategies.
Large enough to serve more than 100 markets, we’re local enough to deliver on the ground. This means we’re closer to the world’s investments; closer to the communities where we operate; and closer to the clients we serve.
*State Street and McKinsey Global Institute, Global Capital Markets, June 30, 2015

State Street and State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) do not conduct job interviews via non-State Street email, instant messaging or chat rooms.

These scams usually have one of more of the following characteristics:

They attempt first contact via email from a public domain or via a text message.
They attempt to perform an online interview via common web services.
They may impersonate State Street or SSGA individuals during the process.
They may send a check and ask for the funds to be deposited and wired to another location for the purchase of home office equipment.
They may use the State Street or SSGA trademark and logo in the process.

If you have been contacted under these circumstances please report the activity to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, which is a partnership among the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BIA), at www.ic3.gov.

Fund performance in the Management Discussion of Fund Performance section. We note that all other Funds in the Shareholder Reports discuss derivative usage in this section. 
Response: Consistent with Item 27(b), Instruction 7(i), of Form N-1A, in future reports, the Fund will discuss the
Funds use of derivatives and impact on Fund performance to the extent its use of derivatives materially affected the Funds performance during its most recently completed reporting period.

Small/Mid Cap Equity Index Fund  
Class A (SSMJX) Class I (SSMLX) Class K (SSMKX)
Summary Prospectus – May 1, 2017



Before
 you invest, you may want to review the fund's prospectus, which contains more information about the fund and its risks. You may find the fund's prospectus and other information about the fund online at: 

http://www.ssgafunds.com
 

You
 may also get this information at no cost by calling (800) 997-7327, by sending an e-mail request to Fund_Inquiry@ssga.com, or by writing to the fund, c/o State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC, State Street Financial Center, One
Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111-2900. The fund's current prospectus and statement of additional information are incorporated by reference into this summary prospectus.  
Investment Objective
The State Street Small/Mid Cap Equity Index
Fund (the “Small/Mid Cap Equity Index Fund” or the “Fund”) seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the total return of an index that tracks the performance of mid-to small-
capitalization exchange traded U.S. equity securities.
Fees and Expenses of the Fund
The tables below describe the fees and
expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund (“Fund Shares”). You may qualify for sales charge discounts on purchases of Class A shares if you agree to invest in the future, or if you and your family currently invest,
at least $50,000 in State Street Funds that offer Class A shares. More information about these and other discounts is available from your financial professional and in Choosing a Share Class – Reducing Your Class A Sales Charge on page 66
of the Fund's Prospectus. The expenses shown in the table and the Example reflect the expenses of both the Fund and the Fund's proportionate share of the expenses of State Street Small/Mid Cap Equity Index Portfolio (the “Small/Mid
Cap Equity Index Portfolio” or sometimes referred to in context as the “Portfolio”).

The Fund's
investment adviser, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (the “Adviser” or “SSGA FM”), is contractually obligated until April 30, 2018 (i) to waive up to the full amount of the advisory fee payable by the Fund, and/or (ii) to
reimburse the Fund for expenses to the extent that Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (exclusive of non-recurring account fees, extraordinary expenses, acquired fund fees, and any class-specific expenses, such as distribution, shareholder
servicing, sub-transfer agency and administration fees) exceed 0.03% of average daily net assets on an annual basis. This waiver and/or reimbursement may not be terminated prior to April 30, 2018 except with approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees.
  Example:
This Example is intended to help you
compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated, and then sell all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods.
The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. The calculation of costs for the one-year period takes into account the effect of any current contractual fee waivers
and/or reimbursements; and the calculation of costs for the remaining periods takes such fee waivers and/or reimbursements into account only for the first year of each such period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these
assumptions your costs would be:

   Portfolio Turnover:
The Fund pays transaction costs, such as
commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). As a shareholder of the Small/Mid Cap Equity Index Portfolio, the Fund bears its ratable share of the transaction costs associated with
the portfolio turnover of the Portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund
Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance.  During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 21% of the average value of its portfolio.
Principal Investment Strategies
The Fund uses a passive management strategy
designed to track the performance of the Russell Small Cap Completeness Index (the “Index”). The Index is a float-adjusted, market capitalization index which measures the performance of the Russell 3000® Index companies excluding S&P 500®
constituents. The Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer of the extended broad market beyond the S&P 500 exposure. As of February 28, 2017, the market capitalization of the companies included in the Index ranged
from $7.74 million to $30.98 billion. As of February 28, 2017, the Index comprised 2,456 securities. As of February 28, 2017, a significant portion of the Index comprised companies in the financial, health care and consumer discretionary sectors,
although this may change from time to time.
The Fund is not managed according to
traditional methods of “active” investment management, which involve the buying and selling of securities based upon economic, financial and market analysis and investment judgment. Instead, the Fund, using a
“passive” or “indexing” investment approach, seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the total return of the Index.
The Fund generally intends to invest in
all stocks comprising the Index in approximate proportion to their weightings in the Index. However, under various circumstances, it may not be possible or practicable to purchase all stocks in those weightings. In those circumstances, the Fund may
purchase a sample of the stocks in the Index in proportions expected by SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (“SSGA FM” or the “Adviser”), the investment adviser to the Fund, to match generally the performance of the Index as a
whole. In addition, from time to time stocks are added to or removed from the Index. The Fund may sell securities that are represented in the Index, or purchase securities that are not yet represented in the Index, in anticipation of their removal
from or addition to the Index. Under normal market conditions, the Portfolio invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings, if any) in stocks in the Index. The Fund will provide shareholders with at least sixty (60) days' notice prior to
any change in this 80% investment policy. The notional value of the Fund's investments in derivatives or other synthetic instruments that provide exposures comparable, in the judgment of the Adviser, to investments in the Index may be counted toward
satisfaction of this 80% policy.  
2 
    

In addition, the Fund may purchase or sell
futures contracts on the Index, or options on those futures, in lieu of investing directly in the stocks making up the Index. The Fund might do so, for example, in order to increase its investment exposure pending investment of cash in the stocks
comprising the Index. Alternatively, the Fund might use futures or options on futures to reduce its investment exposure in situations where it intends to sell a portion of the stocks in its portfolio but the sale has not yet been completed. The Fund
may also enter into other derivatives transactions, including the use of options or swap transactions relating to the Index or any securities comprising the Index, in lieu of investing directly in the stocks making up the Index. The Fund may, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, invest in shares of other mutual funds whose investment objectives and policies are similar to those of the Fund (including funds advised by the Adviser).
The Fund seeks to achieve its investment
objective by investing substantially all of its investable assets in the State Street Small/Mid Cap Equity Index Portfolio, a separate series of the State Street Institutional Investment Trust, with an identical investment objective as the Fund and
that has substantially identical investment policies, strategies and risks, to the Fund. When the Fund invests in this “master-feeder” structure, the Fund's only investments are shares of the Portfolio and it participates in the
investment returns achieved by the Portfolio.
The Index is sponsored by Frank Russell
Company (the “Index Provider”), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the Index and publishes information regarding the
market value of the Index. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and you could lose money, possibly your entire investment, by investing in the Fund.
Principal Risks
You could lose money by investing in the
Fund. An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks, including possible loss of principal, is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any
other government agency. The Fund may not achieve its investment objective. General risks associated with the Fund's and the Portfolio's investment policies and investment strategies are discussed below. The Fund is not intended to be a
complete investment program, but rather is intended for investment as part of a diversified investment portfolio. Investors should consult their own advisers as to the role of the Fund in their overall investment programs.
In addition, the Fund is subject to the
following risks:
Consumer Discretionary
Sector Risk: The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of the overall global economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. Success depends heavily
on disposable household income and consumer spending. Also, companies in the consumer discretionary sector may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their respective profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer
tastes can also affect the demand for, and success of, consumer products and services in the marketplace.
Counterparty Risk: The Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties with which the Fund enters into derivatives contracts, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and other transactions. If a
counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, the Fund may be unable to terminate or realize any gain on the investment or transaction, or to recover collateral posted to the counterparty, resulting in a loss to the Fund. If the Fund holds
collateral posted by its counterparty, it may be delayed or prevented from realizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding relating to the counterparty.
Derivatives Risk: Derivative transactions can create investment leverage and may have significant volatility. It is possible that a derivative transaction will result in a much greater loss than the principal amount invested, and the
Fund may not be able to close out a derivative transaction at a favorable time or price. The counterparty to a derivatives contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise honor its
obligations. A derivatives transaction may not behave in the manner anticipated by the Adviser or may not have the effect on the Fund anticipated by the Adviser.
Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that may directly relate to the issuer and also
may decline due to general industry or market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of
time.
Financial Sector Risk: Financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation which may limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, the interest rates and fees they can
charge, the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates
change or due to increased  
3 
    

competition. In addition, deterioration
of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial institutions and markets. Certain
events in the financial sector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain financial services companies to incur large losses. Securities of financial services companies may
experience a dramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the valuations of their assets, take action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses
resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated with investment activities can negatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be subject to severe price competition. Adverse economic, business or political
developments could adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value of real estate.
Health Care Sector Risk: Companies in the health care sector are subject to extensive government regulation and their profitability can be significantly affected by restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of
medical products and services, pricing pressure (including price discounting), limited product lines and an increased emphasis on the delivery of healthcare through outpatient services. Companies in the health care sector are heavily dependent on
obtaining and defending patents, which may be time consuming and costly, and the expiration of patents may also adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Health care companies are also subject to extensive litigation based on product
liability and similar claims. In addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. Many new products in the health care sector require significant research and development
and may be subject to regulatory approvals, all of which may be time consuming and costly with no guarantee that any product will come to market.
Index Tracking Risk: While the Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high degree of correlation with the
Index), the Fund's return may not match the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. In addition, the Fund may not be fully invested at times,
generally as a result of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to replicate the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the Index, or in some
securities not included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return and that of the Index.
Large Shareholder Risk: To the extent a large proportion of the shares of the Portfolio are held by a small number of shareholders (or a single shareholder), including funds or accounts over which the Adviser has investment discretion, the
Portfolio is subject to the risk that these shareholders will purchase or redeem Portfolio shares in large amounts rapidly or unexpectedly, including as a result of an asset allocation decision made by the Adviser. These transactions could adversely
affect the ability of the Portfolio to conduct its investment program.
Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market or restrictions on resale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid securities may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid
investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may limit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to limitations on investments
in any illiquid securities and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such investments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain market or sector.
Master/Feeder Structure
Risk: The Fund pursues its objective by investing substantially all of its assets in another pooled investment vehicle (a “master fund”). The ability of the Fund to meet its investment objective is
directly related to the ability of the master fund to meet its investment objective. The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the master fund, leading to potential conflicts of interest. The Fund will bear its pro rata portion of the expenses
incurred by the master fund. Substantial redemptions by other investors in a master fund may affect the master fund's investment program adversely and limit the ability of the master fund to achieve its objective.
Passive Strategy/Index
Risk: The Fund is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of the actual
securities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment
strategy. The structure and composition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.
Risk of Investment in
Other Pools: If the Fund invests in another pooled investment vehicle, it is exposed to the risk that the other pool will not perform as expected and is exposed indirectly to all of the risks applicable to an
investment in such other pool. The investment policies of the other pool may not be the same as those of the Fund; as a result, an investment in the other   

4 
    

pool may be subject to additional or
different risks than those to which the Fund is typically subject. The Fund bears its proportionate share of the fees and expenses of any pool in which it invests. The Adviser or an affiliate may serve as investment adviser to a pool in which the
Fund may invest, leading to potential conflicts of interest. It is possible that other clients of the Adviser or its affiliates will purchase or sell interests in a pool sponsored or managed by the Adviser or its affiliates at prices and at times
more favorable than those at which the Fund does so.
Small- and
Mid-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities of small- and mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may involve more risk than the securities of larger companies. These companies may have limited
product lines, markets or financial resources, may lack the competitive strength of larger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In addition, these companies may have been recently organized and may have little or no track record of
success. The securities of smaller companies may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Some securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may be restricted as to resale, and their values may have
significant volatility. The Fund may be unable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations. Returns on investments in securities of small- and mid-capitalization
companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of larger companies.
Unconstrained Sector
Risk: The Fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within one or more economic sectors or industries, which may change from time to time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or industries
increases the potential for volatility and the risk that events negatively affecting such sectors or industries could reduce returns, potentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps significantly.
Valuation Risk: Some portfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of the Fund's investment portfolio, may be valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced
liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market quotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ from what would be produced using a
different methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including “fair valued” securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in
their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the
Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that time. Investors who purchase or redeem Fund Shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued investments may
receive fewer or more shares or lower or higher redemption proceeds than they would have received if the Fund had not fair-valued the holding(s) or had used a different valuation methodology.

Tax Information
The Fund's distributions are expected to be

arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to
Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
If you purchase Fund Shares through a
broker-dealer or other Financial Intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the Financial Intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development
of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend
the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your Financial Intermediary's website for more information.
