			Mr. Ehren was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Company in May 2012. While at Key, Mr. Ehren has held the following positions: Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (December 2011 to May 2012), Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (February 2008 to May 2012), and Senior Vice President of Global Operations (2010 and 2011). From 2004 to 2008, he served as Vice President of Global Operations of Planar Systems, Inc., a public company that provides flat panel display and system solutions for medical, transportation, industrial and retail applications. From 1997 to 2004, Mr. Ehren held several senior-level financial officer positions with Planar, including Corporate Controller and Treasurer. Between 1990 and 1997, he held Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance and Operations positions with two privately-held manufacturing companies. Mr. Ehren was employed by Ernst & Young, a public accounting firm, from 1985 to 1990, working primarily with high technology, manufacturing and software development clients.
The Board has concluded that Mr. Ehren should continue to serve as a director of Key based on the following primary qualifications:

.Extensive knowledge of Key's business-Since joining the company in 2008, until his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ehren held the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer while also taking on additional responsibilities related to Global Operations, European Operations, and business unit General Manager. Further, in 2011, Mr. Ehren was appointed as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer with management responsibilities for all aspects of our business.  This extensive exposure to every aspect of Key's business uniquely qualifies Mr. Ehren for his service as a director.

.Relevant Chief Executive Officer/President experience-In addition to his current responsibilities at Key, Mr. Ehren held various senior vice president positions for high technology manufacturing companies where he had domestic and international operations and overall business responsibilities.  This experience provides Mr. Ehren with the relevant background that is critical for his current role as a director of Key.

.High level of financial literacy-Throughout his career, Mr. Ehren has held multiple chief financial officer positions and other financial officer positions with various companies. This experience with the financial operations of both Key and other companies uniquely positions Mr. Ehren to provide financially sound guidance in his role as a director.

.Extensive knowledge in global operations. Mr. Ehren's key role in globalizing the Company and his past experience in global operations provides the Board with broad expertise in international financial and operational issues that effect the Company.

We appreciate David's many accomplishments. With Jack's skills and experience and his dedication to continuous improvement, we are confident the company will continue to excel.”
