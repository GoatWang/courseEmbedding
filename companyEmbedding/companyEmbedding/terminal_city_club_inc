 Corporate Membership
 Personal Membership
 Non-Profit Membership
 

Corporate Memberships
Whether you’re bonding over a business lunch with coworkers or utilizing one of our private meeting rooms, a Corporate Membership is the ideal solution for combining work and play. A corporate membership is owned by a company, which can elect one individual to represent the membership. Should the elected nominee resign or retire, the membership would stay with the company, which, for a small fee, can then transfer it to a different employee.
Club Membership Industry Mix

Corporate memberships make an excellent incentive for high-performing employees, a great reward for long-serving faithful employees, or a creative way to attract highly-skilled potential employees.
A company can have as many corporate memberships as they wish, however each individual is subject to monthly fees and quarterly food minimum, as well as the one time subscription. Interested in multiple memberships for your organization? Contact us at joinus@tcclub.com to learn more about our corporate group subscription offer.
 Regardless if you hold a Corporate, Personal, or Not For Profit membership at TCC, your spouse may apply for Spousal Membership so that they, too, can experience membership at TCC for a very affordable rate. 

What Members Say...“The members of the club are people that are great to know. I like to describe them as the “movers and shakers” of Vancouver. These are individuals that are here to spend time with others while doing things they love to do. I also feel the business facilities at the club are unparalleled. I am easily able to secure facilities for business events and meetings. Based on those three reasons alone, there is no other club that comes close!”
- Neil Belenkie, Member since 2013


Personal Memberships
At Terminal City Club we want to be a part of your life each step of the way, from starting out your career, to welcoming your first child to the world, to your retirement. The Club's highest priority is ensuring members have opportunities to network, socialize and relax.
Members have exclusive access to Club-organized monthly, annual, and additional special culinary events, which include complimentary wine-tastings on the second Thursday of each month. Annual events include the Club’s Golf Tournament, spectacular holiday family brunches and off-site venue experiences such as Broadway shows.
 
 Regardless if you hold a Corporate, Personal, or Not For Profit membership at TCC, your spouse may apply for Spousal Membership so that they, too, can experience membership at TCC for a very affordable rate. No matter if your membership is for business, personal, or a combination of both, members can find a home for themselves at TCC.
What Members say... “It is the people who make this Club a place where you want to be. The familiarity and relationships you build with the staff and other members is invaluable."
– Donald McInnes, Member since 1998 


Non-Profit Memberships
Terminal City Club values community inside and outside of the Club, which is why we offer our Non-Profit members a special membership package so that they can focus on giving back to our community. Our ‘Not for Profit’ members enjoy full access to the Club and to all of its amenities, are not subject to a quarterly food minimum and, with Board approval, TCC may waive subscription for one representative of a registered Not for Profit.
 
Many of our Non-Profit members use the Club as their office-away-from-the-office, with space for undisturbed work or quiet meetings in the Members’ Lounge or Business Centre. The Club also offers flexible function space for larger meetings, socials, and gala events. Our dedicated banquet kitchen is staffed by an award-winning culinary team, and the Club’s grand ballroom can accommodate service for 500 guests.
