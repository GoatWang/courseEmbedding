Morningstar Ratings1


as of 05/31/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Global Technology Fund among 
191,
191,
182
and 
148
Technology
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 05/31/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Global Technology Fund among 
191,
191,
182
and 
148
Technology
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.

comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation

					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Investment Objective
The fund's objective is long-term capital growth.
Strategy
The fund invests at least 80% of net assets throughout the world in the common stocks of companies that are expected to generate a majority of their revenues from the development, advancement, and use of technology. The primary emphasis is on leading global technology companies. The fund will normally seek to invest a minimum of 30% of the portfolio in established and emerging foreign markets and the balance in the U.S.

Higher
Moderate
Lower






















This fund aggressively pursues long-term capital growth by investing in foreign and U.S. companies that are expected to benefit from rapid advances in technology.  Seeking to capitalize on breakthroughs in a broad range of tech-related industries, the fund has the potential to provide superior capital appreciation.The fund is less diversified than a non-focused fund and its substantial reward potential is coupled with significant risk. In addition, any foreign holdings could be affected by declining local currencies or adverse political or economic events.

					**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.

Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis.  A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. 
If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. 
When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.


Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.

When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.

All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.  Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk.  Please consult the funds' prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds' risks.

T. Rowe Price (TROW) to Post Q2 Earnings: A Beat in Store?


July 24, 2017, 06:42:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

With revenues and earnings projected to grow year over year, we expect T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.TROW to beat earnings expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 25.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?
 Our proven model shows that T. Rowe Price is likely to beat on earnings in the second quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat - a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold).
 You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +2.38%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of T. Rowe Price's Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.  
 Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated stocks) going into an earnings announcement.
 Below is the company's earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart:T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseT. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteShares of T. Rowe Price gained 8.9% during the second quarter ended Jun 30, 2017, outperforming the 7.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsMutual Fund Products Performance: According to Morningstar data, T. Rowe Price witnessed around $5.6 billion of net outflows in U.S. mutual fund products in the to-be-reported quarter.
 However, the company is likely to record a rise in assets under management (AUM) as the second quarter experienced decent performance of equity markets. Notably, the S&P 500 index gained 3.1% in the quarter, which is likely to benefit T. Rowe Price, given its equity-heavy asset mix.Insignificant Fee Waivers: Management believes that with the gradually improving interest-rate environment, fee waivers in its money market mutual funds and trusts would be insignificant.Revenue Growth: T. Rowe Price's efforts to improve its operating efficiency, has resulted in year-over-year growth in the top line over the past few years. We believe that the company is well poised to sustain the uptrend, going forward, on the back of several planned initiatives largely tied with launching investment strategies and vehicles, enhancing client engagement capabilities in each distribution channels, strengthening distribution channel in the U.S., EMEA, and the Asia Pacific, and improving its technology platform and deriving long-term cost efficiencies.Expenses to Escalate: The company did not point out anything related to its cost-control initiatives during the quarter, due to its several planned strategic initiatives. T. Rowe Price projects operating expenses for 2017 at growth rate of 10% (excluding the charge tied with the Dell appraisal rights matter). Notably, T. Rowe Price is anticipating capital expenditures in 2017 to be approximately $200 million, including two-third for technology development.
 Notably, this investment manager could not win analysts' confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at $1.26, over the last seven days.Stocks that Warrant a Look
 Here are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.
 OM Asset Management PLC OMAM is scheduled to report second-quarter results on Aug 3. It has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
 The Earnings ESP for Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC OZM is +50.00% and it carries a Zacks Rank #1. The company is slated to release second-quarter results on Aug 2.
 Franklin Resources, Inc. BEN has an Earnings ESP of +1.37% and a Zacks Rank #2. It is set to report June quarter-end results on Jul 28.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!
 It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.
 Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it. If you don't buy now, you may kick yourself in 2020. Click here for the 6 trades >>

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Note: Analysis represents the equity-only performance of the portfolio as calculated by the Wilshire Atlas attribution model, and is exclusive of cash, trusts, mutual funds, de-listed securities and other non-equity holdings. Returns will not match official TRP performance because Wilshire uses different pricing and exchange rate sources and does not capture intra-day trading or fair-value pricing. Performance for each security is obtained in the local currency and, if necessary, is converted to U.S. Dollars using an exchange rate determined by an independent third party.

Invests primarily in companies we expect to generate a majority of revenue from the development, advancement, and use of technology. Focus on the common stocks of what we consider to be leading technology companies around the world.
The fund is less diversified than stock funds investing in a broader range of industries and, therefore, could experience significant volatility. Any foreign holdings could be affected by declining local currencies or adverse political or economic events.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Benefits & Risks
We believe that companies benefiting from rapid advances in technology offer significant opportunities for long-term growth, which is often reflected in rapidly rising stock prices.The fund is less diversified than stock funds investing in a broader range of industries and, therefore, could experience significant volatility.Any foreign holdings could be affected by declining local currencies or adverse political or economic events.



Investor Profile
For the investor seeking aggressive long-term capital growth potential who can accept above-average price fluctuations.This fund should not represent an investor’s complete investment program or be used for short-term trading purposes.

Note: Analysis represents the equity-only performance of the portfolio as calculated by the Wilshire Atlas attribution model, and is exclusive of cash, trusts, mutual funds, de-listed securities and other non-equity holdings. Returns will not match official TRP performance because Wilshire uses different pricing and exchange rate sources and does not capture intra-day trading or fair-value pricing. Performance for each security is obtained in the local currency and, if necessary, is converted to U.S. Dollars using an exchange rate determined by an independent third party.

Strategy






Investment Objective
		To increase the value of its shares, over the long term, through growth in the value of its investments. The fund invests mainly in a diversified portfolio of stocks of technology development or utilization companies, with a focus on leading global technology companies. The companies may be anywhere in the world, including emerging markets.


Investment Approach
Seeks long-term growth by investing primarily in the common stocks of companies around the world expected to benefit from Seeks long-term growth by investing primarily in the common stocks of companies that generate the majority of revenues from the development, advancement, and use of technology.   Stock selection is driven by rigorous research and analysis of companies, sectors, and industry trends. The portfolio invests primarily in the common stocks of technology companies or companies enabled by technology across the entire market capitalization spectrum. We seek companies which can successfully weather economic cycles and deliver sustainable growth through product development and innovation, at a reasonable valuation.While our primary emphasis is on a company’s prospects for future growth, valuation can also be an important consideration, particularly when valuation reaches extreme levels.The portfolio is less diversified than a non-focused fund and its substantial reward potential is coupled with significant risk. In addition, any foreign holdings could be affected by declining local currencies or adverse political or economic events. 


Portfolio Construction

Typically 35-60 stock portfolio
Non-U.S. companies typically make up 25-45% of the portfolio
Portfolio consists of highest conviction ideas from a global perspective
Diversification across sectors, countries/currencies, and end markets is a risk management tool
Bottom-up stock picking is used to capitalize on rapid and extreme changes in technology trends

Source for performance: T. Rowe Price. Fund performance is calculated using the official NAV with dividends reinvested, if any. The value of an investment and any income from it can go down as well as up. Investors may get back less than the amount invested. It will be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the base currency of the fund and the subscription currency, if different. Sales charges, taxes and other locally applied costs have not been deducted and if applicable, they will reduce the performance figures. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.

Hedged share classes (denoted by 'h') utilise investment techniques to mitigate currency risk between the underlying investment currency(ies) of the fund and the currency of the hedged share class. The costs of doing so will be borne by the share class and there is no guarantee that such hedging will be effective.




   Please   note that the Fund typically has a risk of high volatility.






   Please   note that no management fees are charged to the Z, S and J share classes. No   administration agent fees are charged to the J class. No expenses or any   other fees are charged to the Z class. Fee arrangements for the Z, S and J   classes are made directly with the investment manager. Please see the   prospectus for further information.



   Where   the base currency of the fund differs from the share class currency, exchange   rate movements may affect returns.

Emerging Markets Equity

In emerging markets, identifying winners can be profitable; but avoiding losers is critical. Investing in the region since 1985, we believe there is no substitute for proprietary, fundamentally-driven research. That’s why today we have one of the industry’s deepest emerging and frontier markets equity research platforms.
 

U.S. Equity

We’ve been a leader in US equity investment since we were founded in 1937. During that time, market conditions have constantly changed, but one thing has remained reliably the same – our consistent investment approach and resolute focus on delivering long-term returns for our clients.

Invests primarily in companies we expect to generate a majority of revenue from the development, advancement, and use of technology. Focus on the common stocks of what we consider to be leading technology companies around the world.
The fund is less diversified than stock funds investing in a broader range of industries and, therefore, could experience significant volatility. Any foreign holdings could be affected by declining local currencies or adverse political or economic events.

*Ratings displayed with hollow stars represent Morningstar Extended Performance Ratings.  Morningstar provides adjusted historical returns and an Extended Performance Rating for some mutual fund share class that don't have a 1, 3-, 5-, or 10-year performance history.  These hypothetical Morningstar Ratings are based on the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted for fees and expenses.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







*The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date.  Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, The I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher. 







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Note: Analysis represents the equity-only performance of the portfolio as calculated by the Wilshire Atlas attribution model, and is exclusive of cash, trusts, mutual funds, de-listed securities and other non-equity holdings. Returns will not match official TRP performance because Wilshire uses different pricing and exchange rate sources and does not capture intra-day trading or fair-value pricing. Performance for each security is obtained in the local currency and, if necessary, is converted to U.S. Dollars using an exchange rate determined by an independent third party.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 188 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term capital growth.




Strategy



The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets (including any borrowings for investment purposes) in the common stocks of companies the managers expect to generate a majority of their revenues from the development, advancement, and use of technology. It normally seeks to invest in at least 5 countries and allocate approximately 25% of its assets in stocks of companies outside the U.S, including companies in emerging markets.


Risk



The technology industries can be significantly affected by obsolescence of existing technology, short product cycles, falling prices and profits, competition from new market entrants, and general economic conditions. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.

A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The technology industries can be significantly affected by obsolescence of existing technology, short product cycles, falling prices and profits, competition from new market entrants, and general economic conditions. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

� 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
