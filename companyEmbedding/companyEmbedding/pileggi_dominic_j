 CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Lubrizol Corporation (NYSE: LZ)

was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Board.










 Dominic J. Pileggi - The New Appointment
to Board of Directors of The Lubrizol Corporation



Mr. Pileggi is President and Chief Executive Officer

Mr. Pileggi began his career at Thomas & Betts in
1979 as a sales representative and progressed steadily through a variety
of management positions until being named president of the company's largest
business, Electrical Products, in 1994. Mr. Pileggi briefly left Thomas
& Betts from 1995 to 2000, during which time he held senior executive
positions at Casco Plastic, Inc., Jordan Telecommunications and Viasystems

and operational leadership of the company in 2003. In January 2004, he
was named Chief Executive Officer and elected to serve on the company's
Board of Directors. Mr. Pileggi holds an economics degree from Rutgers
University.
James L. Hambrick, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Lubrizol, commented, "Dominic Pileggi brings a breadth
of experience in sales, marketing and international management to the
Lubrizol board. In addition, his perspective as an active CEO driving
growth in an established industrial company will be particularly relevant
at this stage in Lubrizol's transformation. The Board and I are looking
forward to working with Dominic as we continue the transformation of Lubrizol
to a higher growth, premier specialty chemical company." 
The Lubrizol Corporation (NYSE: LZ) is an innovative
specialty chemical company that produces and supplies technologies that

Thomas & Betts Names Dominic J. Pileggi President and COOPublished: December 2002MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec. 3 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Board of Directors of Thomas & Betts Corporation announced that it has elected Dominic J. Pileggi to the newly created position of president and chief operating officer for the company, effective January 1, 2003. Pileggi currently serves as president of the company's electrical division. He will continue in this role until a successor is named and will continue to report to T. Kevin Dunnigan, the company's chairman and chief executive officer. 
 In his new position, Pileggi will have responsibility for the company's global business operations including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Thomas & Betts has four key business segments: Electrical, Communications, HVAC and Steel Structures. In 2001, the company reported revenues of $1.4 billion. 
 "Over the past two years, Dominic has been instrumental in directing the turnaround at Thomas & Betts and this promotion recognizes these accomplishments," said T. Kevin Dunnigan, chairman and chief executive officer. "His leadership and extensive knowledge of the company and industry will be important factors in moving Thomas & Betts to the next level of operational, competitive and financial performance." Dunnigan, who rejoined Thomas & Betts in August 2000 at the request of the company's Board of Directors, said that he would continue as chairman and chief executive officer. 
 "I remain committed to seeing Thomas & Betts successfully through the turnaround and ensuring that it is competitively positioned to grow as a leader in global electrical products markets," Dunnigan commented. 
 Pileggi, 51, began his career at Thomas & Betts as a sales representative in 1979. Over the next 15 years, he held positions of increasing responsibility in sales, marketing and general management. In 1988, he was named president of the company's Electronics OEM business, where he earned a reputation as a decisive leader able to quickly and effectively respond to a rapidly changing competitive environment. In 1992, he was promoted to president of the company's largest business, electrical products, a position he held until 1995 when he left Thomas & Betts to serve as president and chief executive officer of a privately held company. Pileggi rejoined Thomas & Betts in October 2000 and has played an integral role in comprehensively restructuring the company's business processes and practices in its $1.1 billion electrical products business. 
 "Thomas & Betts has a powerful portfolio of industry leading brands, excellent distribution partners and revitalized factories," said Pileggi. "Our task now is to ensure that the company's operations support the performance of these core assets in all of our markets." EC
