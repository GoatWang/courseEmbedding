Read moreAMG Funds – Why Work For Us?Why Work For Us?About UsProductsClients About Us Products ClientsEstablished in 2005, AMG Funds provides access to many of AMG’s Affiliates through our family of mutual funds, separately managed accounts and asset allocation products. In addition, AMG Funds oversees and distributes a number of complementary, open-architecture mutual funds managed by non-AMG Affiliates. This broad combination of investment products allows us to serve the needs of the financial advisor community and their clients.AMG seeks to achieve earnings growth by investing in high quality boutique asset management firms that have demonstrated a consistent ability to deliver excellent returns over the long term and potential for significant future growth. Our unique partnership approach creates powerful incentives for continued strong performance by providing Affiliate management with direct equity participation in their firms alongside AMG. In our investments in each of our Affiliates, we hold a substantial equity interest while the remaining equity interests are retained by the management of the Affiliate. This strategy provides a degree of liquidity and diversification to principal owners of boutique firms, and also addresses the succession and ownership transition issues facing many founders and principal owners. AMG’s structure ensures that Affiliates maintain operational autonomy in managing their businesses – an approach that also preserves each Affiliate’s entrepreneurial culture and distinct investment process. With meaningful equity stakes in their firms, AMG’s Affiliate partners operate strong and profitable investment firms with the objective of managing their businesses to produce long-term growth.Although we invest in firms that we expect to be successful in their own right, we are committed to helping Affiliates identify opportunities for further growth and leverage the benefits of economies of scale. These cross-Affiliate initiatives include broadening distribution in the U.S. and globally, developing new products and providing strategic support and enhanced operational capabilities.Since our founding, AMG has created shareholder value by successfully making equity investments in industry-leading boutique firms and leveraging our scale to support and enhance their growth.Read moreAMG’s Affiliates are among the leading investors in their disciplines with outstanding reputations, superior client service, and excellent track records of outperformance relative to their peers and benchmarks across a wide range of investment styles, asset classes and geographic areas.  As a group, AMG’s Affiliates manage approximately 400 investment products across each major product category: global, international and emerging markets equities, domestic equities, alternative and fixed income products.  We predominantly offer active portfolio management of international and domestic equities from some of the industry’s most respected investment firms, including AQR Capital Management, BlueMountain Capital Management, First Quadrant, Genesis Asset Managers, Harding Loevner, Third Avenue Management and Tweedy, Browne Company.Our diverse array of products enables AMG to participate broadly in the most attractive segments of the investment management industry, while generating incremental growth by introducing Affiliate products into additional distribution channels.Read moreInstitutional Investors AMG offers a diverse array of high-quality products to institutional investors worldwide, serving clients in nearly 40 countries. Through our Affiliates, we manage assets for foundations and endowments, defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations and municipalities, and Taft-Hartley plans, with disciplined and focused investment styles that address the specialized needs of institutional clients. The depth and breadth of our products reflects the diversity of AMG’s Affiliate group and the strength of our multi-boutique model. As institutional investors increasingly seek actively-managed products, our distribution platforms help meet the global demand for boutique asset managers. Through our offices located around the world, we provide investors in Asia, Australia, Europe and the Middle East with access to tailored Affiliate products. With a region-specific focus, our experienced professionals have a strong reputation for providing superior sales, market and client service.Retail Investors Through AMG Funds, we provide individual investors with access to our family of mutual funds, separately managed accounts and asset-allocation products. While each firm operates independently and follows a distinct and proven investment process, AMG’s multi-Affiliate structure allows individual investors to access products that cover nearly every asset class and investment strategy.With a team of experienced sales professionals, AMG Funds services and distributes single- and multi-manager Affiliate mutual fund and separate account products to intermediaries, including banks, brokerage firms and other sponsored platforms.Read moreAMG Funds ReviewsAMG Funds114.5StarStarStarStarStarRating TrendsRating TrendsRecommend to a friendApprove of CEOCEO0 Ratings Feb 15, 2016 Helpful (3)"Client Facing"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at AMG Funds full-time (More than a year)ProsGreat culture and lots of upside for anyone joining today.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
