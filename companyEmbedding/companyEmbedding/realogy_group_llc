    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Realogy Holdings Corporation (pronounced "rēl′ ə jē", as in "real" estate) is an American publicly owned company that provides real estate and relocation services. It owns and franchises several real estate brands and brokerages. It also provides relocation, title and settlement services.
History[edit]
Realogy was created as a result of an October 24, 2005 announcement by Cendant that it had decided to split into four separate companies, citing a necessity to diversify in appealing to stockholders and in an attempt to increase the value of the post-split up company. These four categories include "Real Estate, Travel Distribution, Hospitality and Vehicle Rental Companies."[2]
On July 31, 2006, the separation was completed, and Realogy became a self-operating company.[2] Subsequently, the Cendant name has been completely retired.
On December 18, 2006, Realogy announced it had accepted a $8.5 billion buyout offer from private equity group Apollo Management. The transaction closed on April 10, 2007.[3]
On October 10, 2012, Realogy became a publicly owned company. In its initial public offering (IPO), the company sold 40 million shares at $27 each, raising $1.08 billion (US).[4]
Realogy's business units include Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, CENTURY 21, Coldwell Banker, Coldwell Banker Commercial, The Corcoran Group, ERA, Sotheby's International Realty, ZipRealty, NRT LLC, Cartus, Title Resource Group and ZapLabs, its innovation and technology development subsidiary. Collectively, Realogy's franchise system members operate approximately 14,100 offices with 272,300 sales associates doing business in 112 countries and territories around the world. In 2016, Realogy earned $5.81 billion in revenue.[5]
Realogy is led by Chairman, CEO & President Richard A. Smith. Smith was appointed to the Bipartisan Policy Center's newly formed Housing Commission in December 2011.[6] Smith also was named among SmartMoney magazine's "Power 30: The World’s Most Influential Players," in October 2011.[7] In January 2016, he was named the Most Powerful Person in Residential Real Estate Brokerage for the third consecutive year, according to the Swanepoel Power 200 rankings.[8]
Realogy's former headquarters was located in Parsippany, New Jersey, before April 2013, when the company moved its corporate headquarters to a new facility at 175 Park Avenue in Madison, New Jersey.[9]
On July 15, 2014, Realogy acquired California based ZipRealty (as of June 2016, rebranded as ZapLabs [10]) for approximately $166 million, in order to improve the technology related aspects of real estate. [11]
In March 2016, Realogy was recognized as a 2016 World’s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute, an independent center of research promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance, the fifth consecutive year in which it has received this honor.[12]

Realogy Holdings Corporation (pronounced "rēl′ ə jē", as in "real" estate) is an American publicly owned company that provides real estate and relocation services. It owns and franchises several real estate brands and brokerages. It also provides relocation, title and settlement services.
History[edit]
Realogy was created as a result of an October 24, 2005 announcement by Cendant that it had decided to split into four separate companies, citing a necessity to diversify in appealing to stockholders and in an attempt to increase the value of the post-split up company. These four categories include "Real Estate, Travel Distribution, Hospitality and Vehicle Rental Companies."[2]
On July 31, 2006, the separation was completed, and Realogy became a self-operating company.[2] Subsequently, the Cendant name has been completely retired.
On December 18, 2006, Realogy announced it had accepted a $8.5 billion buyout offer from private equity group Apollo Management. The transaction closed on April 10, 2007.[3]
On October 10, 2012, Realogy became a publicly owned company. In its initial public offering (IPO), the company sold 40 million shares at $27 each, raising $1.08 billion (US).[4]
Realogy's business units include Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, CENTURY 21, Coldwell Banker, Coldwell Banker Commercial, The Corcoran Group, ERA, Sotheby's International Realty, ZipRealty, NRT LLC, Cartus, Title Resource Group and ZapLabs, its innovation and technology development subsidiary. Collectively, Realogy's franchise system members operate approximately 14,100 offices with 272,300 sales associates doing business in 112 countries and territories around the world. In 2016, Realogy earned $5.81 billion in revenue.[5]
Realogy is led by Chairman, CEO & President Richard A. Smith. Smith was appointed to the Bipartisan Policy Center's newly formed Housing Commission in December 2011.[6] Smith also was named among SmartMoney magazine's "Power 30: The World’s Most Influential Players," in October 2011.[7] In January 2016, he was named the Most Powerful Person in Residential Real Estate Brokerage for the third consecutive year, according to the Swanepoel Power 200 rankings.[8]
Realogy's former headquarters was located in Parsippany, New Jersey, before April 2013, when the company moved its corporate headquarters to a new facility at 175 Park Avenue in Madison, New Jersey.[9]
On July 15, 2014, Realogy acquired California based ZipRealty (as of June 2016, rebranded as ZapLabs [10]) for approximately $166 million, in order to improve the technology related aspects of real estate. [11]
In March 2016, Realogy was recognized as a 2016 World’s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute, an independent center of research promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance, the fifth consecutive year in which it has received this honor.[12]

Realogy Group LLC Key Developments

Realogy Group LLC Announces Borrowing of New Tranche of Term Loans and Refinancing of Existing Term Loan B
Jul 22 16
On July 20, 2016, Realogy Group LLC, (“Realogy Group”) refinanced certain indebtedness by (1) borrowing a new tranche of term loans under its term loan A senior secured credit facility of $355 million with a five-year maturity and (2) refinancing its existing term loan B of $1.863 billion due March 2020 under its senior secured credit facility with a new term loan B of $1.1 billion due July 2022. Simultaneously, the net proceeds from the new tranche of term loans under the term loan A senior secured credit facility and the new term loan B together with revolver borrowings of $225 million under the senior secured credit facility and cash on hand were used to repay the existing $1.863 billion term loan B. On July 20, 2016, Realogy Group entered into a first amendment to the term loan A senior secured credit agreement, dated as of October 23, 2015, with Intermediate Holdings, the lenders party thereto from time to time and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders. The first amendment provides for a new tranche of term loan A borrowings, named “Term A-1 Loans,” in the amount of $355 million that mature on July 20, 2021. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Bank plc, Citizens Bank, N.A., Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. acted as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners for the New Term A-1 Loans. Consistent with the pricing on the existing term A loans, the interest rates with respect to the New Term A-1 Loans under the term loan A agreement are based on, at its option, adjusted LIBOR plus 2.25% or ABR plus 1.25%, in each case subject to adjustment based on the company’s senior secured leverage ratio. The first amendment expands the pricing grid for the New Term A-1 Loans to include a new pricing adjustment where the senior secured leverage ratio is less than 2.00% as follows: The New Term Loan A-1 Loans provide for quarterly amortization payments on the last day of each quarter, totaling per annum 2.5%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5% and 10.0% of the original principal amount of the New Term Loan A-1 Loans, commencing September 30, 2016, with the balance of the New Term A-1 Loans due in full on July 20, 2021. All other material provisions under the term loan A agreement remain substantially unchanged. On July 20, 2016, Realogy Group entered into a third amendment to the amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of March 5, 2013, as amended, among Intermediate Holdings, Realogy Group, the several lenders from time to time parties thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents parties thereto. The third amendment replaced the existing $1.863 billion term loan issued under the credit agreement through a refinancing of the existing term loan with a new $1.1 billion term loan B due July 20, 2022. Net proceeds from the New Term A-1 Loans, the New Term Loan B, revolver borrowings of $225 million under the credit agreement and cash on hand were used to repay the existing term loan B. The interest rate and amortization with respect to the new term loan B remains unchanged from the existing term loan B and all other material provisions under the credit agreement remain substantially unchanged. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., BMO Capital Markets Corp., Barclays Bank plc, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. acted as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners for the New term loan B.


Realogy Group LLC Proposes $500 Million Offering of Senior Notes
May 26 16
Realogy Holdings Corp. announced that its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Realogy Group LLC, together with a co-issuer, is proposing to issue $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2023 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes will be guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by each of Realogy Group's domestic subsidiaries (other than the co-issuer of the Notes) that is a guarantor under its senior secured credit facilities and its outstanding securities. The notes will also be guaranteed by the company on an unsecured senior subordinated basis. The notes will be effectively subordinated to all of Realogy Group's existing and future senior secured debt, including its senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to reduce outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include additional debt transactions.


Realogy Proposes to Issue $250 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 5.250% Senior Notes Due 2021
Feb 25 16
Realogy Group LLC proposed to issue $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due 2021 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The Notes will be issued under the same indenture as the $300 million aggregate principal amount of Realogy Group's 5.250% senior notes due 2021. The Notes will have identical terms, other than the issue date, the issue price and the first interest payment date, and will constitute part of the same series as the Existing 5.250% Senior Notes. The Notes will have the same CUSIP numbers as the Existing 5.250% Senior Notes, except for the Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S which will, on the 40th day following the issue date of the Notes, have the same CUSIP numbers. The Notes that have the same CUSIP numbers as the Existing 5.250% Senior Notes are expected to be fungible with the Existing 5.250% Senior Notes. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to temporarily reduce outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and for working capital purposes, prior to using such net proceeds to retire a portion of its outstanding 3.375% Senior Notes at maturity in May 2016.
