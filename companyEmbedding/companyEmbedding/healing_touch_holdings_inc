We will receive all proceeds from the sale of the common stock and intend to use
the proceeds from this Offering, to continue implementing the business and
marketing plan. The expenses of this Offering, including the preparation of this
prospectus and the filing of this registration statement, estimated at $76,616
are being paid for by us. Our budgetary allocations may vary, however, depending
upon the percentage of proceeds that we obtain from the Offering. For example,
we may determine that it is more beneficial to allocate funds toward securing
potential financing and business opportunities in the short terms rather than to
conserve funds to satisfy continuous disclosure requirements for a longer
period.


We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business. Currently, we
consider our primary competitor to be G Spa. G Spa can use its resources in a
variety of competitive ways, including by making acquisitions, investing more
aggressively in development and competing more aggressively for marketing and
advertisers. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not attempt to copy
our business model, or portions thereof, and that this will not erode our market
share and brand recognition and impair our growth rate and profitability. If our
competitors are able to provide similar or better facilities, services and
products than ours, we could experience a significant decline in clientele. Any
such decline could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. Also in
response to any such competitors, we may be required to decrease our fees for
services, which may reduce our operating revenues and profitability.


Company Description
Healing Touch Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on May 17, 2016, as
It’s Divine, Inc. On October 5, 2016, we amended our certificate of
incorporation to change our name to Healing Touch Holdings, Inc.

We own and operate seven (7) spas in Singapore which have operated under the
brand name


 “Healing Touch” since the “Healing Touch” trade name was established
in 2001 before we acquired such subsidiaries in June 2016. Currently, our seven
(7) Healing Touch spas have 83 treatment rooms and approximately 107 therapists
and are visited by more than 20,000 clients annually. We have also just
commenced a program to franchise our spas under the “Healing Touch” brand name
in Singapore and other countries in the Southeast Asian region. Our spas, and
our franchised locations, provide services that include massage, facial and
slimming treatments as well as selling related beauty products. Each of the
Company's spas generally offer similar treatments and beauty products.

Healing Touch spas are the most recommended Singapore spas on Facebook and are
rated Number 2 as to Singapore spas by TripAdvisor users. Healing Touch is also
rated the top spa brand in a 2016 brand survey conducted in Singapore by Brand
Alliance (Influential Brands). Healing Touch offers award winning body massage,
facial and slimming treatments and is committed to impressing our customers with
their treatment experience and results. Our promise to customers: Caring hands,
divine treats.

Our vision is to be the largest spa chain brand in Southeast Asia and to help
people live more healthy and beautiful lives.
---

The Company's long-term mission is to help people live more healthy and
beautiful lives. 

To successfully achieve our mission and build a winning organization, we must be
the place where therapists can have successful and satisfying careers, which
will drive great guest experiences and in turn, guests for life.

We have set our focus on serving wealthy individuals with premium consumption 
powers (mid- to upper-tier consumer group). We have also set our consumer focus 
on corporate clients who are willing to compensate their employees with 
memberships in our facilities as extra benefits. However, currently we are not 
reliant on corporate clients.   
---

Our principal executive offices are located at 140 Paya Lebar Road, AZ Building
#09-26, Singapore 409015, and our telephone number is +65-68505050. Our
corporate website address is www.healingtouchspa.com.

We will receive all proceeds from the sale of the common stock and intend to use
the proceeds from this Offering, to continue implementing the business and
marketing plan. The expenses of this Offering, including the preparation of this
prospectus and the filing of this registration statement, estimated at $76,616
are being paid for by us. Our budgetary allocations may vary, however, depending
upon the percentage of proceeds that we obtain from the Offering. For example,
we may determine that it is more beneficial to allocate funds toward securing
potential financing and business opportunities in the short terms rather than to
conserve funds to satisfy continuous disclosure requirements for a longer
period.


We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business. Currently, we
consider our primary competitor to be G Spa. G Spa can use its resources in a
variety of competitive ways, including by making acquisitions, investing more
aggressively in development and competing more aggressively for marketing and
advertisers. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not attempt to copy
our business model, or portions thereof, and that this will not erode our market
share and brand recognition and impair our growth rate and profitability. If our
competitors are able to provide similar or better facilities, services and
products than ours, we could experience a significant decline in clientele. Any
such decline could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. Also in
response to any such competitors, we may be required to decrease our fees for
services, which may reduce our operating revenues and profitability.

Healing Touch History
The Healing Touch program has been taught since 1989 to more than 100,000 participants worldwide and in over 32 countries. The program (originally known as Colorado Center for Healing Touch) was developed by Janet Mentgen, BSN, RN, HNC, HTCP/I, as a medically-based energy therapy training program for nurses. (Click here for Janet's story) Over the last 18 years Healing Touch has been effective in demonstrating a positive impact in the health care community. Healing Touch is widely respected and increasingly accepted, not only in the United States, but in many countries around the globe. It is considered one of the leading energy medicine programs in the world.
Healing Touch Program Core Values
 We use these guiding principles to help us in making decisions and direction for HTP.
• Positive Team and Family Spirit - Our success is dependent upon the collective energy and intelligence of all of our Team Members. We strive to create a work environment where motivated Team Members can flourish and succeed to their highest potential. We appreciate effort and reward results.
• Respect - We honor the rights and beliefs of our fellow associates, our customers, our vendors, and our community. We treat others with the highest degree of dignity, equality, and trust and respect each person’s individuality, beliefs, and inherent worth.
• Accountability - We accept our individual and team responsibilities and we meet our commitments. We take responsibility for our performance in all of our decisions and actions.
• Integrity – We are ethical and honest and inspire trust by saying what we mean, matching our behaviors to our words and taking responsibility for our actions.
• Embrace and Drive Change - We do not fear change, but embrace it enthusiastically, and perhaps even more importantly, encourage and drive it. We plan and prepared for constant change.
• Self Development- We constantly challenge and stretch ourselves in the areas of personal growth and well-being. We encourage each other’s in their self development as well.
• Build Open and Honest Relationships - Strong, positive relationships built on open honest communication are important to HTP. Strong relationships allow us to accomplish much more than we would be able to otherwise.
• Be Passionate and Determined - We value passion, determination, perseverance, and the sense of divine timing. We are inspired because we believe in what we are doing and where we are going.
• Be Humble – Humility opens one up energetically, to listen, to apologize, to understand another or to accept our humanity. We choose open-mindedness and curiosity over protecting our point of view. We continually recognize the contributions of others.
• Satisfying and Delighting our Customers- We go to extraordinary lengths to satisfy and delight our customers. We want to meet or exceed their expectations on every interaction with HTP. We know that by doing so we turn customers into advocates for our business. Advocates do more than work with us, they talk about HTP to their friends and others. We want to serve our customers competently, efficiently, knowledgeably and enthusiasm.
• Creating Prosperity – Through the offering of our products and services we are a valuable part of our world. We recognize that creating prosperity for ourselves and others within our community is essential to generate growth, opportunity, job satisfaction, job security and exceptional service.
