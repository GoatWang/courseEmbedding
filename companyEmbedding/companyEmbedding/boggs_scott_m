EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
    TECHNOLOGY IS
          dramatically changing the role of the financial
          professional from that of information recorder to business
          strategist—making the financial manager much more critical to
          the success of an enterprise.  
TO KEEP PACE WITH these changes, the financial
            professional is expected to provide accurate and timely
            financial information that can be accessed and analyzed
            quickly and easily. While digital technology may make it
            easier to collect information and move it from one place to
            another, it also has led to an incredible proliferation of
            data. Filtering, sorting, compiling, analyzing and
            disseminating financial data in ways that add real value to
            a corporation has become a daunting challenge.  
MICROSOFT CORP.— with 54 financial groups charged
            with providing financial support to more than 85 global
            subsidiary operations—has struggled with these challenges.
            Its answer is the financial “digital nervous system,” an
            intranet-based environment that links all of the company’s
            financial groups into a single, coherent system and provides
            its employees with real-time access to information and
            financial reports through the Internet. 
FIVE YEARS AGO , it took Microsoft two weeks to
          close the books. Now it takes four days. The company used to
          print and distribute 350,000 hard-copy management reports each
          year. Today, none. Through FinWeb, a network of intranet
          sites, its employees can submit travel-expense reports and be
          reimbursed, purchase goods and services and transfer capital
          assets—all from their desktops. They’ve reduced paperwork,
          transaction time and publishing and distribution costs.  
IT’S POSSIBLE for any of its employees who need
            financial information for decision making to access detailed
            reports that are updated daily. The financial system lets
            people drill down through layers of information to get
            answers—quickly, easily and without computer programming
            skills. None of the technology used to achieve the
            objectives is beyond the reach of any organization—large or
            small.  
AS A RESULT, the company is able to achieve something
            finance organizations strive for: the ability to add more
            value at the strategic end of the business and spend less
            time processing transactions.   SCOTT M. BOGGS, CPA, is Microsoft’s corporate
          controller. Prior to joining Microsoft, he spent eight years
          with Deloitte, Haskins & Sells as a manager in the
          emerging business services group. 

T 
echnology is providing the tools that are revolutionizing the role
    of financial professionals from that of information recorders and
    processors to business strategists—making them much more critical to
    the success of an enterprise. 

 
The changes started about a decade ago, when the personal computer
  began to supplant the mainframe computer. The desktop machine was
  suddenly available at the right price and with enough computational
  power to make it an essential business tool—streamlining manual
  processes, managing data and exchanging knowledge. And when the PC was
  linked to an enterprise network, the evolution became a revolution,
  totally transforming the business environment and the role of the
  financial professional. Add the incredible growth of the Internet and
  we have the communication medium for a true global economy in which
  data can be transmitted around the world almost instantly. Suddenly a
  company's value is determined not only by its tangible assets but also
  by its ability to collect and use information. 
Business continues to face other transformations triggered by
  widespread computerization. The number of distribution channels is
  growing, forcing most companies to increase their mix of products and
  services—and making the task of keeping track of revenues, expenses
  and other financial information far more complicated. At the same
  time, many companies are finding that to stay competitive they must
  update their fundamental business model to adapt to the ever-changing
  marketplace. 


THE CHALLENGE 
The financial professional is expected to keep pace with these
  changes and provide accurate and timely financial information that can
  be accessed and analyzed quickly and easily. While digital technology
  may make it easier to collect information and move it from one place
  to another, it also has led to an incredible proliferation of data.
  Filtering, sorting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating financial
  data in ways that add real value to a corporation have become daunting
  tasks. 
At Microsoft, where 54 financial groups are charged with providing
  financial support to more than 85 global subsidiary operations, we
  have struggled with these challenges. Our answer is something we call
  the financial "digital nervous system," an intranet-based
  environment that links all of the company's financial groups into a
  single, coherent system and provides our employees with real-time
  access to information and financial reports through the Internet. 


Exhibit 1: Data at the Desktop 

Microsoft’s FinWeb, an intranet system that allows employees to get
    detailed financial data about the company, provides data at the
    desktop. It also lets them submit travel-expense reports and
    purchase goods and services. Result: reduced paperwork, transaction
    time and publishing and distribution costs. 


 

This system—called FinWeb, short for Financial Information
  Network—was launched in 1995 and is part of a companywide effort to
  build a larger digital nervous system at Microsoft (see exhibit 1).
  Through FinWeb's network of intranet sites, our employees can submit
  travel-expense reports and be reimbursed, purchase goods and services
  and even transfer capital assets—all from their desktops. We've
  reduced paperwork, transaction time and publishing and distribution
  costs. 
Most important, we've made it possible for any employee who needs
  financial information for decision making to access detailed reports
  that are updated daily. Our financial system lets people drill down
  through layers of information to get answers quickly—without computer
  programming skills. 
As a result, we've been able to achieve something finance
  organizations strive for: the ability to add more value at the
  strategic end of the business and spend less time processing
  transactions. 

    
STEPS TO DEVELOPING A DIGITAL INFORMATION SYSTEM
      A simple
        financial digital nervous system begins with a basic computing
        environment that includes a network and intranet infrastructure.
        Users must have common desktop applications. Once these pieces
        are in place, the system can be developed following these steps:
          n Create a data warehouse by extracting and summarizing
          transaction data from the general ledger system to an
          ODBC-compliant database. Most common general ledger
          applications provide a variety of ways to export data into
          other applications. Depending on the nature of the extraction,
          data can be summarized as extracted or processed within the
          data warehouse.  n Implement pivot table functionality
          to create standard management reports. Data fields can be
          organized into rows, columns and page fields, and reports can
          be formatted to match existing reports. Users with some
          advanced programming knowledge can use additional tools within
          their spreadsheets to create custom queries against the data
          warehouse.  n Create a Web page that shows an index of
          available standard reports. Icons can be created to open
          spreadsheet files from the network. Additional Web pages can
          be created to describe major accounting policies, procedures,
          assumptions and other relevant information.  n Automate
          routine transaction processes by creating forms to perform
          tasks such as the creation of master data and updates, journal
          entries and invoice processing. Most general ledger
          applications provide a way to import data from external
          sources. Once created, these forms can be saved in HTML format
          as Web pages and users can access them through the intranet.
          Users with some advanced knowledge of databases can program
          additional front-end validation.  n Eliminate reports
          and manual processes that duplicate information available on
          the financial digital nervous system. 


WAREHOUSING DATA 
The system we have in place now is a far cry from the one that
  existed when I joined Microsoft as a finance manager in 1993. We had
  no intranet, no central, direct access point for electronic
  distribution of financial information. More than 30 separate general
  ledgers were scattered around the world and were consolidated on a
  Digital Equipment VAX mainframe. During the month-end close, I'd get a
  huge stack of reports every day and spend the week typing numbers into
  spreadsheets. We spent an enormous amount of time and money copying
  and collating reports and then shipping them around the world by mail,
  courier and fax. 
The key to solving this problem was to create a data warehouse using
  an extract of the general ledger in a Microsoft Access database. It
  was relatively easy to link that data to Microsoft Excel to create
  standard management reports. As the underlying data are updated, the
  standard reports are automatically refreshed to reflect the most
  current information. These electronic files are stored on network file
  servers, where they can be accessed by anyone with the right password. 
It took us about four months to build the system. When it was ready,
  I e-mailed everyone where to find the electronic reports and informed
  them that the days of printed management reports were over. Within
  five minutes of sending the e-mail a senior executive stormed into my
  office, saying the information was totally worthless. The problem
  stemmed from the cryptic eight-character spreadsheet names: You might
  open a file named eu_ww.xls, expecting to read a customer unit profit
  and loss spreadsheet but get a European unit spreadsheet instead.
  There was no way to know until you looked. 
Around that time we were just starting to learn about the Internet,
  and we realized that we could create an Excel sheet that essentially
  looked like a Web page, with a list of profit and loss sheets
  designated by simple, clear names and pictures. Beneath each name was
  a macro that pointed to a particular spreadsheet on the network. When
  we sent that Excel sheet out, we were basically launching the first
  intercompany intranet application at Microsoft. 
While that was a big step forward, we still had a long way to go.
  For example, we still had more than 30 separate legacy databases
  (those original general ledgers) and a system riddled with multiple
  charts of accounts and other inconsistent data taxonomies (rules for
  classifying and naming information). Although we had simplified the
  distribution process, it was still impossible to access the origin of
  the information. So in 1995 we made the commitment to purchase SAP R/3
  accounting software as our core system. It took about seven months to
  implement the financial modules. This system allowed us to have a
  single chart of accounts and consistent views of information across
  the organization. It also has significantly decreased our support
  costs by eliminating multiple accounting systems. 
From there we developed a number of Web-based applications that
  automated routine tasks—such as administrative procurements,
  employee-expense reimbursements, asset transfers and journal-entry
  postings—and then fed all the transactions directly into the SAP R/3
  system. Automating these processes has allowed us to reduce the cost
  of some transactions by as much as 90%. 
The system is set up so that virtually every transaction flows
  automatically from a Web site on the Microsoft intranet into the SAP
  system and is extracted on a daily basis into several SQL Server-based
  data warehouses, which then produce standard reports. As a result,
  authorized users can access on their desktop computers standardized
  consolidated revenue reports summarizing sales for broad product and
  geographic categories and then drill down through the databases
  virtually to the level of part numbers. More important, it allows
  users to customize reports and to answer questions on almost any
  financial issue. 

    
Glossary   
ODBC is the acronym for open database
        connectivity. It's a database programming interface from
        Microsoft that provides a common language for Windows
        applications to access databases on a network.  

HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It's
          the standard document format used on the World Wide Web. A
          subset of SGML (standard generalized markup language), HTML
          defines the page layout, which includes fonts and graphic
          elements as well as hypertext links to other documents on the
          Web. Each hypertext link contains the URL, or address, of a
          Web page that can reside on the very same server or on any
          server worldwide, hence the "Worldwide" Web.  

SQL stands for structured query language (SQL
          is pronounced sequel ), a language used to
          interrogate and process data in a relational database.
          Originally developed by IBM for its mainframe computers, all
          database systems designed for client/ server environments
          support SQL. SQL commands can be used to interactively work
          with a database or can be embedded within a programming
          language to interface with a database. Programming extensions
          to SQL have turned it into a full-blown database programming
          language.  

OLAP is the acronym for online analytical
          processing. OLAP software allows users to quickly analyze
          information that has been summarized into multidimensional
          views and hierarchies. For example, OLAP tools are used to
          perform trend analysis on sales and financial information and
          to drill down into masses of sales statistics in order to
          isolate the products that are the most volatile. 


DRILLING FOR ANSWERS 
Here's how I use FinWeb: Each week, I receive an e-mail message that
  contains a link to a standard Excel-format report showing actual and
  budgeted revenue figures by geographic area and product for the month,
  quarter and year. One report is dated December 25 and covers the first
  three weeks of the month (see exhibit 2). Because it's nearing the end
  of the month and it's time to start thinking about the close, it's an
  appropriate time to survey our financial condition. 
With such up-to-date information, I'm able to spot trends—often with
  enough time to act on them. I notice we're slightly behind budget for
  the month, but I'm not worried because we have one week left in the
  month. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM or PC manufacturer)
  numbers also are behind budget, but I know that a lot of our OEM
  revenue is billed during the last week of the month, so I'm not
  worried about that either. And Europe (which is designated as EMEA) is
  doing great—already ahead of budget. 
Further down, I can look at revenue by products. I notice we are
  over plan for Microsoft Office. Scanning further down I see that the
  Windows NT operating system is slightly behind plan, and the Windows
  98 operating system is lagging. The fact that games are already well
  ahead of projection indicates that this is turning into a good
  Christmas season. (While I have called up this spreadsheet using the
  link embedded in an e-mail message, I also could have navigated easily
  to exactly the same spreadsheet from the FinWeb home page.) 


DIGGING DEEPER 
Next I begin to drill down to see the source of the numbers. The
  system uses Excel's PivotTable dynamic views, so I can reconfigure the
  spreadsheet to show details I'm interested in. (For more on
  PivotTables, see "Add Perspective to Spreadsheets," JofA,
  Dec.98, page 91.) PivotTable views are an important part of FinWeb,
  providing an easy-to-use link between the spreadsheet on my desktop
  and all of the information in the data warehouses. A PivotTable lets
  me customize a spreadsheet by moving rows and columns and defining the
  data in those fields. For FinWeb, we've created formatted PivotTable
  views with preselected fields that users can choose from. 
Using the PivotTable feature, I select Europe, in U.S. dollars, and
  "All" for most of the other fields (see exhibit 3). I see
  that the Office Standard edition is ahead of plan, while the Office
  Professional version is exceeding budget by a little less. With a week
  to go, Microsoft Office sales in Europe are significantly ahead of
  projection. 
I continue to reconfigure the data to find out why Europe is doing
  so well. For example, a new PivotTable, which includes revenue totals
  by country, shows that revenue in Denmark is almost double our plan
  (see exhibit 4). If I slice and dice the data in yet another way, I
  see that much of that comes from sales of Office. 
For still more in-depth analysis, we use an internally developed
  application called MS Reports. This tool allows me to create custom
  queries against the underlying data in the warehouse by dragging and
  dropping fields into a standardized template within Excel. The MS
  Reports interface shows in plain English the available fields (see
  exhibit 5). Once the template is populated by the fields I'm
  interested in, MS Reports automatically resolves it into SQL query
  language, executes the query against the data and formats the results
  into a standard Excel report. 
So if I want to understand why Office is doing so well in Denmark, I
  can turn to MS Reports and figure which customer segments are
  responsible. After setting up a query that looks at Office sales by
  licensing program, I see that the major contributor was the licensing
  of Office to corporate customers (see exhibit 6). 
It took just a couple of minutes to set up the query and less than a
  minute to get the results. With these tools, I am not only able to
  access up-to-date revenue figures quickly and easily, but I also can
  set up a sophisticated analysis to help me explore the data and
  understand the numbers. And I can do this without having to understand
  the programming language used to query the SQL database. 
One reason all this runs so seamlessly is because we have worked to
  make sure that all data that go into the system are created equally.
  We want to make sure, for example, that when we compare Denmark's
  revenue figures for Office with the figures from Japan, the numbers
  mean the same thing. The same must be true for travel and
  entertainment expenses and every other transaction recorded in the SAP
  database. Every number one business unit enters must be comparable to
  corresponding numbers every other business unit enters. 
The key to achieving this kind of companywide uniformity is a site
  called MAP, short for Microsoft accounting policies (see exhibit 7).
  MAP contains each of the 500 or so accounting policies that we follow,
  and it helps us ensure that data conform to common rules and
  taxonomies across the entire company. 
Because it is so easy to access and update, and because the
  information is always current, MAP is an ideal place for posting
  policies and procedures of all kinds. 
FinWeb is more than just a portal for accessing and analyzing
  corporate financial data. It's the entry point for virtually every
  transaction. FinWeb's network of Web sites includes MS Expense, which
  allows employees to submit expense reports and receive prompt
  reimbursement; MS Invoice, used by Microsoft vendors for submitting
  electronic invoices; and MS Market, our internal procurement tool. 
Another FinWeb feature is Headtrax, which shows the employment
  hierarchy at Microsoft, making it possible for managers to see which
  positions are open and which are filled in their group. It lets them
  make changes within their organizations. With Headtrax, for example, I
  can move one of my employees to another group or give a raise to
  someone who directly reports to me. Assuming I've followed all
  standard accounting and administrative policies, I can take this
  action from my computer in seconds, without generating any paperwork.
  (Of course, you can only access this confidential information if you
  have the proper approvals and clearances.) And, like all FinWeb
  transactions, any change I make immediately enters the SAP database
  and is extracted within 24 hours to a data warehouse, where it becomes
  part of the information pool available to anyone in the company who
  needs it. 

 


IMPLEMENTATION STEPS 
What are the most critical prerequisites for putting such a system
  in place? There are about a half-dozen, and they fall into two
  categories: technical and cultural. 
To most financial professionals, the technical challenges may sound
  daunting, but they are fairly straightforward. To build a financial
  digital nervous system, a company must have a robust computing
  infrastructure in which all computers share a common operating system
  and are linked by a reliable network. 
Most important to achieving such a system is the cultural context.
  In many organizations, while the information technology (IT) people
  understand technology, they don't understand business. Likewise,
  financial people understand business but may not understand
  technology. To create a system comparable to ours requires teamwork
  between the IT and finance people. 
Another essential cultural element is executive commitment. There is
  always a certain amount of discomfort when old systems are discarded
  and new ones are put in place. To implement the magnitude of change
  required to build a financial digital nervous system requires a clear
  mandate and support from executive management. An organization with a
  CEO who doesn't use a PC probably shouldn't embark on this path. 
At the same time, a certain amount of patience is required. Building
  a financial digital nervous system has been an incremental process:
  eliminating paper reports, adding a Web interface, implementing
  financial software. That process must start with a vision: information
  at your fingertips. Along the way, our idea of what is possible has
  expanded. Originally, we were pleased to reduce our closing time from
  two weeks to four days. Now we are challenging ourselves to achieve a
  continuous close, where information is accurate and current every day
  of the month. 
As we continue on this path, I see many other opportunities to
  increase the value of financial information. One project is a new data
  warehouse that will allow us to consolidate disparate types of data
  and make it possible for users to create the equivalent of a balanced
  scorecard. Another project is incorporating new OLAP services included
  in Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 to significantly increase the performance
  of our data warehouses. Finally, we are implementing
  middleware—software that will allow us to create Web-based
  applications in which users can construct queries without ever knowing
  which specific databases contain the data. Ultimately, we hope to
  create an authentic enterprise information portal, where any company
  can have its information truly at its fingertips . n 


Exhibit 2: Financial Data in a Flash 

Up-to-the-minute financial information comes to Controller Scott
    Boggs’ desktop computer regularly. In this flash report, he receives
    Microsoft’s companywide monthly and quarterly results. He can drill
    down for more detailed information. The data in this exhibit are for
    illustration purposes only. 


 


Exhibit 3: Putting Data in Perspective 

Using Excel’s PivotTable feature, Boggs can reconfigure the data so
    he can better understand how sales of different products affect the
    company’s overall revenue. 


 


Exhibit 4: Slicing and Dicing the Numbers 

Data in the PivotTable spreadsheet is sliced and diced further to
    find out what products are pushing up sales. 


 


Exhibit 5: Creating Custom Queries… 

For still more in-depth analysis, Boggs uses an internally
    developed application called MS Reports, which lets him create
    custom queries against the underlying data by dragging and dropping
    fields into a standardized template within Excel. 


 


Exhibit 6: …and Getting the Answers 

MS Reports’ interface shows in plain English the available data
    fields. Once the fields Boggs wants to examine populate the
    template, MS Reports automatically resolves it into SQL query
    language, executes the query against the data and then formats the
    results into a standard Excel spreadsheet report. 


 


Exhibit 7: Accounting Policies Database 

The key to achieving companywide uniformity with the financial data
    is an intranet site called MAP. It contains each of the 500 or so
    accounting policies Microsoft follows, helping ensure that data
    conform to common rules.
