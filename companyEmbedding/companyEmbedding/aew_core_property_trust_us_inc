Investment Strategies
Private Market - North America
For investors seeking exposure to the private real estate markets in North America, AEW offers core, value-added and opportunistic investment strategies.  Our investment strategies are steeped in research and we consistently adhere to a disciplined and time-tested investment management process. 
Core
For clients with core objectives, AEW offers an open-end commingled fund and separately managed accounts. We source, close and manage investments in the primary property types (office, industrial, retail, multifamily) in all major U.S. metropolitan markets.   Our core investment strategies seek to provide investors with an attractive total return, with an emphasis on steady generation of income.  Core investment strategies are executed by the AEW Direct Investment Group, a dedicated team that includes acquisitions, portfolio management, asset management and accounting professionals who work exclusively on direct equity portfolios.
Value-Added
For clients with value-added investment objectives, AEW offers separately-managed accounts and commingled funds.  On behalf of institutional clients, we source, close and manage investments in each of the primary property sectors, as well as in the hotel and senior housing sectors.  Our value-added investment strategies seek to provide investors with an attractive total return, comprised of current cash distributions and appreciation potential through re-positioning and other active management strategies. Value-added investment strategies are executed by the AEW Direct Investment Group.
Opportunistic
AEW was a pioneer in the development of opportunistic strategies for real estate investors, having launched our first such real estate opportunity fund in 1988. The AEW Partners Funds seek to identify and capitalize on emerging investment opportunities and trends before they become fully appreciated by the broader market, and to execute investment strategies that capitalize on those opportunities. AEW's opportunistic real estate funds target attractive total returns.   These portfolios are managed by a dedicated team of experienced acquisitions, investment management and finance professionals.
 
Disclosure:  There can be no assurances that the funds/investment strategies will achieve their objectives.
