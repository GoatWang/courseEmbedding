What Investors Need to Know About the Noble Midstream Partners IPO
The latest energy industry master limited partnership hits the market. 











                Eric Volkman
            

                (TMFVolkman)



            
            Sep 15, 2016 at 9:05AM
            
            





Big initial public offerings have been rare in recent months. IPOs of master limited partnerships, a common business structure in the oil and gas industry, have been even more rarer.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.
Noble Midstream Partners bucked both trends by taking in initial proceeds of around $281 million in its IPO, breaking down to $22.50 per unit -- beating the expected range of $19 to $21. The company makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange today. Let's take a closer look at what investors are being offered.
Sponsored by a big player
Noble Midstream Partners' sponsor is, as its name indicates, is U.S. oil and gas major Noble Energy (NYSE:NBL). A Noble Energy subsidiary, Noble Midstream GP, is the partnership's general partner. 
According to the partnership, Noble Energy's intention is to use it as the "primary vehicle" for midstream activities in this country, save for the big East Coast play, the Marcellus shale.
Noble Midstream Partners will be active in two of its sponsor's major U.S. plays, the fertile Permian Basin in Texas, and Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin. It has dedications amounting to roughly 40,000 acres in the former, while its Denver-Julesburg Basin acreage sprawls over approximately 300,000 acres.
The partnership also holds rights of first refusal to provide its services to Noble across roughly 156,000 additional acres in those plays, plus the Eagle Ford shale in Texas. It also holds ROFRs on what it terms "certain future acreage that is onshore in the United States outside of the Marcellus Shale."
As with many of its peers, Noble Midstream Partners does its business through long-term contracts at fixed fees. This eliminates much of the volatility involved in traditional oil and gas company finances.
On a pro forma basis, that activity brought in over $108 million in calendar 2015, with attributable net income coming in at nearly $54 million.
Noble Midstream Partners is beholden to pay distributions on a quarterly basis. In its prospectus, it says it will hand out a minimum of just under $0.38 per unit every quarter, or $1.50 per year. At the IPO price -- $22.50 per share -- that would yield 6.7%.
This puts it a bit on the low side in the MLP universe. Williams Partners currently yields 9.4%, and Plains All American Pipeline pays out 10.3% (although, admittedly, both stocks have been volatile over the past year). 
Noble Midstream Partners' theoretical minimum does, however, top other well-known peers such as Enterprise Products Partners and Spectra Energy Partners. 
This Fool's take
It remains to be seen whether Noble Midstream Partners will, like in its IPO, see a pop once it hits the market. That above-range IPO price is a good omen, although that success might be due more to pent-up demand for fresh stocks in general and new MLPs specifically.
That said, Noble Midstream Partners is being hitched to busy Noble Energy, which will require many of its services.
Yes, the latter company has struggled along with many of its peers in the face of stubbornly low oil prices, and is currently loss-making. But it has a number of promising plays throughout this country and a few abroad. Plus, its sales by volume have been on the rise, and it's been good about cutting costs.
So, for those investors not spooked by the weakness in oil prices and who believe in Noble Energy's future, Noble Midstream Partners could be a compelling investment.





The details
Today is Noble Midstream Partners' first day of trading on the NYSE. Its ticker symbol is NBLX. 12.5 million shares were sold in the partnership's IPO.
The lead and joint book-running managers of the IPO included JPMorgan Chase's J.P. Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Barclays.

Noble Midstream Partners LP, incorporated on December 23, 2014, is engaged in owning, operating, developing and acquiring a range of domestic midstream infrastructure assets. The Company's areas of focus are in the area of Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin in Colorado and the Southern Delaware Basin position of the Permian Basin in Texas (Delaware Basin). The Company's segments include Gathering Systems, Fresh Water Delivery, and Investments in White Cliffs and Other. The Gathering Systems segment includes crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering, as well as crude oil treating. The Company holds interest in White Cliffs Pipeline L.L.C. (the White Cliffs Interest). The Investments in White Cliffs and Other segment includes activity associated with the White Cliffs Interest. As of December 31, 2016, the White Cliffs Pipeline system consisted of two 527-mile crude oil pipelines that extended from the DJ Basin to the Cushing, Oklahoma.The Company provides crude oil, natural gas, and water-related midstream services for Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble) in the DJ Basin in Colorado through long-term, fixed-fee contracts. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had acreage dedications spanning approximately 300,000 acres in the DJ Basin and approximately 40,000 acres in Reeves County in the Delaware Basin. The Company also has rights of first refusal (ROFRs) on a combination of midstream assets in the DJ Basin, Eagle Ford Shale and Delaware Basin from Noble. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had ROFRs on approximately 85,000 additional acres in the DJ Basin, approximately 31,000 acres in the Eagle Ford Shale and approximately 40,000 acres in the Delaware Basin.Through its ownership interests in the development companies, the Company operates and owns interests in various assets, which include crude oil and natural gas gathering systems; crude oil treating facilities; produced water collection, gathering, and cleaning systems, and fresh water storage and delivery systems. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's crude oil gathering systems included approximately 87 miles of pipeline, 55 miles of which serviced the Wells Ranch integrated development plan (IDP). As of December 31, 2016, the Company's crude oil gathering assets also included 96,000 barrels of storage capacity at the Wells Ranch Central Gathering Facility (CGF). The Wells Ranch CGF separates the incoming liquid stream into pipeline-quality crude oil and produced water suitable for disposal operations. At the Wells Ranch CGF, the Company recovers gas vapors from the crude oil and delivers this natural gas to Noble for delivery to downstream third parties. As of December 31, 2016, the Company serviced the East Pony IDP through approximately 32 miles of pipeline.The Company operates two crude oil treating facilities: the Platteville and the Briggsdale facilities. These facilities service each of the IDP areas and additional wells that fall outside of these areas. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's natural gas infrastructure assets consisted of the Wells Ranch CGF and an approximately 47-mile natural gas pipeline system servicing production from the Wells Ranch IDP. The natural gas gathering system that services the production from the Wells Ranch IDP collects wet gas from separator facilities located at or near the wellhead and delivers the wet gas to the Wells Ranch CGF or other delivery points within the Wells Ranch IDP. Its Wells Ranch CGF provides condensate separation and flash gas recovery.The Company provides Noble with water-related services that are integral to Noble's upstream operations through its interests in pipelines and facilities (or under contracts with third parties), which store and distribute fresh water and collect, clean or dispose of produced water. Its midstream water assets are located in the Wells Ranch IDP and are linked to the Wells Ranch CGF. Its produced water gathering system in the Wells Ranch IDP gathers and processes liquids produced from operations and consists of a combination of separation and storage facilities, and permanent pipelines, as well as pumping stations to transport produced water to disposal facilities. As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated an approximately 55-mile gathering pipeline system (shared crude oil and produced water gathering pipeline) to service the Wells Ranch IDP. Its fresh water systems provide services for both treated produced water and raw fresh water that has been withdrawn from a river or ground water. Its fresh water services include distribution and storage services that are integral to Noble's drilling and completion operations in the DJ Basin.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
