The small department specializes in primarily enterprise IT support and maintenance of the company's point-of-sale (POS) hardware within its restaurants. The POS systems are run on Radiant Systems and utilize Aloha Guest Management Systems.

The corporate IT operations are simplistic in design and framework. Business intelligence is run on JDE and Hyperion technologies, with very little in-house accruements. HRIS has now switched to a SaaS model for its human capital management systems. The IT operations team handles general network services and day-to-day server support. The overall IT budget appears slim but the department is hopeful on potential future optimization projects.

Achieving over $1 million in savings over a five-year period

Take HCM Product Tour - Restaurants



            Key Benefits
        





Frees IT team to focus on other core business and technology initiatives


Enables immediate adjustments for business changes through highly configurable SaaS platform


Deepens longstanding partnership with Ultimate

 




            Overview
            
Based in Louisville, Kentucky, Texas Roadhouse first opened its doors in 1993. It has since grown to operate more than 460 restaurants in 49 U.S. states and 5 locations across the globe. The company is famous for hand-cut steaks, made-from-scratch sides, fresh-baked bread, and its lively atmosphere. In 2007 and 2008, Forbes magazine ranked the company as one of the 200 Best Small Companies, and in 2009 the company was ranked “Best Value” by readers of Consumer Reports magazine.





40,000 employees


            Challenges
        
In 2003, Texas Roadhouse was using a payroll service bureau to handle people management for its thousands of employees located across the U.S. The restaurant chain selected UltiPro in December 2004 to achieve higher levels of control, flexibility, unified HR and payroll functionality, and customizable reporting and business intelligence. After tremendous expansion, the company decided it was time to leverage more of UltiPro’s functionality—however new hardware and resources would be needed to accommodate it.  After a seven-year partnership driven by exceptional service and business partnership with Ultimate Software, Texas Roadhouse decided to take advantage of cloud delivery. With this cost-effective platform, Ultimate Software handles the hardware, system maintenance, and upgrades for its customers—which frees HR and IT teams to focus on other core business projects.

            Solutions
        
With Ultimate’s SaaS, business partners like Texas Roadhouse can take advantage of the agility, simplicity, and affordability of a cloud-delivered HCM solution—without the high costs or range of complexities that comes with implementing and maintaining a traditional, on-premise system. Plus, Ultimate Software’s tenured, certified professionals handle all the UltiPro-related maintenance; apply new version upgrades; and maintain all the hardware, software, and customer data at multiple, secured data centers. This cost-saving, powerful approach delivers a full range of business results, including advanced functionality, improved efficiencies, more control over HCM, and a rapid, measurable ROI. “UltiPro has proven to be all we envisioned and much more,” said Vickie Elder, senior payroll manager for Texas Roadhouse, Inc. “And we love that our platform is backed by a customer service team that is truly exceptional in the HCM industry—everyone at Ultimate Software is uniformly responsive, knowledgeable, and conscientious. We’re very excited that UltiPro’s cloud capabilities enable us to leverage Ultimate’s great support services at an even deeper level.” Ultimate’s cloud technology is deployed via the Web and runs behind a firewall on a local area network or personal computer. This scalable, cost-efficient delivery model offers a reduced cost of ownership by minimizing the expenses of buying, implementing, upgrading, and maintaining on-premise software applications. Large companies like Texas Roadhouse can save thousands to hundreds of thousands annually on capital costs associated with on-premise software—not to mention additional savings by reducing or eliminating operational costs for implementation, support, training, upgrades, enhancements, and more. “We made the decision to switch to the cloud platform because it makes better sense and delivers more value for our business—and because we have unequivocal trust in Ultimate Software,” said Mark Simpson, senior director of people for Texas Roadhouse, Inc. “Ultimate Software has been offering cloud services since 2002, and the company knows how to deliver premium technology and expert customer support. UltiPro is now delivering a higher level of HCM advantages across our business, especially transparent upgrades as well as reduced IT expenses and responsibilities.” “We have an excellent relationship with Ultimate Software, and it’s because the company treats us like strategic business partners,” said Patrick Sterling, director of risk and people administration for Texas Roadhouse, Inc. “With UltiPro, we’ve saved $1.5 million over six years. Plus, having control of our data gives us the flexibility and speed we need to provide on-demand critical data to company leadership. We’re very pleased that we are now experiencing full HCM advantages through superior cloud technology.”

steakhouse you don't have to worry about being messy at

                        I love going to Texas Roadhouse...This place is what a steakhouse should be like. If you're going in for dinner, prepare to wait a bit. But while you're waiting, endulge in the free peanuts. You can just drop the shells on the ground. Cool, huh?

The food is also great. I personally like the ribs a lot more than the steak. But the steak is great too. They serve these delicious rolls before your meal. I usually eat so many of them that I can't finish my actual meal. Be prepared to spend about $15 a person. It's worth it though.

A Man's Meal

                        Texas Roadhouse is the best place a man can go. with free peanuts and free bread, who can ask for more? but wait, it does get better. with hearty meals like steak and chicken, it's not for people with a small stomach. it WILL fulfill your needs if you are hungry. the price is great too. not that expensive. only downfall is the line. because it's so good, many people go there.

Lovely Dining!

                        Texas Roadhouse provides you a waiting area with peanuts so you don't need to wait outside like other restuarants...and if you're waiting long, at least you won't starve! I absolutely LOVE the bread! It is AWESOME! a MUST try.  The workers are very kind and very amazing.  The waiter I had memorized everyones orders and made no mistakes.  We were a party of 8 and each person had a meal where it comes with 2 things like baked potatoes, soup, etc. so it was very amazing how he didn't have to write anything down.

Good Food at Good Prices

                        They really have great bread. I think the bread is so good that I will go there just for the bread. They also have this cinnamon butter that is irresistable which even enhances the bread even more. The steaks are awesome because when you ask for medium rare, they really do give you a slab of juicy medium rare steak! The service there is amazing and my food came almost instantly after I ordered!

texas road house

                        Texas road house is one of the worst place i have ever eaten at before. The service is horriable. I do not recommend anyone to come to this place because oh the poor service their ok food. Sure they may seem nice but if it takes 30 minutes to make a salads then theres a problem at the place now. But if you want to try their food then go to another one maybe a one that you can find that is actually good and has some service.
