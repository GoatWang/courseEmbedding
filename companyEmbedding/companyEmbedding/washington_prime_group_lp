(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report. Overview - Basis of Presentation   The O'Connor Joint Venture II During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we completed an additional joint venture transaction with O'Connor, an unaffiliated third party and our partner in the O'Connor Joint Venture I, with respect to the ownership and operation of seven of the Company's retail properties and certain related outparcels (the "O'Connor Joint Venture II"), consisting of the following: The Arboretum, located in Austin, Texas; Arbor Hills, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Classen Curve and The Triangle at Classen Curve, each located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills Plaza, located in Nichols Hills, Oklahoma (the "Oklahoma City Properties," collectively); Gateway Centers, located in Austin, Texas; Malibu Lumber Yard, located in Malibu, California; Palms Crossing I and II, located in McAllen, Texas and The Shops at Arbor Walk, located in Austin, Texas. The transaction valued the properties at $598.6 million before closing adjustments and debt assumptions. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, we retained a non-controlling 51% interest in the O'Connor Joint Venture II and sold the remaining 49% to O'Connor. The transaction generated net proceeds to the Company of approximately $138.9 million, after taking into consideration costs associated with the transaction and the assumption of debt (including the new mortgage loans on The Arboretum, Gateway Centers, and Oklahoma City Properties which closed prior to the joint venture transaction; see "Financing and Debt" below for net proceeds to the Company from the new mortgage loans), which we used to reduce the Company's debt, as well as for general corporate purposes. Since we no longer control the operations of the properties included in the O'Connor Joint Venture II, we deconsolidated the properties and recorded a gain in connection with this partial sale of $126.1 million, which is included in gain (loss) on disposition of interests in properties, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The gain was recorded pursuant to ASC 360-20 and calculated based upon proceeds received, less 49% of the book value of the deconsolidated net assets. Our retained 51% non-controlling equity method interest was valued at historical cost based upon the pro rata book value of the retained interest in the net assets. We retained management and leasing responsibilities of the properties, though our partner's substantive participating rights over the decisions most important to the operations of the O'Connor Joint Venture II preclude our control and consolidation of this venture. In connection with the formation of this joint venture, we recorded transaction costs of approximately $5.4 million as part of our basis in this investment. Impairment  Portfolio Data   June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016 % Change Ending occupancy (1) 92.3% 93.0% (0.7)% Average base minimum rent per square foot (2) $21.63 $21.61 0.1%  (1) Ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area, or GLA, which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all Company-owned space except for anchors, majors, freestanding office and outlots at our enclosed retail properties in the calculation of ending occupancy. Community shopping center GLA included in the calculation relates to all Company-owned space other than office space.  (2) Average base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy.  Current Leasing Activities   On January 10, 2017, we completed the sale of Virginia Center Commons, located in Glen Allen, Virginia.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 vs. Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Minimum rents decreased $17.8 million primarily due to a $17.6 million decrease attributable to the Property Transactions and a $4.7 million decrease attributable to the O'Connor Properties, offset by a $4.5 million net increase attributable to the comparable properties, primarily attributable to fair value of leases and straight-line amortization and recent development activity coming online. Overage rents decreased $1.2 million due to a $0.4 million decrease attributable to the Property Transactions, a $0.3 million decrease attributable to the O'Connor Properties, and a $0.5 million decrease attributable to the comparable properties. Tenant reimbursements decreased $8.5 million due to a $7.0 million decrease attributable to the Property Transactions, a $1.0 million decrease attributable to the O'Connor Properties, and a $0.5 million decrease attributable to the comparable properties. Other income increased $3.3 million, primarily due to a $2.3 million increase attributable to lease settlements that occurred in 2017, a $0.7 million increase attributable to ancillary property income, and a $0.3 million increase in management, leasing and development fee income from the unconsolidated joint ventures to which we provide such services. Property operating expenses decreased $11.1 million, of which $7.8 million was attributable to the Property Transactions, $0.4 million was attributable to the O'Connor Properties, and $2.9 million was attributable to the comparable properties, primarily involving a reduction in management fee expense related to the termination of certain transition service agreements with Simon Property Group, Inc. in connection with the 2014 spin-off. Depreciation and amortization decreased $6.5 million, primarily due to a $9.3 million decrease attributable to the Property Transactions and a $2.1 million decrease attributable to the O'Connor Properties, offset by a $4.9 million increase attributable to the comparable properties, which was primarily due to development assets placed into service. Real estate taxes decreased $1.6 million, primarily due to a $4.0 million decrease attributable to the Property Transactions and a $0.3 million decrease attributable to the O'Connor Properties, offset by a $2.7 million increase attributable to the comparable properties, which was primarily due to a real estate tax refund related to Westminster Mall during 2016 that did not occur in 2017. Provision for credit losses increased $1.0 million, primarily attributable to an increase in tenant bankruptcies during 2017. General and administrative expenses decreased $2.3 million, primarily due to a reduction in legal, consulting, and audit fees. The decrease in merger, restructuring and transaction costs of $29.9 million was attributable to the management transition as well as strategic alternatives explored during 2016. The $8.5 million impairment loss recorded in 2017 related to the write down of Morgantown Commons, as described in further detail under "Impairment." Interest expense, net, decreased $8.0 million, of which $5.5 million was attributable to the Property Transactions, $1.1 million was attributable to the payoff of the mortgage loan secured by Mesa Mall, $0.8 million was attributable to the O'Connor Properties and $3.0 million was attributable to swap ineffectiveness recognized in the 2016 period. Offsetting these decreases were increases of $1.8 million related to default interest on properties transitioned, or to be transitioned, to lender, and $0.6 million related to other financing activities.  Our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased $17.4 million during 2017 to $76.8 million as of June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to operating cash flow from properties, net distributions from our joint ventures, and the net proceeds from the disposition of properties, partially offset by net repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and capital expenditures. See "Cash Flows" below for more information.   funded net amounts of restricted cash reserves held for future capital expenditures of $2.0 million; . . .

Washington Prime Group Completes Acquisition of Glimcher Realty Trust; Company to Be Known as WP GLIMCHER | Business Wire
























































Washington Prime Group Completes Acquisition of Glimcher Realty 
      Trust; Company to Be Known as WP GLIMCHER






January 15, 2015 10:04 AM Eastern Standard Time



BETHESDA, Md. & COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Washington Prime Group Inc. (“Washington Prime”) (NYSE:WPG) today 
      announced it has completed the previously announced acquisition of 
      Glimcher Realty Trust (“Glimcher”). The company will be known as WP 
      GLIMCHER, and continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the 
      ticker WPG.
    


      Mark S. Ordan, Executive Chairman of WP GLIMCHER said, “We are very 
      pleased to have completed our acquisition of Glimcher so quickly, which 
      will allow us to begin taking advantage of the strengths of the combined 
      company, including a broad and diverse group of strong cash flowing 
      assets and a strong platform in Columbus as a foundation for growth.”
    

      Michael P. Glimcher, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of WP 
      GLIMCHER said, “This transaction delivers immediate benefit to Glimcher 
      shareholders and creates a combined company and team positioned to 
      deliver enhanced shareholder value.”
    

      Mr. Ordan added “We are focused on reducing leverage, including through 
      joint ventures and possible asset sales, maintaining our investment 
      grade rating, strengthening our asset base through development and 
      redevelopment opportunities, and strategically acquiring new properties 
      in both enclosed and open air large format shopping centers that have a 
      long term place in their markets.”
    

      Mark Ordan, CEO of Washington Prime, will serve as Executive Chairman of 
      the combined company’s Board of Directors and Michael Glimcher, CEO of 
      Glimcher, will serve as the combined company’s CEO and Vice Chairman, 
      reporting to Mr. Ordan. Michael Glimcher and Niles Overly have also been 
      appointed to the WP GLIMCHER Board of Directors and will join Washington 
      Prime’s highly qualified group of existing directors, all of whom will 
      continue as directors of WP GLIMCHER. In connection with the closing of 
      the acquisition, Glimcher’s shares will cease trading on the NYSE after 
      January 15, 2015.
    

Transaction Details


      As previously announced, under the terms of the merger agreement, 
      Glimcher shareholders will receive, for each Glimcher share, $10.40 in 
      cash and 0.1989 of a share in WPG common stock. Additionally, in 
      connection with the close of the transaction, Simon Property Group, Inc. 
      (“Simon”) has also completed its previously announced acquisition of 
      Jersey Gardens in Elizabeth, New Jersey and University Park Village in 
      Fort Worth, Texas, properties previously owned by Glimcher, for an 
      aggregate purchase price of $1.09 billion, including the assumption of 
      existing mortgage debt.
    

      Washington Prime Group, L.P. has entered into a 364-day bridge term loan 
      agreement with certain lenders and drew down an aggregate $1.19 billion 
      to finance a portion of the transaction.
    

      Citi is serving as financial advisor, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz 
      is serving as legal advisor, to Washington Prime. Willkie Farr & 
      Gallagher LLP is serving as legal advisor to Washington Prime in 
      connection with the sale of the two Glimcher properties to Simon.
    

      GreenOak Real Estate US LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are serving as 
      financial advisors, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is serving as 
      legal advisor to Glimcher.
    

      WP GLIMCHER expects to issue fiscal year end 2014 earnings in late 
      February, which will provide updated financial information and guidance 
      for the newly combined company.
