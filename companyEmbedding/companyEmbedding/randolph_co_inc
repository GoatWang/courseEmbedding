 Anti-Slip Coatings
Don’t Let Safety Slip! Prevent Slips and Falls with Tough Non- Skid Coatings.
         
Combat slips and trips in the workplace with Randolph Products’ Anti-Slip product line. Injuries due to slips and falls are a major source of accidents and death. These accidents in the workplace and public places cost employers and companies billions of dollars each year. The National Safety Council (NSC) estimates that workers’ compensation and medical costs associated with employee slip-and-fall accidents are approximately $70 billion annually. Anti slip coatings save lives. Our anti-slip coatings are engineered to meet  the requirements of ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) and OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) guidelines and are recognized for preventing slips and falls.
The facts:

$70 billion annual costs associated to slip-and-fall accidents
Loss of productivity from days away from work (median 8-9 days)
Leading cause of death in the workplace
Cause of more than 20 percent of all disabling injuries

Our large range of anti-slip floor coatings is ideal for securing wet or slippery areas. We offer durable products in a wide range of colors and grades to keep your business safe. Please use the links below to explore our industrial grade anti slip coatings.
