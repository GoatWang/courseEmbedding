About us
Jupiter combines the spirit and flair of an investment boutique with the strength and resources of an established institution. 










Jupiter is an established fund management group that seeks to add value for our clients through the delivery of outperformance over the medium to long term. Our origins go back to 1985 as a specialist investment boutique founded in London. Since then we have expanded beyond the UK as retail and institutional investors have been attracted to our active approach to asset management. 

Although we are now too large to be considered a boutique – we manage £43.5 billion in total* – we work hard on retaining our boutique culture. We believe this is why some of the finest fund managers in the industry choose to pursue their careers with us.

OUR HISTORY

OUR PHILOSOPHY

*As at 31 March 2017.

our philosophy





Jupiter combines the spirit and flair of an investment boutique with the strength and resources of an established institution. As active fund managers we aim to deliver outperformance against the market over the medium to long term. 

Our investment culture promotes freedom of thought among our fund managers and encourages them to manage money in line with their individual styles, subject to mandate restrictions and risk requirements.

Latest news at Jupiter





Alan Barth, editor of The Washington Post from 1943 to 1972, once wrote: News is only the first rough draft of history. Framed in this way, news carries weight. 
When creating the “news” within a company – doing those things that are worth reporting about – a corollary to Barth’s might be actions bear responsibility. It is with this frame of mind we seek to grow and develop our business and better the service we provide to our clients. 
The news found here is the first rough draft of our evolving history.

Jupiter Denied Merger Talks With Macquarie
Mar 16 17
Maarten Slendebroek, Chief Executive of Jupiter Asset Management Limited, said that Jupitar is not looking to be acquired by anyone. Earlier Macquarie Group Limited (ASX : MQG) was reportedly looking to acquire Jupiter.


Macquarie Reportedly In Talks To Acquire Jupiter
Oct 31 16
Speculation that Macquarie Group Limited (ASX:MQG) is looking to acquire Jupiter Asset Management Limited has been met with silence from both firms. The Australian reported over the weekend that Macquarie was eyeing the UK asset manager as the fall of the British pound made it a more attractive takeover target. It reported the Australian bank has been on the lookout for offshore acquisitions as it seeks to diversify its revenues. Both firms responded that they would be making “no comment” on the market speculation.
