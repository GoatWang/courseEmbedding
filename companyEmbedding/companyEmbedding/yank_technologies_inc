Bob Kot
 Advisor at POUNCE Systems


                                    Josh is an extraordinarily focused and bright entrepreneur who overcomes  the obstacles that every start-up CEO faces. He is a great team builder and business leader with the required technical skills to lead product development while developing the path towards commercialization.                                












Darren MacDonald



                                    As a seasoned investor, mentor and co-founder of the non profit Entrepreneurs Alliance, I have been fortunate to work with a number of start-ups.  Josh possesses the poise, persistence and passion to move past obstacles that hold many young entrepreneurs back. Josh is developing a disruptive breakthrough in wireless charging technology which has numerous capabilities in various markets.  YT has high growth potential, couple that with an effective go-to-market strategy, lean production process and a seasoned executive team and the company will find blue sky.
