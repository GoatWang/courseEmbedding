Panasonic LabAlert Monitoring System

The protection and monitoring of valuable samples within laboratories, biorepositories and biobanks has become increasingly important in biomedical, life sciences and clinical research. When temperature fluctuations occur within a refrigerator or freezer your irreplaceable samples are at risk and could potentially cost you your entire life’s work of research, time and money. With Panasonic’s LabAlert system, these potential hazards are minimized with an advanced mobile monitoring system to keep track of your laboratory even when you are not there. From ULT Freezers to Incubators and Clean Rooms, the LabAlert system will track temperatures, pressure, humidity levels, door status, leaks and more providing you with a complete end-to-end wireless monitoring solution for all your laboratory equipment.

                    At nearly a mile in length, Big River Crossing is the longest public pedestrian bridge across the Mississippi River. 

Big River Crossing is also the country¿s longest active rail/bicycle/pedestrian bridge. It serves as the connection point of Main Street to Main Street, a 10-mile multi-modal corridor that also features the Delta Regional River Park and Big River Trail, creating ties to attractions between Memphis, TN and West Memphis, AR. 

No matter how you travel it, Big River Crossing provides opportunities for recreation and fitness with a whole new point of view.

                    I am a native Memphian, and I love Memphis because there are so many great things to say about the River City that I really don't know where to start; from the Mississippi River, the Pyramid, Elvis Presley, Beale Street, Orpheum Theatre (Broadway plays and musicals), Overton Park with the Memphis Zoo, one of the top zoo's in the nation, Pink Palace Museum, Children's Museum, Levitt Shell (free outdoor concerts), Brooks Art Gallery, the medical center including St. Jude, Le Bonheur and a Level 1 Trauma Center, Amtrak to New Orleans and Chicago, fabulous restaurants and the Green Line to Shelby Farms, the largest urban park in the United States.  Because I'm a native Memphian I have extensive knowledge and a wealth of information on neighborhoods, parks, communities, schools (public and private), restaurants, shopping, etc.  Please send me an email or text requesting information on whatever would interest you about Memphis, and I will reply back quickly.
