High-end, high-quality wood components for custom cabinetry.
Meridian Products designs and crafts doors and drawer fronts, drawer boxes, face frames and moldings, cabinetry components and architectural details. Using the classic mortise and tenon joinery method, we build one of the industry’s strongest and most stable miter doors available. The same mastery goes into our dovetailed drawer boxes, and raised and recessed panels.
