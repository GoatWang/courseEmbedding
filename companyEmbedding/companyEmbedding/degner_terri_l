TLA Designs
















I believe that one space should gracefully flow into the next, whether it’s dining room to den, or bedroom to balcony.

— Terri
Terri L. AndrewsDesigning since 1985, Terri L. Andrews of TLA Designs Ltd. is an interior designer specializing in luxury residential projects in California, Nevada and the Caribbean.Terri uniquely manages her design projects in a way that most interior designers don’t – making her an invaluable asset to any new construction or significant renovation project. She joins forces with architects, artisans and contractors from the initial planning stages all the way through to project completion. Being an extension of the “client team” from the outset, allows Terri to advocate for her clients ensuring that their design goals are met at every level.Terri’s clients trust her because she listens to their vision, anticipates their needs and stretches their imagination. She likes to say that she designs “with a twist” which allows her to achieve a special uniqueness with each and every project. The end result is finished designs that are a careful composition of form, function and style.Meet TerriTerri L. Andrews brings more than 25 years of experience to TLA Designs Ltd. Nearly a decade ago, her love for Caribbean life, people and culture led her to become a part-time island resident, where she has focused her most recent work.Terri lives her life with a true California sensibility and loves to weave her unique west-coast style into each project. She designs with the intent to integrate interior and exterior spaces as much as possible - putting an emphasis on openness, light and usage of space.In order to design with cohesion, Terri works hand-in-hand with her clients from the early stages of planning and construction through project completion. Maintaining this connection from the inception means that she can lend her expertise and love for small but significant details like the placement of personal artifacts and warm, intentional lighting.  She is passionate about every project she undertakes and works tirelessly as a true advocate for her clients.When not working with clients on new design projects, Terri is likely traveling the globe, collecting new inspirations or splitting time between her homes in California, Nevada and the Caribbean. She is passionate about animals and sports, and competes regularly in USTA tennis leagues.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.
