How I can help you


	I'm the business strategy guy--specifically, I have over 30 years experience in working in two areas, namely:(1)  I work with inventors who have an idea for a new product or service and want to know how to move forward with their new invention idea-patent or otherwise, and (2) I work with people that have an idea for a new business and/or want to add a new product to an existing business and want to know if this makes economic sense. I can provide guidance in writing a business plan and, in particular, can help with the market assessment and market strategy approach. I am currently the President/CEO of a 30-year old market and information research company where we provide services to individuals and companies that need information and market research services. I have extensive experience in the aerospace and government contracting areas having worked in business development and program/project management for such companies as North American Rockwell, Hughes Aircraft Company, Ultra-Systems, Inc. and the Boeing Company. Specific technology areas of interest and experience include military electronics, information systems and environmental technologies.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
