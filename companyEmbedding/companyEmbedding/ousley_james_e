SAVVIS Names Jonathan C. Crane President; James E. Ousley Elected Chairman of the Board  


ST. LOUIS, MO — May 31, 2006 —SAVVIS, Inc. (NASDAQ:SVVS), a leading global provider of managed and outsourced IT services, today announced that effective immediately Jonathan C. Crane, formerly chairman of the board of directors, has been named president of SAVVIS reporting directly to chief executive officer, Philip J. Koen. James E. Ousley, an independent board member, has been elected chairman of the board, replacing Crane. The company also announced the resignation of Jack Finlayson as a member of the board of directors and as president and chief operating officer. Mr. Finlayson, who has decided to pursue other leadership opportunities, will remain with the company through June 30 in an advisory role to ensure an orderly transition.
Crane, 56, was elected to SAVVIS’ board in March 2006. He previously served as executive vice president of corporate development and chief strategy officer at MCI where he led company growth initiatives, including the strategic redirection of MCI/WorldCom and the recent merger of MCI and Verizon. Ousley, 60, has served on SAVVIS’ board of directors since 2002, and is a member of the audit and compensation committees. He was formerly president and CEO of Vytek Wireless, Inc.
Commenting on the management changes, Phil Koen said, “We are delighted to welcome Jonathan to a more hands-on role at SAVVIS. His talent and expertise in strategic and operational business management, and considerable experience in the technology infrastructure industry, will be critical in replacing Jack Finlayson, who has been a major force in SAVVIS’ growth over the past six years. Jack’s commitment to SAVVIS helped drive the company’s record sales success and strong improvements in financial performance and capital structure. We are grateful for his efforts in positioning SAVVIS for future success. Jim Ousley, an independent member of our board, brings strong leadership and an extensive knowledge of our company and industry to his role as chairman of the board. I am delighted to work with both of these experienced industry leaders as we continue to drive SAVVIS to new levels of success.”
Jonathan Crane, SAVVIS president, said, “SAVVIS is ideally positioned to deliver on its full potential in providing integrated, end-to-end IT infrastructure solutions to enterprises, and to capitalize on growing demand for those solutions. I am very pleased to expand my role in the company at this exciting point in its development, and to join with Phil and Jim to lead SAVVIS’ continued transformation.”
Jack Finlayson said, “Helping lead SAVVIS’ growth over the past six years has been exciting and fulfilling. The company has built a great team, and I’ve been proud to be part of that. I look forward to pursuing new leadership opportunities, knowing SAVVIS is in excellent hands with a strong management team.”
A 30-year veteran of the communications industry, Crane spent nine years leading MCI’s multi-national account sales organization and built strategic business sales and marketing initiatives targeted at winning and retaining some of MCI’s largest corporate customers. Prior to joining MCI, Jonathan Crane held CEO positions at several technology companies. Most recently, he was chairman and CEO of Adero, Inc., an Internet-based content distribution company. Previously, he was chairman and CEO of Marcam Solutions, Inc., an ERP software company focused on manufacturing, customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain management applications. Crane also served as COO for Geotek as well as CEO of Lightstream.
Crane began his career in 1973 in sales, marketing and product management for Bell of Pennsylvania, holding subsequent sales positions at Rolm Corporation and Sonecor, a division of SNET. He holds a bachelor’s degree in History and Education from Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.
Jim Ousley served as the president and chief executive officer and director of Vytek Wireless, Inc. from 2001 until April 2004. From 1999 to 2002, he also served as chairman, CEO and president of Syntegra Inc. (USA), a division of British Telecommunications. From September 1991 to August 1999, Ousley served as president and CEO of Control Data Systems. In addition to SAVVIS’ board of directors, Ousley serves on the boards of Activcard Corp., Bell Microproducts, Inc. and Datalink, Inc. He received a B.S. from the University of Nebraska.
