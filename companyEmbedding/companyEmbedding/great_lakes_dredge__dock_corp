History[edit]




Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company project manager Brian Puckett explains dredging operations to US Vice President Joe Biden aboard Dredge 54 on the Delaware River in Philadelphia[2]


The company was founded in 1890 as the partnership of William A. Lydon & Fred C. Drews and was named Lydon & Drews dredging company. Early projects included the shoreline structures for the Chicago's Columbian Exposition. The company soon had satellite operations throughout the Great Lakes. It was renamed the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company (GLD&D) in 1905. Between 1900 and 1950, GLD&D undertook major projects such as the Sabin Lock, straightening of the Chicago River west of the Chicago Loop, the Michigan Avenue Bridge, foundation landfill and reclamation of the area where the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum, Soldier Field, Meigs Field and Field Museum of Natural History stand today in Chicago and harbor work for the Naval Station Great Lakes.[3]
During the Second World War, GLD&D constructed the MacArthur Lock. After the Second World War, GLD&D participated in extensive oil-related dredging in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1979, Great Lakes International Inc. (GLI) was included as a holding company for GLD&D. From 1985 to 1998, GLI was acquired by several companies to include ITEL Corporation, Blackstone Dredging Partners and Vectura Holding Company (Citigroup) until being purchased by Madison Dearborn Partners in 2003 for $340 million.[3][4] It was spun off a publicly traded company on NASDAQ in 2006 after the Madison's special-purpose acquisition company Aldabra Acquisition Corp merged with it. Aldabra in turn changed its name to Great Lakes Dredge and Dock.[5] Madison sold the last of its shares in 2009.[4]
1992 Chicago flood[edit]
Main article: Chicago flood
In 1992, a barge operated by GLD&D was driving new pilings for the Kinzie Street Bridge in Chicago when it accidentally punched into an unused service tunnel passing beneath the river at that point. The tunnel flooded, in turn flooding the basements of many buildings in downtown Chicago; the event is commonly known as the Chicago Flood. Work on the bridge was actually completed the prior year October, 1991. In February 1992 local cable company technicians discovered the breach and reported it to city officials. GLD&D was never made aware of the breach until April 1992 after severe leakage into the tunnel system had begun.
The work performed on the Kinzie Street Bridge conformed to specifications and did pass City inspection upon completion in 1991.
In the lawsuits that followed Great Lakes was initially found liable but was later cleared after it was revealed that the city was aware the tunnel was leaking before the flood and the city had also not properly maintained the tunnel.[6][7]
In addition the case went the United States Supreme Court in Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. - 513 U.S. 527 (1994) which ruled that since the work was being done by a vessel in navigable waters of the Chicago River, Admiralty law applied and Great Lakes liability was greatly limited.[8]
2008 Liberian freighter collision[edit]
In January 2008, a 117 ft. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company dredge in Newark Bay was struck by a 669-ft Liberian-flagged orange juice freighter named the Orange Sun. Newark Bay had to be closed for five hours by the U.S. Coast Guard until damages to the GLD&D dredge were mitigated. The dredge had begun to take on water and a diving crew was sent in order to make repairs.[9] In December 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a report that blamed the Orange Sun for the accident. The Orange Sun's master had not informed the captain or crew about the ship's tendency to deviate from its course.[10]
Jersey Shore[edit]
The company was hired to build dunes and berms along 22 miles of the Jersey Shore damaged by Hurricane Sandy.[11]
Operations[edit]
Great Lakes Dredge and Dock conducts most of its operations within the United States and 25% of its operations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. GLD&D dredging operations consist of deepening and maintaining waterways, shipping channels, and ports; creating and maintaining (re-nourishing) beaches; excavating new harbors; reclaiming land in the water or improving low-lying land areas; restoring aquatic and wetland habitats and excavating pipeline, cable and tunnel trenches.[3]
In 1990, GLD&D renewed its overseas efforts and created a foreign division. By 1993, GLD&D was awarded significant projects in the Middle East. Soon projects in Europe, Africa, Mexico and South America would begin as well. GLD&D also provided excavation and reclamation for the Oresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden.[3]
In 2003, GLD&D performed dredging of the Umm Qasr Port in Iraq. GLD&D also constructed a port in Hidd, Bahrain around the same time.[3] In June 2010, GLD&D under the Shaw Environmental and Infrastructure Group began constructing sand berms off the Louisiana coast to limit the amount of approaching oil in the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.[12]

History[edit]




Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company project manager Brian Puckett explains dredging operations to US Vice President Joe Biden aboard Dredge 54 on the Delaware River in Philadelphia[2]


The company was founded in 1890 as the partnership of William A. Lydon & Fred C. Drews and was named Lydon & Drews dredging company. Early projects included the shoreline structures for the Chicago's Columbian Exposition. The company soon had satellite operations throughout the Great Lakes. It was renamed the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company (GLD&D) in 1905. Between 1900 and 1950, GLD&D undertook major projects such as the Sabin Lock, straightening of the Chicago River west of the Chicago Loop, the Michigan Avenue Bridge, foundation landfill and reclamation of the area where the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum, Soldier Field, Meigs Field and Field Museum of Natural History stand today in Chicago and harbor work for the Naval Station Great Lakes.[3]
During the Second World War, GLD&D constructed the MacArthur Lock. After the Second World War, GLD&D participated in extensive oil-related dredging in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1979, Great Lakes International Inc. (GLI) was included as a holding company for GLD&D. From 1985 to 1998, GLI was acquired by several companies to include ITEL Corporation, Blackstone Dredging Partners and Vectura Holding Company (Citigroup) until being purchased by Madison Dearborn Partners in 2003 for $340 million.[3][4] It was spun off a publicly traded company on NASDAQ in 2006 after the Madison's special-purpose acquisition company Aldabra Acquisition Corp merged with it. Aldabra in turn changed its name to Great Lakes Dredge and Dock.[5] Madison sold the last of its shares in 2009.[4]
1992 Chicago flood[edit]
Main article: Chicago flood
In 1992, a barge operated by GLD&D was driving new pilings for the Kinzie Street Bridge in Chicago when it accidentally punched into an unused service tunnel passing beneath the river at that point. The tunnel flooded, in turn flooding the basements of many buildings in downtown Chicago; the event is commonly known as the Chicago Flood. Work on the bridge was actually completed the prior year October, 1991. In February 1992 local cable company technicians discovered the breach and reported it to city officials. GLD&D was never made aware of the breach until April 1992 after severe leakage into the tunnel system had begun.
The work performed on the Kinzie Street Bridge conformed to specifications and did pass City inspection upon completion in 1991.
In the lawsuits that followed Great Lakes was initially found liable but was later cleared after it was revealed that the city was aware the tunnel was leaking before the flood and the city had also not properly maintained the tunnel.[6][7]
In addition the case went the United States Supreme Court in Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. - 513 U.S. 527 (1994) which ruled that since the work was being done by a vessel in navigable waters of the Chicago River, Admiralty law applied and Great Lakes liability was greatly limited.[8]
2008 Liberian freighter collision[edit]
In January 2008, a 117 ft. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company dredge in Newark Bay was struck by a 669-ft Liberian-flagged orange juice freighter named the Orange Sun. Newark Bay had to be closed for five hours by the U.S. Coast Guard until damages to the GLD&D dredge were mitigated. The dredge had begun to take on water and a diving crew was sent in order to make repairs.[9] In December 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a report that blamed the Orange Sun for the accident. The Orange Sun's master had not informed the captain or crew about the ship's tendency to deviate from its course.[10]
Jersey Shore[edit]
The company was hired to build dunes and berms along 22 miles of the Jersey Shore damaged by Hurricane Sandy.[11]
Operations[edit]
Great Lakes Dredge and Dock conducts most of its operations within the United States and 25% of its operations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. GLD&D dredging operations consist of deepening and maintaining waterways, shipping channels, and ports; creating and maintaining (re-nourishing) beaches; excavating new harbors; reclaiming land in the water or improving low-lying land areas; restoring aquatic and wetland habitats and excavating pipeline, cable and tunnel trenches.[3]
In 1990, GLD&D renewed its overseas efforts and created a foreign division. By 1993, GLD&D was awarded significant projects in the Middle East. Soon projects in Europe, Africa, Mexico and South America would begin as well. GLD&D also provided excavation and reclamation for the Oresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden.[3]
In 2003, GLD&D performed dredging of the Umm Qasr Port in Iraq. GLD&D also constructed a port in Hidd, Bahrain around the same time.[3] In June 2010, GLD&D under the Shaw Environmental and Infrastructure Group began constructing sand berms off the Louisiana coast to limit the amount of approaching oil in the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.[12]

History[edit]




Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company project manager Brian Puckett explains dredging operations to US Vice President Joe Biden aboard Dredge 54 on the Delaware River in Philadelphia[2]


The company was founded in 1890 as the partnership of William A. Lydon & Fred C. Drews and was named Lydon & Drews dredging company. Early projects included the shoreline structures for the Chicago's Columbian Exposition. The company soon had satellite operations throughout the Great Lakes. It was renamed the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company (GLD&D) in 1905. Between 1900 and 1950, GLD&D undertook major projects such as the Sabin Lock, straightening of the Chicago River west of the Chicago Loop, the Michigan Avenue Bridge, foundation landfill and reclamation of the area where the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum, Soldier Field, Meigs Field and Field Museum of Natural History stand today in Chicago and harbor work for the Naval Station Great Lakes.[3]
During the Second World War, GLD&D constructed the MacArthur Lock. After the Second World War, GLD&D participated in extensive oil-related dredging in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1979, Great Lakes International Inc. (GLI) was included as a holding company for GLD&D. From 1985 to 1998, GLI was acquired by several companies to include ITEL Corporation, Blackstone Dredging Partners and Vectura Holding Company (Citigroup) until being purchased by Madison Dearborn Partners in 2003 for $340 million.[3][4] It was spun off a publicly traded company on NASDAQ in 2006 after the Madison's special-purpose acquisition company Aldabra Acquisition Corp merged with it. Aldabra in turn changed its name to Great Lakes Dredge and Dock.[5] Madison sold the last of its shares in 2009.[4]
1992 Chicago flood[edit]
Main article: Chicago flood
In 1992, a barge operated by GLD&D was driving new pilings for the Kinzie Street Bridge in Chicago when it accidentally punched into an unused service tunnel passing beneath the river at that point. The tunnel flooded, in turn flooding the basements of many buildings in downtown Chicago; the event is commonly known as the Chicago Flood. Work on the bridge was actually completed the prior year October, 1991. In February 1992 local cable company technicians discovered the breach and reported it to city officials. GLD&D was never made aware of the breach until April 1992 after severe leakage into the tunnel system had begun.
The work performed on the Kinzie Street Bridge conformed to specifications and did pass City inspection upon completion in 1991.
In the lawsuits that followed Great Lakes was initially found liable but was later cleared after it was revealed that the city was aware the tunnel was leaking before the flood and the city had also not properly maintained the tunnel.[6][7]
In addition the case went the United States Supreme Court in Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. - 513 U.S. 527 (1994) which ruled that since the work was being done by a vessel in navigable waters of the Chicago River, Admiralty law applied and Great Lakes liability was greatly limited.[8]
2008 Liberian freighter collision[edit]
In January 2008, a 117 ft. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company dredge in Newark Bay was struck by a 669-ft Liberian-flagged orange juice freighter named the Orange Sun. Newark Bay had to be closed for five hours by the U.S. Coast Guard until damages to the GLD&D dredge were mitigated. The dredge had begun to take on water and a diving crew was sent in order to make repairs.[9] In December 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a report that blamed the Orange Sun for the accident. The Orange Sun's master had not informed the captain or crew about the ship's tendency to deviate from its course.[10]
Jersey Shore[edit]
The company was hired to build dunes and berms along 22 miles of the Jersey Shore damaged by Hurricane Sandy.[11]
Operations[edit]
Great Lakes Dredge and Dock conducts most of its operations within the United States and 25% of its operations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. GLD&D dredging operations consist of deepening and maintaining waterways, shipping channels, and ports; creating and maintaining (re-nourishing) beaches; excavating new harbors; reclaiming land in the water or improving low-lying land areas; restoring aquatic and wetland habitats and excavating pipeline, cable and tunnel trenches.[3]
In 1990, GLD&D renewed its overseas efforts and created a foreign division. By 1993, GLD&D was awarded significant projects in the Middle East. Soon projects in Europe, Africa, Mexico and South America would begin as well. GLD&D also provided excavation and reclamation for the Oresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden.[3]
In 2003, GLD&D performed dredging of the Umm Qasr Port in Iraq. GLD&D also constructed a port in Hidd, Bahrain around the same time.[3] In June 2010, GLD&D under the Shaw Environmental and Infrastructure Group began constructing sand berms off the Louisiana coast to limit the amount of approaching oil in the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.[12]

In 1990, GLD&D renewed its overseas efforts and created a foreign division. By 1993, GLD&D was awarded significant projects in the Middle East. Soon projects in Europe, Africa, Mexico and South America would begin as well. GLD&D also provided excavation and reclamation for the Oresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden.[3]
In 2003, GLD&D performed dredging of the Umm Qasr Port in Iraq. GLD&D also constructed a port in Hidd, Bahrain around the same time.[3] In June 2010, GLD&D under the Shaw Environmental and Infrastructure Group began constructing sand berms off the Louisiana coast to limit the amount of approaching oil in the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.[12]

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

OUR HISTORY
 





OVER A CENTURY OF EXPERIENCE


Since its founding in 1890, GLDD has been highly invested in engineering excellence through innovative techniques, adaptability of fleet equipment, and extension of the company’s service arm into full-scale infrastructure and environmental remediation.
The company has operated on many notable projects around the globe—Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill cleanup, Diyar al Muharraq, Port Miami harbor deepening—while never failing to complete a project in its over 125-year history.


 
 The BeginningEarly YearsThe ExpansionRecent Years
THE BEGINNING


Founded in 1890, as the partnership of William A. Lydon & Fred C. Drews’, Lydon & Drews’ first project was the construction of an offshore tunnel to extend the water intake at Chicago Avenue to a new water crib farther from the shore. The company experienced tremendous expansion in the 1890s, moving from its Chicago base to open satellite operations in the major cities on the Great Lakes. Projects at the time included the shoreline structures for Chicago’s Columbian Expedition in 1892, as well as the foundations for what is currently Navy Pier.
In 1905, the company changed its name to Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company. The company’s fleet expanded to include thirteen dredges and ten tugboats. Projects involving dredging, pile-driving, construction of foundations, bridges, breakwaters and lighthouses were completed in Chicago and throughout the Great Lakes. By 1920, Great Lakes was operating in Albany, New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, and other east coast locations. Accordingly, an Atlantic Division office was established in the Whitehall Building in downtown Manhattan.












Between 1900 and 1950, the company completed a number of significant projects, including:

A massive water intake for U.S. Steel’s then new Gary (Indiana) works.
Construction of the Sabin Lock at Sault Ste. Marie.
Straightening a section of the South Branch of the Chicago River.
Shoreline reclamation in Chicago for the Adler Planetarium, Shedd Aquarium, Soldier Field, Northerly Island (built to house the 1933 World’s Fair, later the site of Meigs Field) and the Field Museum as well as landfill for Lincoln Park, Jackson Park, Grant Park and Chicago’s nine-mile shoreline.
Construction of the foundations and approaches to Chicago’s Michigan Avenue Bridge, the Outer Drive Bridge on Lake Shore Drive, and sections of the lower level of Wacker Drive.




EARLY YEARS








During World War II, Great Lakes was awarded the coveted Navy E-Flag for its work building the large MacArthur Lock at Sault Ste. Marie—a facility named by the Corps of Engineers as the most reliable lock on the Great Lakes.
After the war, the company participated in extensive oil-related dredging in the Gulf of Mexico, in addition to numerous bridge and other marine construction projects around the country. In the 1970s, the Corps of Engineers’ fleet was reduced to a size considered necessary for emergencies and national defense. A robust private dredging sector took its place. Great Lakes’ president at the time, John A. Downs, was instrumental in promoting legislation that ultimately mandated the reduction of the Corps fleet. At the same time, the company expanded its operations internationally, venturing into the Middle East, South America, and Africa. Also during this period, beach nourishment was added to the company’s operational repertoire.



THE EXPANSION








In 1986, the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (the so-called “Deep Ports” legislation) improved U.S. transportation infrastructure by deepening major U.S. ports—much of which was performed by the company. In 1990, following up on its successful project to create the harbor at Jebel Ali in Dubai, Great Lakes launched a renewed international marketing effort by establishing a dredging division in the Middle East.
In 1993, the overseas marketing program was awarded the reclamation and harbor infrastructure projects in Doha, Qatar, followed by other successful projects in Europe, Africa, Mexico, and South America. The company also performed excavation and reclamation for the construction of the Øresund Fixed Link—the bridge/island/tunnel system that joins Denmark and Sweden.



RECENT YEARS


In 2000, Great Lakes successfully completed a myriad of high-profile projects with work finishing up on such contracts as the Oresund Fixed Link in Denmark; Suez Canal in Egypt; and the expansion of two California terminals, Pier 400 in Los Angeles Harbor and Pier J in the Port of Long Beach.
Over the next five years, Great Lakes was the first contractor to go to work after the preliminary hostilities in Iraq, performing needed harbor maintenance work at the Port of Umm Qasr to enable the entry of humanitarian cargo. The company has also completed extensive dredging for the deepening of San Juan Harbor in Puerto Rico, the dredging of Umm Qasr Port in Iraq, and reclamation work at Khalifa bin Salman in Bahrain.











More recently, GLDD has constructed new land masses for the resort cities of Diyar al Muharraq and Durrat al Bahrain, among many other large-scale development projects in Bahrain. When the need for emergency dredging services arose in response to the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes was prominent among those answering the call.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Good news it does remove weeds.  Bad news is if the weeds are heavy, the weeds pull the cord and this gets tangled in the chains.  It is difficult to anchor the system especially in deeper water.

2. Alena on 6/6/2014, said:  



  
It is such a pleasure to swim enjoying the nice sandy bottom of the lake vs. prior to having the Lakemaid we had to swim in the weeds! The equipment is not difficult to install and once that is completed, we can forget it and just watch the efficiency of the Lakemaid.  I especially like the free standing unit and  not having it attached to the dock.  The equipment is not heavy for installation and also stores nice for the winter.

I am excited to write a review about Lake Restoration. In the past I have purchased the Lake Maid which I enjoyed thoroughly, also I have bought many supplies for my pond and my lake shore. They always seem to be very educated on their products and more than willing to help you with any questions you might have.  - Mark from St. Cloud, MN

4. Anonymous User on 5/30/2014, said:  



  
We were really excited to try this product. So... the unit twisted up  no matter what you did, making the cord cover way too short. It got blown in no matter how heavy you made the anchor. When it hit weeds, even with the chains shortened, it stopped turning (& if it's on a slope, the chains are either too long or too short). The finishing chains gouge deep channels, in our case merely moving the silt over a bit. The connections corroded after a couple of weeks, making it very difficult to get apart or together. We got the larger one- it was quite expensive & has been just sitting in our back yard for the last 2 years- we so wish we had not gone this route!!

Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company, LLC (GLDD) of Oak Brook, Illinois, protests the post-bid opening cancellation of invitation for bids (IFB) No. W9127S-12-B-0025, which was issued by the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, for dredging services. GLDD contends that the Corps did not have a compelling reason to cancel the solicitation and that, as the lowest responsive bidder, it should have been awarded the contract.
We deny the protest. 











 Decision  Matter of: Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company, LLC File: B-407502.2 Date: February 13, 2013 Paul R. Hurst, Esq., Steptoe & Johnson LLP, for the protester.S. DeAnn Lehigh, Esq., Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, for the agency.Andrew J. Stephens, Esq., and Jonathan L. Kang, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, GAO, participated in the preparation of the decision.DIGEST Protest challenging the agencys cancellation of an invitation for bids (IFB) is denied where the agency concerns regarding an ambiguity in the IFB provided a compelling basis for cancellation.DECISION Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company, LLC (GLDD) of Oak Brook, Illinois, protests the post-bid opening cancellation of invitation for bids (IFB) No. W9127S-12-B-0025, which was issued by the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, for dredging services. GLDD contends that the Corps did not have a compelling reason to cancel the solicitation and that, as the lowest responsive bidder, it should have been awarded the contract. We deny the protest. BACKGROUND The Corps issued the IFB on August 24, 2012, which sought bids for an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contract for dredging services, with a base period of one year, and one 1-year option. Agency Report (AR) at 1.[1] The dredging was to be performed, as required, at the following locations: between Navigation Miles 0 and 444.8 on the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation system; between Navigation Miles 10 and 255 on the White River; and in harbors at Rosedale and Greenville, Mississippi. IFB at 1. The IFB listed nine contract line item numbers (CLINs) for the base year and nine CLINs for the option year. Id. at 4-12. As relevant here, CLIN 0001 was for mobilization/demobilization services in the base year, and CLIN 1001 was for demobilization services for the option year. Id. at 4, 8. The IFB also incorporated the clause at Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) § 252.236-7004, which provided that the agency would pay 65 percent of the lump sum price for mobilization and demobilization upon completion of the mobilization work, and the remaining 35 percent upon completion of demobilization. Id. at 39. The Corps received bids from four firms: GLDD, 4H Construction, Inland Dredging Company, LLC, and Orion Marine Construction. AR, Tab 7, Bid Evaluation Documents, at 1. On September 24, the bids were opened, and on September 28, the Corps announced that 4H Construction was the apparent lowest bidder and would be awarded the contract. AR, Tab 2, CO Statement, at 2; AR, Tab 7, Bid Evaluation Documents. On October 3, GLDD filed a protest with our Office alleging that 4H Constructions bid was materially unbalanced based on its price for CLIN 0001 for mobilization/demobilization in the base year. Upon review, the Corps concluded that 4H Constructions bid was materially unbalanced, and therefore nonresponsive, as its CLIN 0001 price was significantly higher than all other bidders and the government estimate. AR at 1. After concluding that 4H Constructions bid was nonresponsive, the agency canceled the IFB and our Office dismissed GLDDs protest of the award to 4H Construction as academic. On November 5, GLDD filed a protest with our Office challenging the Corps decision to cancel the IFB, rather than awarding the contract to GLDD as the lowest responsive bidder. Protest at 1. On December 6, the Corps submitted its report on the protest; GLDD filed timely comments on the report on December 17. On January 8, 2013, while the protest was pending at our Office, the Corps issued a revised IFB for the dredging work. As relevant here, the January 8 IFB added a second option year. IFB (Jan. 8, 2013) at 9. More significantly, the January 8 IFB replaced CLIN 0001 for mobilization/demobilization in the base year with separate mobilization and demobilization CLINs for the base year, and added CLINs for demobilization in each of the option years.[2] Id. at 8-9. The January 8 IFB also deleted DFARS § 252.236-7004, which had provided for the 65/35 percent lump sum payments for mobilization and demobilization. The revised IFB explained that the contractor would be paid for demobilization through the demobilization CLIN for the appropriate year, e.g., through the base year CLIN if no options were exercised, or through the CLIN for the final option exercised. Id. at 54. GLDD subsequently argued that the issuance of the January 8 IFB demonstrated that the Corps lacked a compelling basis to cancel the August 24 IFB, for reasons relating to the evaluation quantities for the dredging work. Our Office requested that the Corps and the protester submit additional briefing regarding the January 8 IFB. In this briefing, the agency explained the basis for the revisions in the January 8 IFB. DISCUSSION GLDD argues that the Corps improperly canceled the IFB because the agency did not have a compelling reason for its action, as required under the FAR. In its response to the protest, the Corps identified several reasons why it believed that cancellation of the August 24 IFB was proper. As relevant here, the agency argues that the August 24 IFB was ambiguous with regard to the mobilization and demobilization CLINs, and that this defect could result in the government paying twice for demobilization services.[3] Agency Supp. Response (Jan. 15, 2013) at 2; Agency Response to GAO Interrogatories (Jan. 24, 2013) at 3. Because we conclude that the defects concerning the mobilization and demobilization CLINs provide a compelling basis to cancel the solicitation, we do not address the agencys other bases for cancellation. [4] When an agency issues an IFB and opens bids, award must be made to the bidder who submitted the lowest responsive bid, unless there if a compelling reason to reject all bids and cancel the invitation. Federal Acquisition Regulation § 14.404-1(a)(1). The standard for canceling an IFB after bids have been opened is different from the standard for canceling a request for proposals (RFP) after award; an agency need only demonstrate a reasonable basis to cancel an RFP after award. See Noelke GmbH, B-278324.2, Feb. 9, 1998, 98-1 CPD ¶ 46 at 3. This different standard applies because of the potential adverse impact on the competitive bidding system of cancelation after bid prices have been exposed at a public bid opening. United Contracting LLC, B-407417, Jan. 2, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶ ___ at 2. A compelling reason to cancel a solicitation after bid opening exists where material solicitation terms are ambiguous or in conflict. P.J. Dick, Inc. B-259166, B-260333, Mar. 6, 1995, 95-1 CPD ¶ 131 at 4. The Corps argues that the mobilization and demobilization CLINs in the August 24 IFB required revision because the solicitation was ambiguous as to how the successful contractor would be paid for these services. As discussed above, the August 24 IFB contained CLIN 0001 for mobilization/demobilization, and CLIN 1001 for demobilization. The August 24 IFB also incorporated the following DFARS clause, which specified how mobilization and demobilization costs would be paid: (a) The Government will pay all costs for the mobilization and demobilization of all of the Contractors plant and equipment at the contract lump sum price for this item. (1) Sixty-Five (65%) percent of the lump sum price upon completion of the contractors mobilization at the work site. (2) The remaining thirty five (35%) percent upon completion of demobilization. DFARS § 252.236-7004; IFB at 39. The August 24 IFB also provides: Demobilization will be paid at the completion of the base year if the option year is not exercised. If the option year is exercised, demobilization will be paid upon its completion. IFB at 53. In contrast, the revised January 8 IFB contained CLIN 0001 for mobilization and CLIN 0010 for demobilization in the base year, and CLINs 1001 and 2001 for demobilization in each option year; the January 8 IFB also did not incorporate DFARS § 252.236-7004. The Corps argues that the August 24 IFB CLINs created an ambiguity because, for similar dredging contracts, there is typically one mobilization at the beginning of contract performance, and one demobilization at either the end of the base year, or at the end of the option year, if the option is exercised. Agency Supp. Response (Jan. 15, 2013), at 2. The agency argues that under the August 24 IFB, the CLIN structure for mobilization and demobilization created the possibility that the agency would pay twice for a service provided only once. Agency Response to GAO Interrogatories (Jan. 24, 2013) at 3. We agree with the Corps that the August 24 IFB was ambiguous with regard to the price to be paid for mobilization and demobilization. Specifically, inclusion of CLIN 0001 for both mobilization and demobilization in the base year, as well as CLIN 1001 for demobilization in the option year, creates uncertainty as to whether the contractor would be paid once, or twice, for demobilization. In this regard, as discussed above, DFARS § 252.236-7004 provides that 65 percent of the lump sum for mobilization and demobilization will be paid upon completion of mobilization, and the remaining 35 percent of that lump sum amount will be paid upon completion of demobilization. As applied to the August 24 IFB CLINs, it is not clear whether lump sum means only the price for CLIN 0001 for mobilization/demobilization in the base year, or the sum of the prices for CLIN 0001 as well as CLIN 1001 for demobilization in the option year. For example, if the term lump is read to mean that the contractor will be paid the sum of both CLIN 0001 and 1001, and the agency does not exercise the option year, the agency would pay for demobilization twice--once for the portion of CLIN 0001 attributable to demobilization and once for demobilization under CLIN 1001. As another example, if the term lump sum is read to mean only CLIN 0001, then it is not clear how much the agency should pay for demobilization if it exercises the option year. Under DFARS § 252.236-7004(a)(2), the agency is obligated to pay [t]he remaining [35 percent]--however, it is unclear whether that amount should include only CLIN 1001, or that CLIN plus the remainder (35 percent) of CLIN 0001.[5] GLDD contends that the IFB was not ambiguous and would not result in the government paying twice for demobilization services. In this regard, the protester states that in its performance of prior contracts, it was the practice of the agency to pay 65 percent of the price for the base year mobilization/demobilization CLIN upon completion of mobilization, to exercise the option year, and then pay the full unit price for the demobilization CLIN in the option year. Protesters Supp. Comments (Jan. 28, 2013) at 4. Although the protester contends that the agency could potentially avoid any confusion or ambiguity concerning payment for mobilization and demobilization by following this prior practice, there is no guarantee that the contract here would be performed in the same manner. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the successful bidder under the IFB here would not dispute the method for calculating the method of payment under the contracts disputes clause, given the ambiguities discussed above. In sum, we conclude that the IFB terms governing the amount to be paid for demobilization are ambiguous and in conflict and, therefore, provide a compelling reason for cancelling the August 24 IFB. The protest is denied. Susan A. PolingGeneral Counsel[1] Citations to the IFB in this decision refer to the solicitation issued on August 24, 2012. As discussed below, the Corps issued a revised solicitation on January 8, 2013. Additionally, although not directly relevant here, the Corps initially issued the solicitation on May 23, 2012, as a total small business set-aside, and received two bids. Contracting Officer (CO) Statement ¶ 1. After bid-opening, the unsuccessful bidder, 4H Construction Corporation, filed a protest with the Small Business Administration (SBA), arguing the apparent low bidder, A&H Contractors, Inc., was not a small business. Id. ¶ 3; AR, Tab 4c, 4H Construction Protest Letter to SBA. On August 9, SBA sustained the protest. AR, Tab 4f, SBA Size Determination. On August 10, the agency canceled the initial IFB after determining that there was insufficient competition to make an award per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 6. CO Statement ¶ 5.[2] Another difference between the August 24 IFB and the January 8 IFB is that the January 8 IFB added a second option year.[3] The Corps identified other bases for cancelling the IFB, and GLDD challenged these bases. Because we conclude that the defects with the mobilization and demobilization CLINs provided a compelling basis to cancel the solicitation, we do not address the other issues.[4] As GLDD notes, the Corps did not cite the mobilization and demobilization CLINs as a compelling basis for cancelling the solicitation in its initial report on the protest. The agency first raised this argument in its response to the protesters January 10, 2013, filing concerning the January 8 IFB. Our Office has held that even if an agencys initial bases for cancelling an IFB are not compelling, cancellation is not objectionable if the agency subsequently identifies a compelling basis for the cancellation. Mid Atlantic Commcns, B-221277, Mar. 27, 1986, 86-1 CPD ¶ 294at 4.[5] Additionally, although not specifically argued by the Corps, it is also unclear how the agency should calculate the price for mobilization. DFARS § 252.236-7004(a)(2) states that the contractor should be paid a lump sum based on65 percent of the combined price for mobilization and demobilization. If the agency does not know whether it will exercise the option year, it is unclear whether the mobilization price should include CLINs 0001 and 1001, or only CLIN 0001.

		We deny the protest.

		BACKGROUND

		The procurement is part of a decades‑long joint project between the Corps and the State of New Jersey, Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), for hurricane and storm damage reduction on Absecon Island, an 8-mile long barrier island in Atlantic County, New Jersey, comprised of four coastal municipalities: Atlantic City, Ventnor City, Margate City, and the Borough of Longport. See Absecon Island Coastal Storm Risk Management, available at www.nap.usace. army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/AbseconIslandStormDamageReduction.aspx. The project consists of berm and dune beachfill to be constructed along the oceanfront of the four municipalities. Id. The Atlantic City and most of the Ventnor City beachfill was completed in June 2004. See id. Under a new project partnership agreement to complete the remaining beachfill, NJDEP is responsible for acquiring the necessary real estate interests, and the Corps is responsible for construction costs.  Agency Report (AR) at 1-2.

		On September 15, 2014, the Philadelphia District of the Corps issued the IFB seeking a contractor to construct the remaining stretch of beachfill in Margate, Longport, and the southern portion of Ventnor. IFB at 1; IFB § 01 11 00, Summary of Work, at 1. The solicitation incorporated Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.214-19, Contract Award-Sealed Bidding-Construction, which provides for award to the lowest-priced responsible bidder. IFB § 00 21 00-4. The IFB warned bidders that bids would not be opened unless the real estate issues had been resolved, and that there was no guarantee that the outstanding issues would be resolved or that a contract would be awarded. IFB at 3.

		On October 1, NJDEP filed administrative orders with the Atlantic County Clerk’s Office “taking” (i.e., seizing) perpetual easements and other property interests for specified oceanfront parcels in Margate in order to proceed with the project. See Margate v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, No. 14-cv-7303, at 5-8 (D.N.J. Jan. 15, 2015). Property interests over parcels in Longport were separately acquired through that borough’s exercise of the New Jersey Disaster Control Act, which grants municipal governing bodies the authority to seize property in order to restore or construct protective coastal barriers.[1] See Contracting Officer (CO) Statement at 2, citing N.J.S.A. App. A §§ 9-51.5--51.7.

		On October 14, NJDEP provided an “Authorization for Entry for Construction” to the Corps certifying that NJDEP had obtained sufficient title and real property interest over the required parcels in order for the Corps to begin construction. AR, Tab H, NJDEP Authorization for Entry for Constr., at 1. The authorization was executed by the administrator of NJDEP, as well as the assistant attorney general for NJDEP, who certified that NJDEP had the legal authority to grant the authorization. Id.

		Two firms, including GLDD, submitted bids in response to the IFB that were opened on October 28. CO Statement at 3. GLDD was the apparent low bidder. AR, Tab I, Bid Abstract, at 3.

		On November 24, hours before the Corps was to award the contract to GLDD, Margate City and two private oceanfront landowners sought, in U.S. District Court, a temporary restraining order (TRO) to enjoin the Corps and NJDEP from awarding any contract for the construction of sand dunes on Margate beaches. CO Statement at 3; see Margate, supra, at 2. Among other things, the plaintiffs argued that NJDEP’s taking of property interests by administrative order failed to comply with the condemnation proceedings required under New Jersey’s Eminent Domain Act, N.J.S.A. tit. 20, thereby denying the plaintiffs of their right to challenge the state’s determination that the taking was for a public use.[2] Margate, supra, at 9; CO Statement at 3.

		The federal district court granted the TRO on that same date (November 24), and the Corps immediately discontinued efforts to award the contract. CO Statement at 4. On December 4, following a court hearing on the TRO, the contracting officer requested that both bidders extend their bids for 60 days during the pendency of the court proceedings. Id. at 3; see AR, Tabs L-N, Requests for Bid Extension. GLDD only agreed to extend its bid for 30 days; the second bidder agreed to extend its bid for 60 days.[3] AR, Tabs N-O, Bidder Responses to Extension Requests.

		On January 15, 2015, the federal district court issued an opinion agreeing with Margate and the private landowners that NJDEP’s seizure of property interests, by administrative order, likely violated the state’s Eminent Domain Act. See Margate, supra, at 17. However, the court denied, without prejudice,[4] the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction because construction of the project was not imminent and NJDEP represented to the court that NJDEP would file formal condemnation proceedings for the parcels. Id. at 24-28.

		On February 13, in an unrelated case, the Superior Court in neighboring Ocean County ruled that New Jersey’s Disaster Control Act did not authorize the Township of Long Beach to acquire easements for shore protection unless the municipality also complied with the procedures required under the state’s Eminent Domain Act.[5] Minke Family Trust v. Long Beach, No. OCN-L-3033-14, at 1-2, 11 (N.J. Super. Ct. Feb. 13, 2015). As relevant here and as noted above, the Borough of Longport had exercised this same Disaster Control Act authority to seize the property interests needed to complete the Longport portion of the Absecon Island project.

		On February 24, the agency cancelled the IFB. The contracting officer informed the bidders that he had determined, pursuant to FAR § 14.404-1(c)(10), that it was in the public interest to cancel the solicitation, because the legal challenges to the real estate acquisitions for the project had not been resolved. See, e.g., AR, Tab V, IFB Cancellation Letter to GLDD. He advised the bidders that award of the contract under the pending litigation would pose a significant risk to the government. Id. This protest followed.

		DISCUSSION

		GLDD argues that the Corps lacks a compelling reason to cancel the IFB after bid opening, and maintains that the agency did not meaningfully consider delaying contract award. GLDD complains that its competitors will seek to undercut its low bid in any subsequent re‑procurement, and urges the Corps to reinstate the IFB and permit bidders to extend their bid acceptance periods pending resolution of the real estate issues.

		The Corps asserts that its inability to provide the required real estate interests, and the indeterminate amount of time that it will take NJDEP to acquire those interests through the more time consuming eminent domain process, provide compelling reasons to cancel the IFB.[6] Moreover, the Corps maintains that the project performance period will remain unknown for many months--likely impacting bid prices and the availability of other offerors to compete for the requirement--which also provide compelling reasons to cancel the solicitation.[7] AR at 9, citing, inter alia, Southwest Marine, Inc., B-229596, B-229598, Jan. 12, 1988, 88-1 CPD ¶ 22. The Corps maintains that when it issued the IFB, neither the Corps, nor NJDEP, expected the litigation discussed above, which effectively reversed NJDEP’s earlier authorization for construction.

		A contracting agency must have a compelling reason to cancel an IFB after bid opening due to the potential adverse impact on the competitive bidding system of resoliciting after bid prices have been exposed. FAR § 14.404-1(a)(1); HDL Research Lab, Inc., B‑254863.3, May 9, 1994, 94‑1 CPD ¶ 298 at 5. Contracting officials have broad discretion to determine whether a compelling reason to cancel exists, and our review is limited to considering the reasonableness of their decision. Chenega Mgmt., LLC, B‑290598, Aug. 8, 2002, 2002 CPD ¶ 143 at 2.

		We find the Corps’ decision to cancel the IFB reasonable under the circumstances described above. The Margate litigation, and the indeterminate delays that are likely to result from the required condemnation proceedings, provided compelling reasons for the Corps to cancel the solicitation. The Corps’ decision is also consistent with the IFB’s explicit (and emphatic) warning to potential bidders that there was no guarantee that outstanding real estate issues would be resolved or that a contract would be awarded. IFB at 3. Moreover, contrary to the protester’s assertion, the Corps did in fact consider postponing the award date and requested that bidders extend their bids for 60 days, as discussed above. Despite its arguments now, GLDD initially refused to extend its bid for 60 days, and agreed only to a 30-day extension, which it later extended to 60 days.

		While the protester apparently believes that the Corps should continue to seek an indefinite number of bid extensions, we believe that the agency acted reasonably here and was not required to do more. To the extent that GLDD asserts that the Corps did not consider the risks to bidders of cancelling the IFB without award, the agency states, and the protester does not dispute, that the decision to cancel the IFB was taken after substantial consultation with the project manager, real estate professionals, legal counsel, and others, who concluded that the litigation may negatively impact the progress of any awarded contract. We find no basis to disagree with the agency’s deliberations or ultimate decision to cancel the solicitation.

		The protest is denied.

[1] The remaining parcels in Ventnor are not directly at issue here.



[2] As explained in the court’s opinion, Margate had long opposed NJDEP’s storm prevention strategies (including its current joint project with the Corps to construct 13 foot high, 25 foot wide sand dunes), because Margate residents believed the local topography and the city’s system of bulkheads were sufficient to prevent catastrophic storm damage. Margate v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, No. 14-cv-7303, at 4-5 (D.N.J. Jan. 15, 2015).



[3] On January 19, GLDD extended its bid for an additional 30 days. AR, Tab P, GLDD Bid Extension No. 2, at 1-2.



[4] The court ordered the Corps to give 10-days prior notice in the event that the Corps prepared to proceed with construction, in order to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to seek reconsideration of the court’s denial of the preliminary injunction. Margate, supra, at 28.



[5] The Long Beach Island Project is also a joint storm damage reduction project between the Corps and NJDEP. See www.nap.usace.army.mil/Missions/ CivilWorks/LongBeachIslandStormDamageReduction.aspx.



[6] The Corps maintains that the earliest possible date by which NJDEP could acquire the necessary real estate interests through condemnation under the state’s Eminent Domain Act would be mid to late June 2015, but that there is a high likelihood that the time period would be substantially longer and indeterminate if further litigation arises in that regard. AR at 6; see, e.g., supra n.4 (court denying plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction without prejudice in order to permit plaintiffs to renew their motion prior to project construction).



[7] The IFB stated that the work must be completed by April 15, 2016. IFB § 00 73 00 SC-1.
