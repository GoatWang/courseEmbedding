Good Harbor was formed in 2003 by Neil Peplinski to implement his unique statistical asset allocation strategy.

In 2007, Neil joined with Paul Ingersoll, his former classmate at the University of Chicago, to further develop the Firm and its tactical approach.

Tactical Core
The underlying premise of the Good Harbor tactical model is that equity prices are driven by changes in investor risk premiums and that these premiums vary with the global business cycle. By gauging a combination of momentum measures, economic data and yield curve analysis, the model seeks to assess changes in risk premiums in order to participate in equities during rallies and move defensively to bonds when weaker market conditions are anticipated.

DISCLAIMERPerformance results presented are from April 30, 2003, the strategy's inception. Performance results are presented in US dollars and are net-of-max-fees and trading expenses and reflect the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. The applicable fee schedule is 2%. Actual fees may vary based on, among other factors, account size and custodial relationship. To the extent you are a non-fee paying investor, or your fees differ from the applicable schedule, your returns may differ from those presented.
Good Harbor Financial's reliance on the strategy and its judgments about the value and potential appreciation of the securities in which the strategy invests may prove to be incorrect. Overall market risk, including volatility, may affect the value of the individual instruments in which the strategy invests.  No current or prospective client should assume future performance of any specific investment strategy will be profitable or equal to past performance levels. All investment strategies have the potential for profit or loss.
The S&P 500 Total Return Index is the total return version of the S&P 500 Index which includes the effects of reinvested dividends. The S&P 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The investment strategy and types of securities held by the comparison indices may be substantially different from the investment strategy and the types of securities held by the strategy.

Investment Philosophy



Our philosophy is that disciplined and objective investment approaches generate enhanced risk-adjusted returns. When an investment strategy is expressed in model form, it can be researched and tested providing a rich data set for return and risk management analysis.
This philosophy drives strategy development. Our in-depth research establishes investment solutions with sound economic underpinnings. Through detailed analysis, we quantify and validate our strategies to identify stable, fiscal relationships. As a result, our investment solutions are designed to navigate both up and down markets.

VIDEO DISCLAIMERPast performance is no guarantee of future results. The opinions expressed in this article are those of Mr. Peplinski and are current through the date of the broadcast. Mr. Peplinski's views are subject to change at any time based on market and other current conditions, and no forecasts can be guaranteed. This material does not take into account any investor's particular investment objectives, strategies, tax status, or investment horizon. 
The Good Harbor Tactical Core strategies invest primarily in exchange traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds. Investors should consider the underlying funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other important information, should be read carefully before investing. The strategy is subject to management risk and an investor's return and principal value of investment may fluctuate, so that an investment, when liquidated, may be worth more or less than their original investment. ETFs trade like stocks and may trade for less than their net asset value. Good Harbor Financial, LLC's reliance on the strategy and its judgments about the value and potential appreciation of the securities in which the strategy invests may prove to be incorrect. Overall market risk, including volatility, may affect the value of the individual instruments in which the strategy invests.There will be brokerage commissions associated with buying and selling ETFs unless trading occurs in a fee-based account.
Performance results are presented in US dollars and are net-of-max-fees and trading expenses and reflect the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. The applicable fee schedule is 2%. Actual fees may vary based on, among other factors, account size and custodial relationship. To the extent you are a non-fee paying investor, or your fees differ from the applicable schedule, your returns may differ from those presented.Changes in investment strategies, contributions or withdrawals may cause the performance results of your portfolio to differ materially from the reported performance. Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will either be suitable or profitable for a client's investment portfolio. 
The S&P 500 Total Return Index is the total return version of the S&P 500 Index which includes the effects of reinvested dividends. The S&P 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries.The investment strategy and types of securities held by the comparison indices may be substantially different from the Good Harbor Tactical Core investment strategies. Historical performance results for market indices generally do not reflect the deduction of transaction and/or custodial charges or the deduction of an investment-management fee, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing historical performance results. Economic factors, market conditions and investment strategies will affect the performance of any portfolio and there are no assurances that it will match or outperform any particular benchmark.
Portfolios in the composite utilize levered index products. Leveraged ETFs are considered risky. The use of leverage strategies by a fund increases the risk to the fund and magnifies gains or losses on the investment. You could incur significant losses even if the long-term performance of the underlying index showed a gain. Most leveraged ETFs "reset" daily. Due to the effect of compounding, their performance over longer periods of time can differ significantly from the performance of their underlying index or benchmark during the same period of time.

Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will either be suitable or profitable for a client's investment portfolio. 
The S&P 500 Total Return Index is the total return version of the S&P 500 Index which includes the effects of reinvested dividends. The S&P 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries.The investment strategy and types of securities held by the comparison indices may be substantially different from the Good Harbor Tactical Core investment strategies. Historical performance results for market indices generally do not reflect the deduction of transaction and/or custodial charges or the deduction of an investment-management fee, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing historical performance results. Economic factors, market conditions and investment strategies will affect the performance of any portfolio and there are no assurances that it will match or outperform any particular benchmark.
Portfolios in the composite utilize levered index products. Leveraged ETFs are considered risky. The use of leverage strategies by a fund increases the risk to the fund and magnifies gains or losses on the investment. You could incur significant losses even if the long-term performance of the underlying index showed a gain. Most leveraged ETFs "reset" daily. Due to the effect of compounding, their performance over longer periods of time can differ significantly from the performance of their underlying index or benchmark during the same period of time.
