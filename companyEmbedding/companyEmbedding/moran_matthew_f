Context: Treadmills that unload runners via a differential air pressure bladder (DAP; e.g. AlterG Anti-Gravity Treadmill) are commonly used to reduce effective body weight in a clinical setting, however, the relationship between the level of unloading and tibial stress is currently unknown.

Objective: To determine the relationship between tibial impact acceleration and level of body weight (BW) unloading during running.

Design: Cross-sectional.

Setting: University motion-analysis laboratory.

Participants: 15 distance runners (9M, 6F; 20.4 ± 2.4 years; 60.1 ± 12.6 kg).

Interventions: None.

Main Outcome Measures: Peak tibial acceleration and peak-to-peak tibial acceleration was measured via a uniaxial accelerometer attached to the tibia during a 37-min continuous treadmill run that simulated reduced BW conditions via a DAP bladder. The trial began with a 10-min run at 100% BW followed by nine 3-min stages where BW was systematically reduced from 95% to 60% in 5% increments.

Results: There was no significant relationship between level of BW and either peak tibial acceleration or peak-to-peak tibial acceleration (p>.05). Both heart rate and step rate were significantly reduced with each 5% reduction in BW level (p<.01).

Conclusions: Although ground reaction forces are reduced when running in reduced BW conditions on a DAP treadmill, tibial shock magnitudes are unchanged as an alteration in spatiotemporal running mechanics (e.g. reduced step rate) may nullify the unloading effect.    https://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/17/Articles (peer-reviewed)Two-Legged Hopping in Autism Spectrum Disordershttps://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/24/Sensory processing deficits are common within autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Deficits have a heterogeneous dispersion across the spectrum and multimodal processing tasks are thought to magnify integration difficulties. Two-legged hopping in place in sync with an auditory cue (2.3, 3.0 Hz) was studied in a group of six individuals with expressive language impaired ASD (ELI-ASD) and an age-matched control group. Vertical ground reaction force data were collected and discrete Fourier transforms were utilized to determine dominant hopping cadence. Effective leg stiffness was computed through a mass-spring model representation. The ELI-ASD group were unsuccessful in matching their hopping cadence (2.21 ± 0.30 hops·s−1, 2.35 ± 0.41 hops·s−1) to either auditory cue with greater deviations at the 3.0 Hz cue. In contrast, the control group was able to match hopping cadence (2.35 ± 0.06 hops·s−1, 3.02 ± 0.10 hops·s−1) to either cue via an adjustment of effective leg stiffness. The ELI-ASD group demonstrated a varied response with an interquartile range (IQR) in excess of 0.5 hops·s−1 as compared to the control group with an IQR < 0.03 hops·s−1. Several sensorimotor mechanisms could explain the inability of participants with ELI-ASD to modulate motor output to match an external auditory cue. These results suggest that a multimodal gross motor task can (1) discriminate performance among a group of individuals with severe autism, and (2) could be a useful quantitative tool for evaluating motor performance in individuals with ASD individuals.https://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/24/Articles (peer-reviewed)https://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/23/https://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/23/Articles (peer-reviewed)Impact of Direction of Unloading Influence on Template Rate of Perceived Exertionhttps://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/22/It is suggested that exercisers engage in a process of teleoanticipation and create an exercise template based upon previous experience with the exercise task which guides their perceptions of the amount of effort required for task completion. The present study examined how altering workload intensity during a positive-pressure treadmill task may impact ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). In a counter-balanced design, 15 collegiate cross country runners (7 males, 8 females) performed two 25-min runs at a constant velocity while bodyweight (BW) was either increased from 60% to 100% (INC) or decreased from 100% to 60% (DEC) in 5 min increments. Oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate (HR), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were collected. RPE was recorded at the end of each stage, and energy expenditure (EE) was calculated with VO2 and RER data. There were no significant differences between direction of loading conditions for VO2, EE, HR, and RER (p > 0.05). Between-trial differences in RPE at 100%, 90%, 80% BW were statistically significant (p < 0.001) with higher RPEs observed during the INC trial. Differences in RPE observed between conditions cannot be explained by physiological mechanisms. These findings suggest that RPE is a multifaceted construct which can be impacted by subjectively based anticipatory factors such as exercise intensity.https://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/22/Articles (peer-reviewed)Gait Analysis of Teenagers and Young Adults Diagnosed with Autism & Severe Verbal Communication Disordershttps://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/21/Both movement differences and disorders are common within autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These differences have wide and heterogeneous variability among different ages and sub-groups all diagnosed with ASD. Gait was studied in a more homogeneously identified group of nine teenagers and young adults who scored as “severe” in both measures of verbal communication and overall rating of Autism on the Childhood Autism Rating Scales (CARS). The ASD individuals were compared to a group of typically developing university undergraduates of similar ages. All participants walked a distance of 6-meters across a GAITRite (GR) electronic walkway for six trials. The ASD and comparison groups differed widely on many spatiotemporal aspects of gait including: step and stride length, foot positioning, cadence, velocity, step time, gait cycle time, swing time, stance time, and single and double support time. Moreover, the two groups differed in the percentage of the total gait cycle in each of these phases. The qualitative rating of “Body Use” on the CARS also indicated severe levels of unusual body movement for all of the ASD participants. These findings demonstrate that older teens and young adults with “severe” forms of Verbal Communication Impairments and Autism differ widely in their gait from typically developing individuals. The differences found in the current investigation are far more pronounced compared to previous findings with younger and/or less severely involved individuals diagnosed with ASD as compared to typically developing controls. As such, these data may be a useful anchor-point in understanding the trajectory of development of gait specifically and motor functions generally.

.https://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/21/Articles (peer-reviewed)Influence of Midsole ‘Actuator Lugs’ on Running Economy in Trained Distance Runnershttps://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/20/Introduction: Previous investigations reported the influence of running shoe design on running economy (RE) and determined that both shoe weight and midsole properties (hardness, stiffness, comfort) can alter RE. External forefoot actuator lugs have been reported to provide enhanced energy return during shoe mechanical testing, but it was unclear if this design feature would provide any improvement of RE. The current investigation measured the effects of external forefoot actuator lugs on RE in 12 highly-trained male distance runners during four submaximal running velocities.

Methods: All runners voluntarily completed a maximal graded exercise treadmill protocol followed 5–7 days later by eight randomised 6 min submaximal level-grade treadmill runs with two randomised footwear conditions (WL = with lugs, WOL = without lugs). Oxygen consumption, heart rate (HR), rating of perceived effort (RPE), and sagittal plane high-speed video were collected. RE (metres run per millilitre O2 per kg of body mass), stance duration (ST), stride rate (SR), and foot strike (FS) were computed for each trial. Data were analysed with factorial repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Results: RE, averaged over all submaximal velocities, was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the WL condition (4.96 ± 0.12 m·ml−1·kg−1) as compared to the WOL condition (4.91 ± 0.10 m·ml−1·kg−1). Only one subject displayed a lower RE in the WL condition. No significant differences were found between HR (p > 0.05), ST (p > 0.05), or SR (p > 0.05) between footwear conditions, but running in the WL condition lowered RPE (p < 0.05).

Conclusions: The presence of external forefoot actuator lugs improved RE by ~1%, although the mechanisms explaining this improvement are not clear.https://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/20/Articles (peer-reviewed)https://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/19/https://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/19/Articles (peer-reviewed)Effects of Tensioning Errors in Split Transfers of Tibialis Anterior and Posterior Tendonshttps://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/18/Background: Split transfers of the tibialis anterior and posterior tendons are commonly performed to address hindfoot varus deformities in patients with cerebral palsy, stroke, or brain injury. Poor outcomes from these procedures are often attributed to a failure to tension the transferred tendon properly, but the mechanical effects of this aspect of the procedure have not been quantified, to our knowledge. The purpose of the present study was to use a cadaver model to examine changes in the actions of these muscles that occur when the tensions in the halves of the split tendon are intentionally balanced or unbalanced to varying degrees.

Methods: Tendon excursion was measured in seven cadaveric specimens before and after split tendon transfer with experimentally controlled tensions in the halves of the split tendon. The muscle moment arm, a quantitative indicator of the action of a muscle about a joint axis, was calculated as the derivative of tendon excursion with respect to the subtalar joint angle.

Results: The tibialis anterior had an eversion moment arm with the subtalar joint in a neutral position following surgery, but the tibialis posterior had virtually no action in the neutral position. Following the split transfers with ideally balanced tension, subtalar joint rotations of >5° strongly influenced the moment arm of the tibialis posterior (p < 0.0002), indicating that its action depends on the position of the hindfoot. The moment arm of the tibialis anterior, however, was influenced only by rotations of ≥20° (p > 0.1741 for each angle pair comparison of

Conclusions: These results suggest that it is possible for a split tendon transfer to be successful over a large range of tensionings. Split transfer of the tibialis posterior tendon produced the desired mechanical outcome in that the tibialis posterior had an eversion moment arm when the foot was inverted and an inversion moment arm when the foot was everted. Split transfer of the tibialis anterior to the cuboid, however, produced a muscle that consistently functioned as an everter regardless of the position of the hindfoot.

Clinical Relevance: Residual varus and overcorrection following a split tendon transfer are often attributed to technical errors in balancing the tension between the medial and lateral tendon halves. The findings of the present study, however, suggest that such surgical failures are likely caused by only the largest of imbalances in tendon tension.https://works.bepress.com/matthew_moran/18/Articles (peer-reviewed)
