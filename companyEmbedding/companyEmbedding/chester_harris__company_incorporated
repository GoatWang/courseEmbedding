LLCs also provide flexibility in management and offer the benefit of pass-through taxation which means that the profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners, who report them on their personal tax returns. Pass-through taxation is among the reasons why LLCs are significantly easier to run compared to a corporation.
                Why choose an LLCConsider forming an LLC if you are fearful of personal risks to lawsuits arising from your business. For example, if you decide to open a storefront business that deals directly with the public, you may fret that your commercial liability insurance won’t fully cover your personal assets from potential slip-and-fall lawsuits or claims by your vendors for unpaid debts. Running your business as an LLC may ease your mind because it instantly offers you an additional layer of security against these and other possible claims against your business.

Choosing a StateHow to Select a State for IncorporationWhy Incorporate in Delaware or Nevada?S CorpThe S corporation business entity type is a corporation that comes with a special advantage: it has the limited liability of a corporation, but without the "double taxation" of income passed through to the shareholders. Prior to the acceptance of the LLC, the S corporation was the best vehicle to shield the owners while avoiding double taxation. The "S corporation advantage" allows a business owner to use the business losses—such as those incurred during the startup phase—on their personal returns as deductions. S corporations can also provide savings for their owners on self-employment or Social Security/Medicare taxes along with the FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) tax.
                Why choose an S corporation?An S corporation allows the owners to offset non-business income with losses from the business, unlike a C corporation which is a completely separate tax entity. When compared to an LLC, the S corporation enables an owner to characterize a portion of income as “dividend,” rather than “earnings” that are subject to employment taxes.

Choosing a StateHow to Select a State for IncorporationWhy Incorporate in Delaware or Nevada?C CorpC corporations are the most common type of corporation. They offer more flexibility than S corporations relative to the number of owners (shareholders) they can have and who can be an owner. Because of a pronounced ability to deduct employee benefits, C corporations are often preferred by developing businesses.
                Why choose an C corporation?C corporations offer more flexibility than S corporations when it comes to the number of owners (shareholders) they can have as well as who can be an owner. Plus, the owners can hold different types of stock interests (such as preferred versus common stock.) This is one reason why venture capitalists choose C corporations when they offer funding to a business. Investors are drawn with the prospect of dividends if the corporation makes a profit. A C corporation can also retain and accumulate earnings (within reasonable limits) from year to year.

Choosing a StateHow to Select a State for IncorporationWhy Incorporate in Delaware or Nevada?Non-ProfitA nonprofit corporation is one that is formed for purposes other than making a profit. Nonprofit organizations come in many forms. Examples include churches, soup kitchens and hospitals. Forming a nonprofit corporation helps you avoid personal liability for the debts of your organization. The principal advantage to nonprofit status for an organization is that it will be qualified to receive both private and public grants.
                Why form a non-profit?While incorporating your not-for-profit venture is not a requirement, it lends more credibility to your organization. Also, in order to become tax-exempt, you must incorporate and also file Form 1023 with the Internal Revenue Service. A few states require a separate file for state tax-exempt status as well.

What does it mean to incorporate?Incorporating a business means turning your sole proprietorship or general partnership into a company formally recognized by your state of incorporation. When a company incorporates, it becomes its own legal business structure set apart from the individuals who founded the business. Through incorporation, the company's owner or owners create a separate legal entity to transact business. This new business entity corporation or limited liability company (LLC) transforms the way the business is seen through the eyes of the law and often has more credibility with potential customers, vendors and employees.
How does incorporation work?Wondering how to incorporate a business as a C corporation or S corporation or how to form an LLC? Here are some of the steps included in the process:Determine where you want to incorporate.Decide which business type is best for your business and goals. Consult with an attorney or accountant. Determine who the directors of the corporation or who the members/managers of the LLC will be.Select a registered agent. Your registered agent must be listed on your Articles of Incorporation or Articles of Organization. The registered agent is appointed by you to receive important legal and tax documents on behalf of your business and forward them to you. BizFilings includes this service in all incorporation packages. Prepare and file the Articles of Incorporation or Articles of Organization per instructions from the Secretary of State's office. BizFilings handles this step for you, allowing you to concentrate on running your business. Why is incorporating a business important?The primary benefit to business incorporation is limited liability. When you own a small business, you will invest a lot of money into not only getting it launched, but in keeping it running smoothly as well. As the owner you are responsible for any debts and losses your business may accumulate along the way. However, when you incorporate, you are typically only held responsible for the amount of money you personally invest. Your personal assets typically cannot be used to satisfy the debts and liabilities of your business.View our Benefits of Incorporation or Benefits of Creating an LLC article to learn more about this and other benefits of incorporating a business.For a comparison between multiple incorporation types view our article Which Business Type is Right for Me?

Corporation or LLC?


Published on Apr 1, 2010

 Summary
Read 'Corporation or LLC?' at 'Time to Start Up,' the small business blog by BizFilings.
Perhaps the most common advice a new small business owner hears is to incorporate. There are advantages as well as complications. But even if you decide to go ahead with incorporation, that's only the first of many choices you'll need to make. The next step is deciding whether to form a corporation or LLC.

The two are similar in many ways. Both are legally a bit like individuals. It's as if you've given birth – suddenly there's this new entity with rights of its own. Like that new baby, the new entity is NOT equivalent to you, and you'll get yourself in hot water if you pretend otherwise. Even if you are the only employee, writing a check for Billy's braces out of the company account is just like writing it out of your next door neighbor's checkbook.

So long as you are in compliance with state law, both types offer full limited liability to all of the owners of the business in every state. But neither a corporation nor an LLC will protect you in the event of your own malpractice or malfeasance. In both cases, you'll want business insurance to protect yourself.

Neither will take on your own personal debts—nice try—but in most states and industries, both will protect your personal assets in cases such as legal malfeasance by an employee.

So if they're similar in all those ways, how are they different? Most of it comes down to the way they're treated at tax time.

An LLC is a pass-through type of business. Profits and losses of the organization go straight through to the owners. Business income equals personal income, so the owner pays the tax on his or her personal return, and it's taxed at the individual rate.

Corporations are separate businesses entities with profits and losses taxable to themselves, not to the owners. As a result, corporations are taxed at the corporate rate.

LLCs are generally simpler in structure and in reporting requirements, but in some circumstances, proprietors can earn a substantially increased tax bill through the addition of the self-employment tax, currently at a painful 15.3 percent.

In some situations, corporations can bring their own tax headaches. As mentioned above, the corporation is taxed on its profits, but the owner is also taxed on any dividends and salary from the company. It's a double tax, and it can seriously cut into the real dollars earned in the end.

This is the beginning, not the end, of a branching tree of decisions. Your attorney or tax accountant can help you find the right path to making your entrepreneurial dream a reality.

Incorporation Wizard Tool: Decide on a Type of CorporationWhich business type might be right for you?
        Answer questions across all 6 categories for best results.Start Over


BasicsFundingIndustryIncomeTaxesFuture PlansResults
1. BasicsHow many owners will your company have?One
Two to 100
Over 100
Why is this important?The partnership business types must have 2 or more owners, and S corporations cannot have more than 100 owners. Answering "One" would eliminate LP or LLP, while answering "Over 100" would eliminate S corporation. Additionally, the number of owners an LLC has dictates whether it is treated like a sole proprietorship or a partnership for tax purposes.
                                                                    Will any of the following be owners of your company?Corporations and/or limited liability companies
Non-US citizens/residents
Trusts
None of the above
Why is this important?For certain business types, such as sole proprietorship and S corporation, owners must be individuals. With S corporations, owners must also be US citizens/residents. An answer other than "None of the above" would eliminate S corporation.Next Section

2. FundingHow will you finance your business? (select all that apply)My own capital
Only the owners will contribute capital
Loans from friends/family
Bank/SBA loan
Outside investors (sell shares/ownership interest)
Venture capital
Why is this important?Some lenders/investors prefer that companies they fund be a certain business type. Banks often require a business to be formalized (incorporated) and venture capitalist tend to lend mostly to C corporations.Next Section
Previous Section
Skip to Results


3. IndustryIs your business industry vulnerable to lawsuits?Yes
No
Don't know
Why is this important?Certain industries are more prone to lawsuits than others. For example, a general contractor in the construction industry is at greater risk for a lawsuit than a graphic designer.Does your industry require a state license? (such as a doctor, attorney, accountant, architect, etc.)Yes
No
Don't know
Why is this important?Most states require that businesses being organized to provide professional services form as limited liability partnerships, professional corporations or professional limited liability companies. Answering "Yes" to this question eliminates LP as an option.Will the primary purpose of your business be to own
                    real estate for investment?Yes
No
Why is this important?Investment property owners often choose a formal business structure for each property. Certain business types, such as the LLC, are typically the leading choice for realty investors.Next Section

4. IncomeWhat kind of income do you expect your business to
                        earn?
                        (select all that apply)Losses for the first two years
My business will be profitable
Profits will stay inside the business
Don't know
Why is this important?Tax treatment of business income can be a leading factor in selecting a business type. Estimating your company's revenue/profitability can help in this choice.  To further discuss the tax implication a certain entity type will have, you may wish to contact your accountant.Do any of the following apply to your business situation?
                            (select all that apply)The owner(s) have high personal income and may be at risk for the alternative minimum tax
You prefer to have a tax year end-date that is not December 31
You need an accountable plan for owner substantiated travel and entertainment expenses
None of the above
Why is this important?Owners' personal situations can also influence the choice of business type. The situations outlined in this question tend to favor the C corporation. Indicating that you prefer to have a tax year end-date that is not December 31 will eliminate LP and LLP from consideration, as those entity types report taxes based on a calendar year ending December 31.Next Section

5. TaxesDo you want pass-through taxation?
                                (No income paid at the business level, profits/losses reported on owners' personal tax return and any tax due on business income paid at the individual level)Yes
No
Don't know
Why is this important?Pass-through taxation creates a situation where the business entity is not taxed. An answer of "Yes" to this question would eliminate C corp as an option, as taxes do exist at the entity level for C corporations.Do you want to minimize self-employment taxes?Yes
No
Don't know
Why is this important?While a good topic to discuss with an accountant or tax advisor, corporations may offer more favorable treatment of self-employment taxes.Which employee benefits would you like to offer?
                                    (select all that apply)Flexible spending account(s)
Company-paid medical insurance
A qualified retirement plan
None of the above
Why is this important?The employee/fringe benefits the company offers may have tax benefits, and C corporations tend to incur the most benefits. It’s always good to discuss your particular situation with an account or tax advisor.Next Section

6. Future PlansDo you want to minimize ongoing recordkeeping requirements?Yes
No
Maybe
Why is this important?Corporations are required to follow multiple, ongoing "formalities," such a holding and properly documenting annual meetings of directors and shareholders, in order to maintain the limited liability protection provided to owners. Other business types do not face the same stringent recordkeeping requirements.What are your long-term business goals? (select all that apply)I want to sell my business for a profit
I want to keep my business in my family
I want my business to be publicly traded
If something happens to me or any owner, I want my business to continue to exist
Don't know
Why is this important?While not always a consideration when business owners are starting a business, your exit strategy or desired outcome for your business can influence your choice of business type. Wanting to sell your business for a profit would eliminate the partnership options. Wanting to be publicly traded would require formation as a C corp.Next Section

It seems we couldn't find a good fit.Find out why
It seems we wouldn't find a good fitAs our Incorporation Wizard indicates, there are many factors to consider when deciding which entity type will be the best fit for your situation. The answers that you have provided resulted in all entity types being eliminated from consideration. Of course, this does not mean that these entity types simply can't be considered. In fact, any one of them could still be perfectly appropriate, but may require a slight change of plans. For example, altering your tax year end-date or your feeling on being publicly traded may be all it would take to make one or more of these entities a viable option.Another resource to help determine the appropriate path for your business is our business type comparison guide. This may help you discover which selection best meets your needs. Another alternative is to call one of our Incorporation Specialists and speak with them about how you intend to use your company, what your short and long term goals are, and how the answers you gave impacted the results produced by our Incorporation Wizard.Please remember that the Incorporation Wizard and other suggested resources are not meant to be a substitute for the advice you could receive from a legal professional.Compare Incorporation Options

LLCs also provide flexibility in management and offer the benefit of pass-through taxation which means that the profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners, who report them on their personal tax returns. Pass-through taxation is among the reasons why LLCs are significantly easier to run compared to a corporation.
                Why choose an LLCConsider forming an LLC if you are fearful of personal risks to lawsuits arising from your business. For example, if you decide to open a storefront business that deals directly with the public, you may fret that your commercial liability insurance won’t fully cover your personal assets from potential slip-and-fall lawsuits or claims by your vendors for unpaid debts. Running your business as an LLC may ease your mind because it instantly offers you an additional layer of security against these and other possible claims against your business.

Choosing a StateHow to Select a State for IncorporationWhy Incorporate in Delaware or Nevada?S CorpThe S corporation business entity type is a corporation that comes with a special advantage: it has the limited liability of a corporation, but without the "double taxation" of income passed through to the shareholders. Prior to the acceptance of the LLC, the S corporation was the best vehicle to shield the owners while avoiding double taxation. The "S corporation advantage" allows a business owner to use the business losses—such as those incurred during the startup phase—on their personal returns as deductions. S corporations can also provide savings for their owners on self-employment or Social Security/Medicare taxes along with the FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) tax.
                Why choose an S corporation?An S corporation allows the owners to offset non-business income with losses from the business, unlike a C corporation which is a completely separate tax entity. When compared to an LLC, the S corporation enables an owner to characterize a portion of income as “dividend,” rather than “earnings” that are subject to employment taxes.

Choosing a StateHow to Select a State for IncorporationWhy Incorporate in Delaware or Nevada?C CorpC corporations are the most common type of corporation. They offer more flexibility than S corporations relative to the number of owners (shareholders) they can have and who can be an owner. Because of a pronounced ability to deduct employee benefits, C corporations are often preferred by developing businesses.
                Why choose an C corporation?C corporations offer more flexibility than S corporations when it comes to the number of owners (shareholders) they can have as well as who can be an owner. Plus, the owners can hold different types of stock interests (such as preferred versus common stock.) This is one reason why venture capitalists choose C corporations when they offer funding to a business. Investors are drawn with the prospect of dividends if the corporation makes a profit. A C corporation can also retain and accumulate earnings (within reasonable limits) from year to year.

Choosing a StateHow to Select a State for IncorporationWhy Incorporate in Delaware or Nevada?Non-ProfitA nonprofit corporation is one that is formed for purposes other than making a profit. Nonprofit organizations come in many forms. Examples include churches, soup kitchens and hospitals. Forming a nonprofit corporation helps you avoid personal liability for the debts of your organization. The principal advantage to nonprofit status for an organization is that it will be qualified to receive both private and public grants.
                Why form a non-profit?While incorporating your not-for-profit venture is not a requirement, it lends more credibility to your organization. Also, in order to become tax-exempt, you must incorporate and also file Form 1023 with the Internal Revenue Service. A few states require a separate file for state tax-exempt status as well.

What does it mean to incorporate?Incorporating a business means turning your sole proprietorship or general partnership into a company formally recognized by your state of incorporation. When a company incorporates, it becomes its own legal business structure set apart from the individuals who founded the business. Through incorporation, the company's owner or owners create a separate legal entity to transact business. This new business entity corporation or limited liability company (LLC) transforms the way the business is seen through the eyes of the law and often has more credibility with potential customers, vendors and employees.
How does incorporation work?Wondering how to incorporate a business as a C corporation or S corporation or how to form an LLC? Here are some of the steps included in the process:Determine where you want to incorporate.Decide which business type is best for your business and goals. Consult with an attorney or accountant. Determine who the directors of the corporation or who the members/managers of the LLC will be.Select a registered agent. Your registered agent must be listed on your Articles of Incorporation or Articles of Organization. The registered agent is appointed by you to receive important legal and tax documents on behalf of your business and forward them to you. BizFilings includes this service in all incorporation packages. Prepare and file the Articles of Incorporation or Articles of Organization per instructions from the Secretary of State's office. BizFilings handles this step for you, allowing you to concentrate on running your business. Why is incorporating a business important?The primary benefit to business incorporation is limited liability. When you own a small business, you will invest a lot of money into not only getting it launched, but in keeping it running smoothly as well. As the owner you are responsible for any debts and losses your business may accumulate along the way. However, when you incorporate, you are typically only held responsible for the amount of money you personally invest. Your personal assets typically cannot be used to satisfy the debts and liabilities of your business.View our Benefits of Incorporation or Benefits of Creating an LLC article to learn more about this and other benefits of incorporating a business.For a comparison between multiple incorporation types view our article Which Business Type is Right for Me?

Corporation or LLC?


Published on Apr 1, 2010

 Summary
Read 'Corporation or LLC?' at 'Time to Start Up,' the small business blog by BizFilings.
Perhaps the most common advice a new small business owner hears is to incorporate. There are advantages as well as complications. But even if you decide to go ahead with incorporation, that's only the first of many choices you'll need to make. The next step is deciding whether to form a corporation or LLC.

The two are similar in many ways. Both are legally a bit like individuals. It's as if you've given birth – suddenly there's this new entity with rights of its own. Like that new baby, the new entity is NOT equivalent to you, and you'll get yourself in hot water if you pretend otherwise. Even if you are the only employee, writing a check for Billy's braces out of the company account is just like writing it out of your next door neighbor's checkbook.

So long as you are in compliance with state law, both types offer full limited liability to all of the owners of the business in every state. But neither a corporation nor an LLC will protect you in the event of your own malpractice or malfeasance. In both cases, you'll want business insurance to protect yourself.

Neither will take on your own personal debts—nice try—but in most states and industries, both will protect your personal assets in cases such as legal malfeasance by an employee.

So if they're similar in all those ways, how are they different? Most of it comes down to the way they're treated at tax time.

An LLC is a pass-through type of business. Profits and losses of the organization go straight through to the owners. Business income equals personal income, so the owner pays the tax on his or her personal return, and it's taxed at the individual rate.

Corporations are separate businesses entities with profits and losses taxable to themselves, not to the owners. As a result, corporations are taxed at the corporate rate.

LLCs are generally simpler in structure and in reporting requirements, but in some circumstances, proprietors can earn a substantially increased tax bill through the addition of the self-employment tax, currently at a painful 15.3 percent.

In some situations, corporations can bring their own tax headaches. As mentioned above, the corporation is taxed on its profits, but the owner is also taxed on any dividends and salary from the company. It's a double tax, and it can seriously cut into the real dollars earned in the end.

This is the beginning, not the end, of a branching tree of decisions. Your attorney or tax accountant can help you find the right path to making your entrepreneurial dream a reality.

Incorporation Wizard Tool: Decide on a Type of CorporationWhich business type might be right for you?
        Answer questions across all 6 categories for best results.Start Over


BasicsFundingIndustryIncomeTaxesFuture PlansResults
1. BasicsHow many owners will your company have?One
Two to 100
Over 100
Why is this important?The partnership business types must have 2 or more owners, and S corporations cannot have more than 100 owners. Answering "One" would eliminate LP or LLP, while answering "Over 100" would eliminate S corporation. Additionally, the number of owners an LLC has dictates whether it is treated like a sole proprietorship or a partnership for tax purposes.
                                                                    Will any of the following be owners of your company?Corporations and/or limited liability companies
Non-US citizens/residents
Trusts
None of the above
Why is this important?For certain business types, such as sole proprietorship and S corporation, owners must be individuals. With S corporations, owners must also be US citizens/residents. An answer other than "None of the above" would eliminate S corporation.Next Section
Skip to Results


2. FundingHow will you finance your business? (select all that apply)My own capital
Only the owners will contribute capital
Loans from friends/family
Bank/SBA loan
Outside investors (sell shares/ownership interest)
Venture capital
Why is this important?Some lenders/investors prefer that companies they fund be a certain business type. Banks often require a business to be formalized (incorporated) and venture capitalist tend to lend mostly to C corporations.Next Section
Previous Section
Skip to Results


3. IndustryIs your business industry vulnerable to lawsuits?Yes
No
Don't know
Why is this important?Certain industries are more prone to lawsuits than others. For example, a general contractor in the construction industry is at greater risk for a lawsuit than a graphic designer.Does your industry require a state license? (such as a doctor, attorney, accountant, architect, etc.)Yes
No
Don't know
Why is this important?Most states require that businesses being organized to provide professional services form as limited liability partnerships, professional corporations or professional limited liability companies. Answering "Yes" to this question eliminates LP as an option.Will the primary purpose of your business be to own
                    real estate for investment?Yes
No
Why is this important?Investment property owners often choose a formal business structure for each property. Certain business types, such as the LLC, are typically the leading choice for realty investors.Next Section
Previous Section
Skip to Results


4. IncomeWhat kind of income do you expect your business to
                        earn?
                        (select all that apply)Losses for the first two years
My business will be profitable
Profits will stay inside the business
Don't know
Why is this important?Tax treatment of business income can be a leading factor in selecting a business type. Estimating your company's revenue/profitability can help in this choice.  To further discuss the tax implication a certain entity type will have, you may wish to contact your accountant.Do any of the following apply to your business situation?
                            (select all that apply)The owner(s) have high personal income and may be at risk for the alternative minimum tax
You prefer to have a tax year end-date that is not December 31
You need an accountable plan for owner substantiated travel and entertainment expenses
None of the above
Why is this important?Owners' personal situations can also influence the choice of business type. The situations outlined in this question tend to favor the C corporation. Indicating that you prefer to have a tax year end-date that is not December 31 will eliminate LP and LLP from consideration, as those entity types report taxes based on a calendar year ending December 31.Next Section
Previous Section
Skip to Results


5. TaxesDo you want pass-through taxation?
                                (No income paid at the business level, profits/losses reported on owners' personal tax return and any tax due on business income paid at the individual level)Yes
No
Don't know
Why is this important?Pass-through taxation creates a situation where the business entity is not taxed. An answer of "Yes" to this question would eliminate C corp as an option, as taxes do exist at the entity level for C corporations.Do you want to minimize self-employment taxes?Yes
No
Don't know
Why is this important?While a good topic to discuss with an accountant or tax advisor, corporations may offer more favorable treatment of self-employment taxes.Which employee benefits would you like to offer?
                                    (select all that apply)Flexible spending account(s)
Company-paid medical insurance
A qualified retirement plan
None of the above
Why is this important?The employee/fringe benefits the company offers may have tax benefits, and C corporations tend to incur the most benefits. It’s always good to discuss your particular situation with an account or tax advisor.Next Section
Previous Section
Skip to Results


6. Future PlansDo you want to minimize ongoing recordkeeping requirements?Yes
No
Maybe
Why is this important?Corporations are required to follow multiple, ongoing "formalities," such a holding and properly documenting annual meetings of directors and shareholders, in order to maintain the limited liability protection provided to owners. Other business types do not face the same stringent recordkeeping requirements.What are your long-term business goals? (select all that apply)I want to sell my business for a profit
I want to keep my business in my family
I want my business to be publicly traded
If something happens to me or any owner, I want my business to continue to exist
Don't know
Why is this important?While not always a consideration when business owners are starting a business, your exit strategy or desired outcome for your business can influence your choice of business type. Wanting to sell your business for a profit would eliminate the partnership options. Wanting to be publicly traded would require formation as a C corp.Next Section

It seems we couldn't find a good fit.Find out why
It seems we wouldn't find a good fitAs our Incorporation Wizard indicates, there are many factors to consider when deciding which entity type will be the best fit for your situation. The answers that you have provided resulted in all entity types being eliminated from consideration. Of course, this does not mean that these entity types simply can't be considered. In fact, any one of them could still be perfectly appropriate, but may require a slight change of plans. For example, altering your tax year end-date or your feeling on being publicly traded may be all it would take to make one or more of these entities a viable option.Another resource to help determine the appropriate path for your business is our business type comparison guide. This may help you discover which selection best meets your needs. Another alternative is to call one of our Incorporation Specialists and speak with them about how you intend to use your company, what your short and long term goals are, and how the answers you gave impacted the results produced by our Incorporation Wizard.Please remember that the Incorporation Wizard and other suggested resources are not meant to be a substitute for the advice you could receive from a legal professional.Compare Incorporation Options
