Wehave two employees, and we have not paid our officers any cash compensation
and have no plans to pay them any cash compensation. Staff salaries budget
allocated above is for the post-offering management hire.


Considering that the Company is currently at a very early stage of its
development, having neither operations nor revenues at the moment, it is
noncompetitive in relation to our potential competitors. We expect this to
change once and if we reach optimum operations level and begin generating
clients and revenues. We’ve identified 10 firms in the Russian Federation, 23 in
USA and 17 businesses in China who we may call competitors.

Our principle method of competition will be:

. Having highly qualified personnel.

. Offering lower prices

. Providing quality service with personal manager and round the clock 
  assistance.

. Generating positive feedback from customers.

. Having favorable terms of payment

Business tourism markets in the world are developing promptly. Based on the
evaluation of WorldTravel & Tourism Council - WTTC it is possible to predict
growth up to 2020 of $ 1.589 trillion, which is an annual growth of 4.3%.

According to data gathered by Global Business Travel Association – GBTA, as of
2014 the world leader of the business tourism market is the USA, however in
2016China may overcome it, with a business tourism market in excess of $ 309
billion. WTTC predicts that the Russian market of business travels in 2020 will
achieve $ 18.4 billion at an annual growth of 5.9 %. The volume of market of
private travel in 2010 that was $ 50.5 billion. The forecast for 2020 is $ 122.8
billion at the annual growth of 4.3 %. According to data from the Association of
Business Tourism of Russia in 2012, the volume of the business travel market in
Russia was RUB 440 billion, and in RUB 471 billion ($ 13.7 billion) in 2013.

Therefore, our concentrated focus on the fast-growing markets of Russia and
China may give us the advantage over the largest market participants – Carlson
Wagonlit Travel and American Express that do not offer services oriented only to
the certain growing market but offer their variety of services to companies from
around the world, which makes them, perhaps, too spread out and less
concentrated.


Company Description
Our primary business will be destination management and event management 
services initially in the Russian Federation, but with plans at a later stage to
spread our business to America and China. We will aim to provide a full range of
services in the field of Meeting, Incentive, Conference, and


 Exhibition tourism 
in Russia for corporate customers from United States, China and Russia. We plan
to create a variety of events for domestic and foreign companies, including; 
industry conferences and business meetings, dealer conferences for producers,
motivational and incentive arrangements for key employees, and organize
participation in exhibitions and forums.

ARMY CAREER EXPLORER
Discover Your Future
Are you curious about what jobs may fit your qualifications? Want to find out before you talk to a recruiter? Use the Army Career Explorer to browse hundreds of Army jobs. The information you enter into the Army Career Explorer will remain private until you choose to release it to a recruiter.








    	            
    	                How It Works
This tool matches you interests with jobs based on your ASVAB score and other factors. It can show you positions available in both the Army and the Army Reserve. Follow these steps to use the Army Career Explorer:

 
 





Step 1:
Create a My GoArmy Account. You will receive access to the Army Career Explorer, the discussion board, and other applications. If you have a valid email address, you can set up an account in just a few minutes.


 
 





Step 2:
Once your My GoArmy account is verified, you will be ready to start the job search process. You will be asked basic information about yourself. The job search tool can pull your ASVAB score if you have one. If you have not taken the ASVAB, you can submit your SAT/ACT scores. You can also take an ASVAB pre-test with this tool.

 
 





Step 3:
Search for jobs—you can compare jobs, add to your job list, and prioritize jobs. Jobs are shown based on availability, ASVAB score, educational requirements among other prerequisites. 

You are just exploring options, but you may also transfer this information into the APPLY ONLINE application.
