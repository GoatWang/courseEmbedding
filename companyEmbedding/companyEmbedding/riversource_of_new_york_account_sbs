Life Insurance




Protect tomorrow's possibilities today
Life insurance helps provide financial security to your family or others important you you and can help you create a confident retirement.
RiverSource® life insurance can help you:

Ensure survivor income. When structured properly, your beneficiaries will receive an income tax-free death benefit.1
Earn retirement income. Some RiverSource life insurance policies help you build cash value for future goals, such as retirement, by providing opportunities to participate in the growth potential of the market. Any potential earnings grow tax deferred, and you can access the cash value through income tax-free loans and withdrawals.
Transfer wealth. When you purchase a life insurance policy, you immediately secure a death benefit amount higher than the amount of premiums paid. Plus, instead of relying on asset growth, some life insurance policies offer the option of a lifetime guaranteed death benefit — helping you ensure your legacy.
Plan your estate. IRAs and 401(k)s are subject to income taxation when your beneficiaries access those assets after your death. Life insurance proceeds can help replace the amount of the legacy that is lost due to taxes.

Term life insurance offers you a simple, economical way to meet short-term protection goals.

Universal life insurance provides protection while offering the opportunity to build cash value. Because it's flexible, you can adjust benefits as your needs change.

1Generally the death benefit is income-tax free. For Income Protection Life a portion of the death benefit is taxable to the beneficiary.
All guarantees are based on the continued claims paying ability of the issuing company.
Accessing policy cash value through loans and surrenders may cause a permanent reduction of policy cash values and death benefit and negate any guarantees against lapse. The amount that can be borrowed or surrendered will be affected by the surrender charges applicable to the policy. Loans may be subject to interest charges. Although loans are generally not taxable, there may be tax consequences if the policy lapses or is surrendered with a loan (even as part of a 1035 exchange). It is possible that the amount of taxable income generated at the lapse or surrender of a policy with a loan may exceed the actual amount of cash received. Surrenders are generally taxable to the extent they exceed basis in the policy. If the policy is a modified endowment contract (MEC), pre-death distributions, including loans, from the policy are taxed on an income-first basis, and there may also be a 10% federal income tax penalty for distributions prior to age 59 ½.
Before you purchase, be sure to ask your financial advisor about the life insurance policy's features, benefits, risks and fees, and whether the life insurance is appropriate for you, based upon your financial situation and objectives. Variable life insurance is a complex investment vehicle that is subject to market risk, including the potential loss of principal invested.

History[edit]
The forerunner to RiverSource was established in 1894 as Investors Syndicate in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The syndicate changed its name to Investors Diversified Services, Inc. (IDS) in 1950.
In 1984 American Express bought IDS and integrated it into its own financial services division. In 2005, American Express spun off American Express Financial Advisors and it became an independent company named Ameriprise Financial. The new company created the RiverSource brand name for certain products and product lines.[1]
Products[edit]
Investments[edit]
RiverSource Investments provides mutual funds for individual investors and investment strategies for institutional investors.
William (Ted) Truscott, Ameriprise Financial chief investment officer and a former executive with Zurich Scudder Investments in Boston, joined what was then American Express Financial Advisors in 2001. He changed the structure of the mutual fund business by opening "boutique" offices in places such as Boston, Cambridge, Minneapolis and London, where portfolio managers hand-pick staff and develop their own investment strategies appropriate to the funds.

  (ii) RSLIC represents and warrants that the prospectus(es) and
            registration statement(s) relating to the Contracts and Future
             Contracts will contain no untrue statements of material fact or

statement(s) misleading.                          

(b)  Applications for Contracts and Future Contracts

(d)  Retention of Rights by RSLIC

      RDI, suspend sales of any Contract or Future Contract or amend any

        regulations or administrative order(s); or, (2) necessary to prevent
administrative or financial hardship to RSLIC. In all other 
 situations, RSLIC will provide 30 days notice to RDI prior to
     suspending sales of any Contract, Future Contract or amending any
        policies or contracts evidencing such Contracts or Future Contracts.

(e)  Payment of Amounts Due Selling Firms under Selling Agreements

        accordance with the terms of the Selling Agreement with each Selling
Firm ("Commission Processing Services"). RSLIC shall have no
        discretion as to either the timing or the amount of such payments to
 any Selling Firm. RSLIC will pay all such compensation to the
        Selling Firms in the name of RDI. If RSLIC provides these Commission

#ven                                                                            

P-->EX-99.3.16th Page of 27TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 6th
   Processing Services to RDI, then RSLIC's books and records will
     reflect all transactions performed on behalf of RDI in connection
     with these services. RSLIC will preserve and maintain these books
      and records in conformity with the requirements of Rules 17a-3 and
        17a-4 under the 1934 Act. RDI will retain overall responsibility for
 the records kept for it by RSLIC in providing these services,
  exactly as if RDI rather than RSLIC made these payments. RSLIC
    acknowledges that it holds all books and records with respect to
        these services on behalf of and as agent for RDI whose property they
are and shall remain.                                       

     If RSLIC provides Commission Processing Services to RDI, then RDI
   shall pay RSLIC its allocated cost of the Commission Processing
       Services using the same allocation procedures and methods set forth
      in section 7 below, except such allocations shall be made by RSLIC
       and paid by RDI, and provided further that all such allocated costs
 and expenses: a) shall be equitable among all parties to this
  Agreement; b) shall be in conformance with all state insurance
 regulatory requirements applicable to RSLIC; and, c) shall be
  accounted for by RDI in accordance with guidance issued by the
   Securities and Exchange Commission and by the NASD in Notice To
Members 03-63.                                              

(f)  Indemnification                                                  

      RSLIC hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify RDI against any
     and all claims, liabilities and expenses which RDI may incur from
     liabilities arising out of or based upon RSLIC's breach of any of
its duties under this Agreement.                            

(g)  Books, Records and Reports                                       

      RSLIC will comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act
    and the NASD including the requirements to maintain and preserve
       books and records pursuant to Section 17(a) of the 1934 Act and the
     rules thereunder regarding confirmations RSLIC sends on behalf of
     the Selling Firms for payments RSLIC receives under the Contracts
        and the Future Contracts, for transactions RSLIC processes under the
      Contracts and the Future Contracts, and for commissions related to
        the Contracts and Future which RSLIC pays to Selling Firms on behalf
       of RDI. RSLIC shall hold such books and records on behalf of and as
agent for RDI whose property they are and shall remain, and 
        acknowledges that such books and records are at all times subject to
      inspection by the SEC in accordance with Section 17(a) of the 1934
Act.                                                        

7.   COMPENSATION OF PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER.                                     

RSLIC agrees to reimburse RDI at cost for services provided by RDI    
 pursuant to this Agreement. The charge to RSLIC for such services shall
include all direct and indirectly allocable expenses. The methods for 
   allocating expenses to RSLIC shall be in accordance with the requirements
of the Minnesota insurance holding company system                     

#ven                                                                            

P-->EX-99.3.17th Page of 27TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 7th
laws. Such methods shall be modified and adjusted by mutual agreement 
   where necessary or appropriate to reflect fairly and equitably the actual
incidence of expense incurred by RDI on behalf of RSLIC. The method of
   allocating costs hereunder and the payment thereof shall be determined in
the following manner:                                                 

(a)  The cost of services performed by RDI that are identifiable as   
     expenses incurred directly and exclusively for the benefit of the
RSLIC shall be charged to RSLIC.                            

 (b)  The cost of services performed by RDI that are not identifiable as
       expenses incurred directly and exclusively for the benefit of RSLIC
        shall be allocated and charged to RSLIC in conformity with customary
insurance accounting practices.                             

(c)  At the request of RSLIC, and at RDI's expense, RDI shall produce 
       records and provide access to enable RSLIC to verify that such cost
allocations are performed in accordance with the practices  
referenced above.                                           

   (d)  For services rendered under this Agreement, payment shall be made by
      RSLIC to RDI on a monthly basis within thirty (30) days of invoice
    or other notice. The parties agree that during the course of any
        given month RSLIC may make reasonable estimated payments for part or
      all of the monthly cost in which case such payment shall be offset
   against the actual amount otherwise due at the end of the month
       under this Agreement. The parties also agree that, at the option of
       RSLIC, RSLIC may reimburse RDI based upon RDI's good faith estimate
 of the monthly costs for some or all of the services provided
   hereunder, in which case there shall be a final adjustment made
   within thirty (30) days after completion of RDI's cost analysis
performed at least annually.                                

For purposes of allocating costs under this Agreement, RSLIC and RDI  
shall rely on their internal accounting and allocation system then in 
effect, that system currently being the Management Accounting and     
Reporting System ("MARS"), which utilizes a product factor methodology
for certain services and rate-volume formulas for other services, in  
order to ensure fair and reasonable allocations of income and expenses
  among affiliated entities. Allocation of such costs under this Agreement
  shall be accounted for by RDI in accordance with applicable requirements
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and by the NASD including   
guidance provided in Notice To Members 03-63.                         

8.   TERMINATION.                                                               

This Agreement may be terminated, without cause, by either party upon 
sixty (60) days prior written notice, without penalty; and may be     
terminated immediately, by either party for failure to perform        
  satisfactorily or other cause; and will be terminated immediately if RDI
ceases to be registered as a broker dealer under the 1934 Act and a   
 member of the NASD. This Agreement will also terminate immediately upon
assignment without the prior written consent of both parties.         

9.   GENERAL PROVISIONS.                                                        

#ven

(a)  Amendment and Entirety                                           

      This is the entire Agreement between RSLIC and RDI with respect to
     the subject matter of this Agreement. No additions, amendments or
       modifications of this Agreement or any waiver of any provision will
       be valid unless approved, in writing, by authorized representatives
      of RSLIC and RDI. In addition, no waiver of any default or failure
       of performance by either party will affect the other party's rights
with respect to a subsequent default or failure.            

(b)  Independent Contractor Relationship                              

   This Agreement does not create the relationship of employer and
     employee between the parties to this Agreement. RSLIC and RDI are
 independent contractors with respect to each other, and their
respective employees and agents.                            

(c)  Assignment                                                       

       Neither RSLIC nor RDI will assign or transfer, in whole or in part,
this Agreement or any of the benefits accrued or to accrue  
hereunder, without prior written consent of an authorized   
representative of each party.                               

(d)  Governing Law                                                    

       It is agreed by the parties that this Agreement will be governed by
the laws of the State of Minnesota.                         

(e)  Severability                                                     

        It is understood and agreed by the parties that if any part, term or
    provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or in conflict
   with any law or regulation, the validity of the remaining part,
        terms or provisions will not be affected and the parties' rights and
       obligations will be construed and enforced as if this Agreement did
not contain the part, term or provision held to be invalid. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to  
be duly executed and attested as of the Effective Date.

                   monitoring Custodial IRAs with regard to compliance

                   "Your individual retirement annuity ("Annuity IRA")
                     has a tax-deferred feature under the Internal Revenue
                   Code, as does your Custodial IRA. As a result, when
                   you transfer your annuity IRA to the Custodial IRA,
              your annuity will not provide any necessary or
additional tax deferral.

                     However, your annuity IRA has features other than tax
                deferral that may help you reach your retirement
                     goals. Fees charged by the Insurance Company (if any)
                      will still apply as outlined in the annuity prospectus
and contract."

                     Authorized Selling Firm will provide RiverSource with
                    the name of its Custodian so that RiverSource has an
                      opportunity to conduct due diligence, should it choose
                     to do so. Any change in Custodian or trustee does not

                    act or omission by Authorized Selling Firm or any of

             costs or expenses to which Authorized Selling Firm, or any of
         its officers, directors and employees, may become subject
        (including any legal or other expenses incurred by it in
      connection with investigating any claim against it and
              defending any action and, provided RiverSource will have given
              prior written approval of such settlement or compromise, which
         consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, any
         amounts paid in settlement or compromise) insofar as such

expenses arise out of or are based upon:        

             7.2.1   The acts or omissions of RiverSource, or any employee
                      or agent of RiverSource, (excluding Authorized Selling

                      otherwise) on behalf of RiverSource in connection with
this Agreement;                 

       7.2.2   Any breach of any covenant or agreement made by
    RiverSource under this Agreement; or

   7.3     LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Each party agrees that, as between

   kind arising from this Agreement, including without

8.      ARBITRATION. The parties agree to attempt to settle any                 
   misunderstandings or disputes arising out of this Agreement through
 consultation and negotiation in good faith and a spirit of mutual
    cooperation. However, if those attempts fail, the parties agree that
     any misunderstandings or disputes arising from this Agreement will be
decided by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration 
   Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and
Title 9 of the U.S. Code. Judgment on the award rendered by the 
    arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
  The number of arbitrators will be three (unless the parties to the
    dispute agree on a single arbitrator), one of whom will be appointed
by the Company or an affiliate, one of whom will be appointed by
  Authorized Selling Firm; and the third of whom will be selected by
     mutual agreement, if possible, within 30 days of the selection of the
    second arbitrator and thereafter by the administering authority. The
      Arbitration shall be held in the city of the Company's principal place
    of business. The arbitrators will strictly observe the limitation of
liability provisions set forth in Section

    7.3 of this agreement in making any award and will have no authority
  to award punitive damages or any other damages not measured by the
      prevailing Party's actual damages, and may not, in any event, make any
ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and 
      conditions of this Agreement. The parties agree that the arbitrator(s)
      will decide which party must bear the expenses of the Arbitration. Any
   Party may make an application to the arbitrators seeking injunctive
    relief to maintain the status quo until such time as the arbitration
award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. This
     agreement to arbitrate shall not preclude either party from obtaining
      provisional remedies such as injunctive relief or the appointment of a
      receiver from a court having jurisdiction, before, during or after the
    pendency of the arbitration. The institution and maintenance of such
    provisional remedies shall not constitute a waiver of the right of a
party to submit a dispute to arbitration.                       

9.      TERMINATION.
