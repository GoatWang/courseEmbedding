Richard Calder













                    
                    Richard Calder was born in 1956, in Whitechapel, London. In the mid seventies he read English Literature at the University of Sussex. After graduating he travelled extensively throughout South-East Asia and Australia and, upon returning to the UK, subsequently worked in bookselling, independent television and the American Embassy's press office. He became a full-time author in 1990 after moving from London to Nongkhai, Thailand, a border town overlooking Laos. In 1998 he moved to the Philippines, where he lived for some years in Baguio City. After returning to London, he currently resides in another 'East' -- his native East End.His novels include the 'Dead' trilogy (Dead Girls, Dead Boys, Dead Things), Cythera, Frenzetta, The Twist, Malignos, Impakto, Lord Soho, and Babylon.He is currently adapting his novel Dead Girls into a graphic novel illustrated by Filipino artist Leonardo M Giron and published by The House of Murky Depths as an 8-comic series: www.deadgirls.co.uk

About Diamond



Renowned diamond expert Richard Calder founded Charm Diamond Centres over 40 years ago.  Richard has spent his life searching for and creating the world’s best bridal offerings for the Canadian Bride. From Richard’s extensive experience, he has brought this hand selected signature collection to life. 
It takes more than a name to produce an incredible diamond collection. Design integrity comes from years of understanding diamonds and gold, combining passion with design for  rings that will last a lifetime.  As a proud Canadian, Richard has also led the way in Canadian Diamonds, being one of the first retailers to introduce them to the world.  Now at the forefront of the industry, he is introducing the Charmed Designer Bridal Collection,  in which the centre diamonds are all hand-selected Canadian diamonds, a unique characteristic for a designer collection. Richard has also added an elegant signature touch for the Canadian Bride, a hidden Canadian diamond on the inside of the ring. Both diamonds are laser engraved and come with a certificate of Canadian authenticity.
