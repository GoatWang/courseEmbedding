Miller Jeffrey Allen



















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Iowa:













Does Miller Jeffrey Allen carry a valid contracting license?



Although a contractor license is not required in the state of Iowa, contractors earning more than $2000 per year from construction related work must register their business with the Iowa Division of Labor.











How important is contractor licensing in Iowa?



In Iowa, general contractors are not required to pass an exam to become licensed. However, plumbing and electrical contractors do have to pass a trade exam to obtain a license in Iowa.











Your liability risk when hiring Miller Jeffrey Allen



Registered contractors in Iowa are required to carry an active workers' compensation policy. In addition to workers' compensation insurance, it is always a good idea to hire contractors with general liability insurance. Be sure to request copies of certificates for both workers' compensation and general liabilty insurance 











Financial recourse when hiring Miller Jeffrey Allen



Iowa contractors are required to obtain a surety bond. Homeowners can file a claim against this bond in the event of faulty work or damaged property. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Iowa, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

I worked with Jeff in the Purchasing Dept. at Blue Water Automotive. He was a wonderful person and co-worker. Always smiling and always a kind and encouraging word for everyone. He will be missed by many.

Nancy, Jacob, Brian I am so sorry for your loss. I just heard this news and is very heavy on my heart. I worked with Jeff, but to refer to him as a co-worker is not nearly enough. Jeff was not only a consummate professional greatly respected by all that worked with him but much more Jeff was a man of great integrity, maintained strong principles, and always exhibited genuine character.

Nancy, Jacob, Brian  I am so sorry for your loss.   I just heard this news and is very heavy on my heart.   I worked with Jeff, but to refer to him as a co-worker is not nearly enough.   Jeff was not only a consummate professional  greatly respected by all that worked with him  but much more  Jeff was a man of great integrity, maintained strong principles, and always exhibited genuine character.  I often saw Jeff reach out to help others  including myself.   Recognition was not important to Jeff - doing the right thing was  even when it was the harder choice.   Jeff's word was gold as his words were always congruent with his actions.  When Jeff spoke of Nancy and his sons  his eyes would light up with pride and love.  Jeff also often talked about his brothers and was easy to see how proud he was of them and his close relationship with his brothers.   I feel very fortunate to have had Jeff as my friend-he was a special person.  I will miss him very much and never forget him or what he stood for. Nancy, please contact me at any time if there is anything I can ever do for you or your family.My deepest condolences, Michael Zugaro

Nancy, Jake and Brian.  Please accept my condolences.  I just heard this today from an old colleague.  I had spoken with Jeff last month and he was in his usual great spirits.   I will miss his friendship and rock solid character.  He was a great friend to me and a wonderful inspirational family man.  I will miss him very much.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do.    All the best, Michael Staver

Dear Miller Family,   I am sorry for your loss.  May each of you find comfort in knowing that God is "near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves." (Psalm 34;18)  He has promised to soon "swallow up death forever...and wipe the tears from all faces." (Isaiah 25;8)  With deepest sympathy,

Nancy, Jake and Brian, I am truly saddened by the news.  I sincerely enjoyed every campout that Jeff & I went on with the Scouts.  Jeff always wore such a big grin and kept such a great attitude.  His constant positive demeanor set a great example to both the boys and the adults. I will miss him.

I am so sorry to hear about the loss of Jeff.  He was a good friend and great racquetball player.  He will truly be missed by the racquetball group and he will be missed on Thompsono Pond.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
