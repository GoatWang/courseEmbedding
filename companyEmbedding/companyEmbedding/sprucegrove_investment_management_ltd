Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services
Many DB plan sponsors find it challenging to oversee plan portfolios while also managing other day-to-day responsibilities for their organizations. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers DB plan sponsors the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your plan and organization objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind.
OCIO: One service, many names


One approach defined benefit plans are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Optimizing your portfolio to meet your short- and long-term goals
Whether your DB plan is open or frozen, underfunded or approaching full funding, or if plan termination is a possibility, VIAS will help you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your plan investments are risk-appropriate, designed to achieve and maintain full funding, and aligned with your overall strategy. It does this by: 
Understanding your organization, your plan objectives, and your obligations. 
Developing a dynamic investment policy statement that identifies appropriate asset allocation strategies, including funded status triggers, to change the allocation to preserve gains in DB plan funded status.
Based on a proven investment philosophy, constructing a portfolio glide path to full funding and implementing that strategy.
Selecting the best investment minds to manage your portfolio.
Providing ongoing oversight, consultation, and reporting. 

Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset-liability modeling—or ALM—to assess your plan's strategic asset allocation relative to its liability.
Investment policy consulting that sets your plan on a path to full funding.
Product selection that focuses on low-cost investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insightsinto your DB portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Daily funded status monitor that flags funded status changes or when a trigger spelled out in our dynamic investment policy statement has been reached to change the asset allocation according to the plan's glide path.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness. 





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

Advisory services
Many organizations like yours find it challenging to oversee their portfolio while also managing the day-to-day responsibilities of running their endowment, foundation, or charitable organization. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers nonprofits the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind. VIAS strives to:

Understand your organization's mission, spending needs, and unique situation and offer sophisticated, unbiased advice.
Develop a low-cost portfolio customized to your organization's needs.
Relieve your staff of many of the day-to-day burdens of investment program management.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Investing and advising
Optimizing your portfolio to meet your long-term investment objectives requires time and skill. VIAS helps you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your investments are diversified, risk-appropriate, and aligned with your overall strategy.
Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset allocation analysis that uses a distinct, proprietary model to deliver solutions based on your portfolio needs.
Investment policy consulting designed to meet the unique investment goals of your organization.
Customized product selection that focuses on low-cost index and active investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insights into your portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Steadfast commitment to risk management and process excellence through ongoing portfolio monitoring and rebalancing.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness.





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. 
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

Enduring. Holistic.Defendable. Vanguard Target Retirement Funds










 



Not all target-date funds are created equal.™ 






Our infographic can help you evaluate your target-date fund (TDF) strategy. It includes three steps that focus on TDF costs, stability, and investor focus.                                 Learn more.






















Target-date strategies
Selecting a target-date fund (TDF) series for your qualified default investment alternative can be a critical step in designing a defined contribution (DC) retirement plan that can stand up to the scrutiny from many quarters, including regulators.

Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer a sophisticated design and a clear, straightforward glide path that's a natural fit for autoenrollment and default investment programs—a TDF strategy that can help lower your fiduciary risk and help improve the odds of your plan participants achieving their retirement goals.



Fiduciaries value not only the sophisticated methodology behind the Vanguard Target Retirement portfolio, but also the clarity of the glide path, index implementation, and high degree of transparency.
John Croke
Target Retirement Fund Product Manager










Enduring investment solution
With Vanguard, you'll have a target-date retirement solution that is implemented with a well-diversified set of market-cap-weighted index funds. The embedded diversification of this approach provides balance against the markets‘ natural ups and downs.





Reaching goals through a holistic approach
Vanguard's target-date funds are designed by investment, plan design, and participant behavior experts. This integrated approach puts participants at the heart of your target-date offering so you can have confidence that your target-date offering can help your participants reach their retirement goals.





Defendable performance year after year
The combination of consistent, prudent product oversight and our history of reducing costs help you deliver defensible performance to investment committees and plan participants year after year.


Sophisticated portfolio construction
The Target Retirement Funds are designed by Vanguard's respected investment managers and asset allocation experts and are grounded in ongoing, cross-disciplinary research. The glide path reflects a long-term, holistic view of retirement investing.



MORE ABOUT TARGET-DATE STRATEGIES
Research & commentary

* Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer the simplicity of an index-oriented, well-diversified portfolio that is strategic and straightforward in its approach. The funds are composed of five underlying index funds and follow an easy-to-understand asset allocation glide path. Underlying this simplicity is Vanguard's deep investment expertise, knowledge of the capital markets, and insights into participant behavior.
Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments (stocks) to more conservative ones (bonds and short-term reserves) based on its
                   target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
              
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.

Headnote
Exemption for pooled funds from the requirement to file with the Commission interim financial statements under section 77(2) of the Act and comparative financial statements under section 78(1) of the Act, subject to conditions.
Statutes Cited
Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5 as am., ss. 74(1).
National Instrument 13-101 -- System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR), s. 2.1(1)1.
Regulations Cited
Regulation made under the Securities Act, R.R.O. Reg. 1015, as am.
IN THE MATTER OF
THE SECURITIES ACT (ONTARIO), R.S.O. 1990,
CHAPTER S.5 AS AMENDED (THE "ACT")
AND
IN THE MATTER OF
SPRUCEGROVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT LTD.
AND
SPRUCEGROVE INTERNATIONAL POOLED FUND
SPRUCEGROVE GLOBAL POOLED FUND
SPRUCEGROVE SPECIAL INTERNATIONAL POOLED FUND
(The "Existing Pooled Funds")
 
ORDER
(Subsection 147 of the Act)
UPON the application (the "Application") of Sprucegrove Investment Management Ltd. ("Sprucegrove"), the manager of the Existing Pooled Funds and other pooled funds established and managed by Sprucegrove from time to time (collectively, the "Pooled Funds"), to the Ontario Securities Commission (the "Commission") for an order pursuant to subsection 147 of the Act exempting the Pooled Funds from filing with the Commission the interim and annual financial statements prescribed by sections 77(2) and 78(1), respectively, of the Act;
AND UPON considering the Application and the recommendation of the staff of the Commission;
AND UPON Sprucegrove having represented to the Commission that:

1. Sprucegrove is a corporation under the laws of Ontario with its head office in Ontario. Sprucegrove is, or will be, the manager of the Pooled Funds. Sprucegrove is registered with the Commission as an adviser in the categories of investment counsel and portfolio manager and as a dealer in the category of limited market dealer.
2. The Pooled Funds are, or will be, open-end mutual fund trusts established under the laws of Ontario. The Pooled Funds will not be reporting issuers in any province or territory of Canada. Units of the Pooled Funds are, or will be, distributed in each of the provinces and territories of Canada without a prospectus pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus delivery requirements of applicable securities legislation.
3. The Pooled Funds fit within the definition of "mutual fund in Ontario" in section 1(1) of the Act and are thus required to file with the Commission interim financial statements under section 77(2) of the Act and comparative annual financial statements under section 78(1) of the Act (collectively, the "Financial Statements").
4. While the Pooled Funds are structured as mutual funds, they are not public mutual funds. The Pooled Funds are not reporting issuers and are not sold to the general public.
5. Unitholders of the Pooled Funds ("Unitholders") receive the Financial Statements for the Pooled Funds they hold. The Financial Statements are prepared and delivered to Unitholders in the form and for the periods required under the Act and the regulation or rules made thereunder (the "Regulation"). Sprucegrove and the Pooled Funds may continue to rely on subsection 94(1) of the Regulation and will omit statements of portfolio transactions from the Financial Statements (such statements from which the statements of portfolio transactions have been omitted, the "Permitted Financial Statements").
6. As required by subsection 94(1) of the Regulation, the Permitted Financial Statements will contain a statement indicating that additional information as to portfolio transactions will be provided to a Unitholder without charge on request to a specified address and,

(a) the omitted information shall be sent promptly and without charge to each Unitholder that requests it in compliance with the indication; and
(b) where a person or company requests that such omitted information be sent routinely to the Unitholder, the request shall be carried out while the information continues to be omitted from the subsequent Financial Statements until the Unitholder requests, or agrees to, termination of the arrangement or is no longer a Unitholder.

7. Section 2.1(1)1 of National Instrument 13-101 - System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) ("Rule 13-101") requires that every issuer required to file a document under securities legislation make its filing through SEDAR. The Financial Statements filed with the Commission thus become publicly available.

AND UPON the Commission being satisfied that to do so would not be prejudicial to the public interest;
IT IS ORDERED by the Commission pursuant to subsection 147 of the Act that the Pooled Funds be exempted from the requirements in sections 77(2) and 78(1) of the Act to file the Financial Statements with the Commission provided:

(a) In the absence of other regulatory relief, the Pooled Funds will prepare and deliver to the Unitholders, the Permitted Financial Statements, in the form and for the periods required under the Act and the Regulation;
(b) The Pooled Funds will retain the Financial Statements indefinitely;
(c) The Pooled Funds will provide the Financial Statements to the Commission or any member, employee or agent of the Commission immediately upon request of the Commission or any member, employee or agent of the Commission;
(d) The Pooled Funds will provide a list of the Pooled Funds relying on this Order to the Investment Funds Branch of the Commission on an annual basis;
(e) Unitholders will be notified that the Pooled Funds are exempted from the requirements in sections 77(2) and 78(1) of the Act to file the Financial Statements with the Commission;
(f) In all other aspects, the Pooled Funds will comply with the requirements in Ontario securities law for financial statements; and
(g) This decision, as it relates to the Commission, will terminate after the coming into force of any legislation or rule of the Commission dealing with the matters regulated by sections 77(2) and 78(1) of the Act.

November 14, 2003.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.
