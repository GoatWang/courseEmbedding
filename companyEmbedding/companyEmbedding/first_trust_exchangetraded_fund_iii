FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Each of First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Asia Pacific ETF, First Trust RiverFront
Dynamic Developed International ETF and First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Europe
ETF (each, a "Fund," and, collectively, the "Funds") is a series of First Trust
Exchange-Traded Fund III (the "Trust") and an exchange-traded fund organized as
a separate series of a registered management investment company.


Each Fund intends to list and principally trade its shares on The Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC ("Nasdaq"). Market prices may differ to some degree from the net
asset value of the shares. Unlike mutual funds, each Fund issues and redeems
shares at net asset value, only in large specified blocks each consisting of
50,000 shares (each such block of shares called a "Creation Unit," and,
collectively, the "Creation Units"). Each Fund's Creation Units are generally
issued and redeemed in-kind for securities in which the Fund invests and, in
certain circumstances, for cash, and only to and from broker-dealers and large
institutional investors that have entered into participation agreements.


EACH FUND IS AN ACTIVELY MANAGED EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND AND, EXCEPT WHEN
AGGREGATED IN CREATION UNITS, ITS SHARES ARE NOT REDEEMABLE SECURITIES OF THE
FUND.


THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS NOT APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE
SECURITIES OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

SUMMARY INFORMATION

FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC ASIA PACIFIC ETF (RFAP)








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Asia Pacific ETF (the
"Fund") is to provide capital appreciation.






FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND



The following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and
hold shares of the Fund. Investors purchasing and selling shares may be subject
to costs (including customary brokerage commissions) charged by their broker,
which are not reflected in the table below.





SHAREHOLDER FEES (fees paid directly from your investment)









Maximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed on Purchases
(as a percentage of offering price)                                       None
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES (expenses that you pay each year
    as a percentage of the value of your investment)
  Management Fees                                                        0.83%
  Distribution and Service (12b-1) Fees(1)                               0.00%
  Other Expenses(2)                                                      0.00%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses                                   0.83%
================================================================================








(1)   Although the Fund has adopted a 12b-1 plan that permits it to pay up to
0.25% per annum, it will not pay 12b-1 fees at any time before February 4,
2018.

(2)   "Other Expenses" is an estimate based on the expenses the Fund expects to
incur for the current fiscal year.



EXAMPLE



The example below is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. This example does not take into
account customary brokerage commissions that you pay when purchasing or selling
shares of the Fund in the secondary market.


The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods
indicated. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each
year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain at current levels until
February 4, 2018, and thereafter at 1.08% to represent the imposition of the
12b-1 fee of 0.25% per annum of the Fund's average daily net assets. Although
your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs
would be:








                            1 YEAR           3 YEARS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             $85              $292
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------









PORTFOLIO TURNOVER



The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells
securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may
indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund
shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in
annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund's performance.






PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment
objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (including investment
borrowings) in a portfolio of equity securities of Asian Pacific companies,
including through investments in common stock, depositary receipts, and common
and preferred shares of real estate investment trusts ("REITs"), and forward
foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions used to hedge
the Fund's exposure to the currencies in which the equity securities of such
Asian Pacific companies are denominated (each, an "Asian Pacific currency" and,
collectively, the "Asian Pacific currencies"). Asian Pacific companies are those
companies (i) whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in an
Asian Pacific country, (ii) that have a primary business office in an Asian
Pacific country, or (iii) that have at least 50% of their assets in, or derive
at least 50% of their revenues or profits from, an Asian Pacific country. Asian
Pacific countries include the countries located in Asia and the Pacific Islands
as well as Australia and New Zealand. The Fund will generally focus its Asian
Pacific company investments in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and/or
Singapore.


The Fund will utilize a dynamic currency hedging strategy through the use of
forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions to
hedge up to 100% of the Fund's currency exposure. As a result of such dynamic


-1-








FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC ASIA PACIFIC ETF (RFAP)





currency hedging strategy, the portion of the Fund's portfolio securities which
are subject to currency hedging transactions may vary widely, from 0% to 100% of
the portfolio securities. A forward contract on foreign currency is an
obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may
be any fixed number of days agreed upon by the parties from the date of the
contract, at a price set on the date of the contract. A forward foreign currency
exchange contract may reduce the Fund's exposure to changes in the value of the
currency it will deliver and increase its exposure to changes in the value of
the currency it will receive for the duration of the contract. The effect on the
value of the Fund is similar to selling securities denominated in one currency
and purchasing securities denominated in another currency. The Fund also may
enter into currency spot transactions as part of its dynamic currency hedging
strategy. A currency spot transaction is an agreement between two parties to buy
or sell a specific currency for delivery on a date that is typically two
business days from the date of the agreement, as opposed to a date set in the
future. The underlying currencies of the forward foreign currency exchange
contracts and currency spot transactions included in the Fund's policy relating
to the investment of at least 80% of its net assets (including investment
borrowings) will be limited to Asian Pacific currencies.


The Fund also may invest up to 20% of its net assets in equity securities of
non-Asian Pacific companies, including companies in emerging market countries,
with a particular focus on companies in the United States and Canada, and
forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions used
to hedge the Fund's exposure to non-Asian Pacific currencies as well as any
proxy currency hedging transactions involving non-Asian Pacific currencies
determined by the Sub-Advisor to be representative of, and serve as a proxy for,
Asian Pacific currencies. The Fund will limit its investments in emerging market
countries in the aggregate to no more than 20% of its net assets. The Fund
considers an emerging market country to be any country whose issuers are
included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Index
and/or those countries considered to be developing by the World Bank, the
International Finance Corporation or the United Nations. The Fund considers an
"emerging market issuer" to be one (i) domiciled or with a principal place of
business or primary securities trading market in an emerging market country, or

(ii) that derives a substantial portion of its total revenues or profits from
emerging market countries. The equity securities of non-Asian Pacific companies
in which the Fund may invest include investments in common stock, depositary
receipts, common and preferred shares of REITs and business development
companies ("BDCs").


The securities in which the Fund may invest must be listed on a U.S. or non-U.S.
securities exchange. The Fund may invest in small, mid and large capitalization
companies.


In selecting the portfolio securities of the Fund, RiverFront Investment Group,
LLC, the Fund's sub-adviser ("RIG" or the "Sub-Advisor"), assembles a portfolio
of eligible securities based on several core attributes, including, but not
limited to, value, quality and momentum. The Sub-Advisor will consider multiple
factors within each core attribute, such as the price-to-book value of a
security when determining value and a company's cash as a percentage of the
company's market capitalization when determining quality. The Sub-Advisor then
assigns each qualifying security a score based on its core attributes and
selects the individual securities with the highest scores for investment. In
doing so, the Sub-Advisor utilizes its proprietary optimization process to
maximize the percentage of high-scoring securities included in the portfolio in
accordance with country, sector and risk factor (e.g., beta, quality volatility)
limitations. The Sub-Advisor will also consider the market capitalization of the
companies in which the Fund may invest, and the trading volume of a company's
shares in the secondary market.


In managing the Fund's currency exposure, the Sub-Advisor will deploy a dynamic
currency hedging strategy based on a proprietary hedging methodology that
considers a combination of quantitative measures, such as interest rate
differentials, central bank balance sheet expansion/contraction and price
momentum, and qualitative measures, such as formal and informal guidance from
central bankers.


To the extent permitted under applicable law, percentage limitations described
in this prospectus are generally as of the time of investment by the Fund and
may be exceeded on a going-forward basis as a result of market fluctuations
affecting the Fund's portfolio securities.


The Fund is classified as "non-diversified" under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").






PRINCIPAL RISKS



You could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not
a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no
assurance that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.


ASIA PACIFIC RISK. The Fund is more susceptible to the economic, market,
regulatory, political, natural disasters and local risks of the Asia Pacific
region than a fund that is more geographically diversified. The region has
historically been highly dependent on global trade, with nations taking strong
roles in both the importing and exporting of goods; such a relationship creates
a risk with this dependency on global growth. The respective stock markets tend


-2-








FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC ASIA PACIFIC ETF (RFAP)





to have a larger prevalence of smaller companies that are inherently more
volatile and less liquid than larger companies. Varying levels of accounting and
disclosure standards, restrictions on foreign ownership, minority ownership
rights and corporate governance standards are also common for the region.


BDC RISK. Investments in BDCs may be subject to a high degree of risk. A BDC's
portfolio typically will include a substantial amount of securities purchased in
private placements and, as a result, its portfolio may carry risks similar to
those of a private equity or private debt fund. Securities that are not publicly
registered may be difficult to value and may be difficult to sell at a price
representative of their intrinsic value. In addition, investments in BDCs are
subject to various other risks, including management's ability to meet the BDC's
investment objective and to manage the BDC's portfolio when the underlying
securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as
investors' perceptions regarding a BDC or its underlying investments change. BDC
shares are not redeemable at the option of the BDC shareholder and they may
trade in the secondary market at a discount to their net asset value. BDCs may
also employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through borrowings or the
issuance of preferred stock. Such use of leverage may subject the BDC to
increased risks, including the likelihood of increased volatility and the
possibility that the BDC's common share income may fall if the interest rate on
any borrowings rises. The Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of
any management and other operating expenses, and of any performance based or
incentive fees, charged by the BDCs in which it invests, in addition to the
expenses paid by the Fund.


CASH TRANSACTIONS RISK. The Fund may, under certain circumstances, effect
creations and redemptions, in whole or in part, for cash, rather than in-kind,
because of the nature of the Fund's underlying investments. As a result, an
investment in the Fund may be less tax efficient than it would be through more
frequent creations and redemptions in-kind.


COUNTERPARTY RISK. The Fund bears the risk that the counterparty to the Fund's
forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions may
default on its obligations or otherwise fail to honor its obligations. If a
counterparty defaults on its payment obligations, the Fund will lose money and
the value of an investment in Fund shares may decrease. In addition, the Fund
may engage in such investment transactions with a limited number of
counterparties.


CREDIT RISK. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable
or unwilling to make dividend payments when due and the related risk that the
value of a security may decline because of concerns about the issuer's ability
to make such payments.


CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK. The Fund will hold investments that are denominated
in non-U.S. currencies, or in securities that provide exposure to such
currencies, currency exchange rates or interest rates denominated in such
currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of
non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of the Fund's investments and the
value of Fund shares. Changes in currency exchange rates also may affect the
value of interest earned and gains and losses realized on the sale of
securities. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly
and unpredictably. As a result, the value of an investment in the Fund may
change quickly and without warning and you may lose money.


CURRENCY RISK. Because the Fund's net asset value is determined on the basis of
U.S. dollars and the Fund invests in non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities, you
may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the
U.S. dollar, even if the local currency value of the Fund's holdings goes up.
The Fund may hedge certain of its non-U.S. dollar holdings.


DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS RISK. Depositary receipts may be less liquid than the
underlying shares in their primary trading market. Any distributions paid to the
holders of depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the
depositary. Holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights, and
investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of
depositary receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert
shares into depositary receipts and vice versa. Such restrictions may cause
shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market
price of the depositary receipts.


DERIVATIVES RISK. The use of forward contracts and currency spot transactions
can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the
underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of
the derivatives.


In addition to the above risks, the Fund is "deemed" to have entered into an
ISDA Master Agreement (the "ISDA Master Agreement"), a standard umbrella
relationship-framework agreement between two parties under which one or more
individual derivatives transactions are entered. While most ISDA Master
Agreements are highly customized and heavily negotiated, a "deemed" ISDA Master
Agreement has predetermined elections. Therefore, the Fund may forego certain
protections they would have been afforded had they negotiated the ISDA Master
Agreements, such as terms related to choice of law, events of default,
termination events, payments on early termination, and calculation agents.

DYNAMIC HEDGING RISK. Because of the Fund's utilization of the dynamic currency
hedging strategy, the Fund may have lower returns than an equivalent
non-currency hedged investment when the component currencies are rising relative
to the U.S. dollar. As such, contracts to sell foreign currency will generally
be expected to limit any potential gain that might be realized by the Fund if
the value of the hedged currency increases. In addition, the use of currency
hedging will not necessarily eliminate exposure to all currency fluctuations.
Hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate
fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or
prevent a loss if the value of the security declines. Moreover, it may not be
possible for the Fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally
anticipated that the Fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a
price above the devaluation level it anticipates.


EMERGING MARKETS RISK. Investments in securities and instruments traded in
developing or emerging markets or that provide exposure to such securities or
markets can involve additional risks relating to political, economic or
regulatory conditions not associated with investments in U.S. securities and
instruments or investments in more developed international markets. Emerging
market governments may, without prior warning, impose capital controls on the
ability to transfer currency, securities or other assets. The Fund's ability to
access certain developing or emerging markets also may be limited due to a
variety of factors, including currency convertibility issues. Such conditions
may impact the ability of the Fund to buy, sell or otherwise transfer
securities, cause the Fund's returns to differ from those available to domestic
investors, adversely affect the trading market and price for Fund shares, and
cause the Fund to decline in value.


EQUITY SECURITIES RISK. Because the Fund invests in equity securities, the value
of the Fund's shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of its equity
securities. Equity securities prices fluctuate for several reasons, including
changes in investors' perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the
general condition of the relevant stock market, such as market volatility, or
when political or economic events affecting the issuer occur. In addition,
common stock prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates, as
the cost of the capital rises and borrowing costs increase.


FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS RISK. Forward foreign currency
exchange contracts involve certain risks, including the risk of failure of the
counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract and the risk that the
use of forward contracts may not serve as a complete hedge because of an
imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the contracts and the
prices of the currencies hedged. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts may
limit any potential gain that might result should the value of the underlying
currencies increase. In addition, because forward currency exchange contracts
are privately negotiated transactions, there can be no assurance that the Fund
will have flexibility to roll-over a forward currency exchange contract upon its
expiration if it desires to do so. Hedging against a decline in the value of a
currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security
traded in that currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines.


LIQUIDITY RISK. The Fund invests in equity securities that may have limited
liquidity despite being listed on a securities exchange. Equity securities that
are less liquid or that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy,
or to sell, compared to other more liquid or active investments. This liquidity
risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular security, as well as the
size and liquidity of the market for such security. The prices at which the
equity securities are held in the Fund will be adversely affected if trading
markets for the equity securities are limited or absent.


MANAGEMENT RISK. The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an
actively managed portfolio. In managing the Fund's investment portfolio, the
Sub-Advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have
the desired result. There can be no guarantee that the Fund will meet its
investment objective.


MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the
Fund or shares of the Fund in general, may fall in value. Securities are subject
to market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic, political, regulatory
or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in
securities prices. Overall securities values could decline generally or could
underperform other investments.


NEW FUND RISK. The Fund currently has fewer assets than larger funds, and like
other relatively new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the Fund's
market exposure for limited periods of time. This impact may be positive or
negative, depending on the direction of market movement during the period
affected. Also, during the initial invest-up period, the Fund may depart from
its principal investment strategies and invest a larger amount or all of its
assets in cash equivalents or it may hold cash.


NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISK. The Fund is classified as "non-diversified" under the
1940 Act. As a result, the Fund is only limited as to the percentage of its
assets which may be invested in the securities of any one issuer by the
diversification requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The Fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a
limited number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to a
single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these
issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain
issuers.


-4-








FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC ASIA PACIFIC ETF (RFAP)





NON-U.S. SECURITIES RISK. Non-U.S. securities are subject to higher volatility
than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse political, social or
economic developments, restrictions on foreign investment or exchange of
securities, lack of liquidity, currency exchange rates, excessive taxation,
government seizure of assets, different legal or accounting standards, and less
government supervision and regulation of exchanges in foreign countries.


PORTFOLIO TURNOVER RISK. High portfolio turnover may result in the Fund paying
higher levels of transaction costs and generating greater tax liabilities for
shareholders. Portfolio turnover risk may cause the Fund's performance to be
less than expected.


PREFERRED STOCK RISK. Preferred stocks combine some of the characteristics of
both common stocks and bonds. Preferred stocks are typically subordinated to
bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure in terms of
priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit
risk than those debt instruments. Preferred stocks are also subject to credit
risk, interest rate risk and income risk.


REIT INVESTMENT RISK. In addition to risks related to investments in real estate
generally, investing in REITs involves certain other risks related to their
structure and focus, which include, but are not limited to, dependency upon
management skills, limited diversification, the risks of locating and managing
financing for projects, heavy cash flow dependency, possible default by
borrowers, the costs and potential losses of self-liquidation of one or more
holdings, the risk of a possible lack of mortgage funds and associated interest
rate risks, overbuilding, property vacancies, increases in property taxes and
operating expenses, changes in zoning laws, losses due to environmental damages,
changes in neighborhood values and appeal to purchases, the possibility of
failing to maintain exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act and, in many
cases, relatively small market capitalization, which may result in less market
liquidity and greater price volatility. REITs are also subject to the risk that
the real estate market may experience an economic downturn generally, which may
have a material effect on the real estate in which the REITs invest and their
underlying portfolio securities.


SMALLER COMPANIES RISK. The Fund may invest in small- and mid-capitalization
companies. Such companies may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or
economic developments, and their securities may be less liquid and may
experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies as a
result of several factors, including limited trading volumes, products or
financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available
information. Accordingly, such companies are generally subject to greater market
risk than larger, more established companies.






PERFORMANCE



The Fund has not yet commenced operations and, therefore, does not have a
performance history. Once available, the Fund's performance information, and
information that gives some indication of the risks of an investment in the Fund
by comparing the Fund's performance with a broad measure of market performance,
will be available on the Fund's website at www.ftportfolios.com. The Fund's past
performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the
Fund will perform in the future.

PURCHASE AND SALE OF FUND SHARES



The Fund issues and redeems shares on a continuous basis, at net asset value,
only in Creation Units consisting of 50,000 shares. The Fund's Creation Units
are generally issued and redeemed in-kind for securities in which the Fund
invests and, in certain circumstances, for cash, and only to and from
broker-dealers and large institutional investors that have entered into
participation agreements. Individual shares of the Fund may only be purchased
and sold on Nasdaq through a broker-dealer. Shares of the Fund will trade on
Nasdaq at market prices rather than net asset value, which may cause the shares
to trade at a price greater than net asset value (premium) or less than net
asset value (discount).



TAX INFORMATION



The Fund's distributions are taxable and will generally be taxed as ordinary
income or capital gains. Distributions on shares held in a tax-deferred account,
while not immediately taxable, will be subject to tax when the shares are no
longer held in a tax-deferred account.



PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES



If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial
intermediary (such as a bank), First Trust and First Trust Portfolios L.P., the
Fund's distributor, may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and
related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by
influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to
recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your
financial intermediary's website for more information.

SUMMARY INFORMATION



FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC DEVELOPED INTERNATIONAL ETF (RFDI)








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Developed
International ETF (the "Fund") is to provide capital appreciation.






FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND



The following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and
hold shares of the Fund. Investors purchasing and selling shares may be subject
to costs (including customary brokerage commissions) charged by their broker,
which are not reflected in the table below.





SHAREHOLDER FEES (fees paid directly from your investment)









Maximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed on Purchases
(as a percentage of offering price)                                       None
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES (expenses that you pay each year
    as a percentage of the value of your investment)
  Management Fees                                                        0.83%
  Distribution and Service (12b-1) Fees(1)                               0.00%
  Other Expenses(2)                                                      0.00%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses                                   0.83%
================================================================================








(1)   Although the Fund has adopted a 12b-1 plan that permits it to pay up to
0.25% per annum, it will not pay 12b-1 fees at any time before February 4,
2018.

(2)   "Other Expenses" is an estimate based on the expenses the Fund expects to
incur for the current fiscal year.



EXAMPLE



The example below is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. This example does not take into
account customary brokerage commissions that you pay when purchasing or selling
shares of the Fund in the secondary market.


The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods
indicated. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each
year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain at current levels until
February 4, 2018, and thereafter at 1.08% to represent the imposition of the
12b-1 fee of 0.25% per annum of the Fund's average daily net assets. Although
your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs
would be:








                            1 YEAR           3 YEARS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             $85              $292
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------









PORTFOLIO TURNOVER



The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells
securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may
indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund
shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in
annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund's performance.






PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment
objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (including investment
borrowings) in a portfolio of equity securities of developed market companies,
including through investments in common stock, depositary receipts, and common
and preferred shares of real estate investment trusts ("REITs"), and forward
foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions used to hedge
the Fund's exposure to the currencies in which the equity securities of such
developed market companies are denominated (each, a "Developed Market currency"
and, collectively, the "Developed Market currencies"). Developed market
companies are those companies (i) whose securities are traded principally on a
stock exchange in a developed market country, (ii) that have a primary business
office in a developed market country, or (iii) that have at least 50% of their
assets in, or derive at least 50% of their revenues or profits from, a developed
market country. Developed market countries currently include the countries
comprising the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index or countries
considered to be developed by the World Bank, the International Finance
Corporation or the United Nations. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will
invest in at least three countries and at least 40% of its net assets in
countries other than the United States.

FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC DEVELOPED INTERNATIONAL ETF (RFDI)




The Fund will utilize a dynamic currency hedging strategy through the use of
forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions to
hedge up to 100% of the Fund's currency exposure. As a result of such dynamic
currency hedging strategy, the portion of the Fund's portfolio securities which
are subject to currency hedging transactions may vary widely, from 0% to 100% of
the portfolio securities. A forward contract on foreign currency is an
obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may
be any fixed number of days agreed upon by the parties from the date of the
contract, at a price set on the date of the contract. A forward foreign currency
exchange contract may reduce the Fund's exposure to changes in the value of the
currency it will deliver and increase its exposure to changes in the value of
the currency it will receive for the duration of the contract. The effect on the
value of the Fund is similar to selling securities denominated in one currency
and purchasing securities denominated in another currency. The Fund also may
enter into currency spot transactions as part of its dynamic currency hedging
strategy. A currency spot transaction is an agreement between two parties to buy
or sell a specific currency for delivery on a date that is typically two
business days from the date of the agreement, as opposed to a date set in the
future. The underlying currencies of the forward foreign currency exchange
contracts and currency spot transactions included in the Fund's policy relating
to the investment of at least 80% of its net assets (including investment
borrowings) will be limited to Developed Market currencies.


The Fund also may invest up to 20% of its net assets in companies of emerging
market countries and forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency
spot transactions used to hedge the Fund's exposure to non-Developed Market
currencies as well as any proxy currency hedging transactions involving
non-Developed Market currencies determined by the Sub-Advisor to be
representative of, and serve as a proxy for, Developed Market currencies. Such
emerging market companies are companies (i) whose securities are traded
principally on a stock exchange in a country that is not a developed market
country, (ii) that have a primary business office in a country that is not a
developed market country, or (iii) that have at least 50% of their assets in, or
derive at least 50% of their revenues or profits from, a country that is not a
developed market country. The equity securities of emerging market companies in
which the Fund may invest include investments in common stock, depositary
receipts, common and preferred shares of REITs and business development
companies ("BDCs").


The securities in which the Fund may invest must be listed on a U.S. or non-U.S.
securities exchange. The Fund may invest in small, mid and large capitalization
companies.


In selecting the portfolio securities of the Fund, RiverFront Investment Group,
LLC, the Fund's sub-adviser ("RIG" or the "Sub-Advisor"), assembles a portfolio
of eligible securities based on several core attributes, including, but not
limited to, value, quality and momentum. The Sub-Advisor will consider multiple
factors within each core attribute, such as the price-to-book value of a
security when determining value and a company's cash as a percentage of the
company's market capitalization when determining quality. The Sub-Advisor then
assigns each qualifying security a score based on its core attributes and
selects the individual securities with the highest scores for investment. In
doing so, the Sub-Advisor utilizes its proprietary optimization process to
maximize the percentage of high-scoring securities included in the portfolio in
accordance with country, sector and risk factor (e.g., beta, quality volatility)
limitations. The Sub-Advisor will also consider the market capitalization of the
companies in which the Fund may invest, and the trading volume of a company's
shares in the secondary market.


In managing the Fund's currency exposure, the Sub-Advisor will deploy a dynamic
currency hedging strategy based on a proprietary hedging methodology that
considers a combination of quantitative measures, such as interest rate
differentials, central bank balance sheet expansion/contraction and price
momentum, and qualitative measures, such as formal and informal guidance from
central bankers.


To the extent permitted under applicable law, percentage limitations described
in this prospectus are generally as of the time of investment by the Fund and
may be exceeded on a going-forward basis as a result of market fluctuations
affecting the Fund's portfolio securities.


The Fund is classified as "non-diversified" under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").






PRINCIPAL RISKS



You could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not
a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no
assurance that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.


BDC RISK. Investments in BDCs may be subject to a high degree of risk. A BDC's
portfolio typically will include a substantial amount of securities purchased in
private placements and, as a result, its portfolio may carry risks similar to
those of a private equity or private debt fund. Securities that are not publicly
registered may be difficult to value and may be difficult to sell at a price
representative of their intrinsic value. In addition, investments in BDCs are
subject to various other risks, including management's ability to meet the BDC's
investment objective and to manage the BDC's portfolio when the underlying


-8-








FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC DEVELOPED INTERNATIONAL ETF (RFDI)




securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as
investors' perceptions regarding a BDC or its underlying investments change. BDC
shares are not redeemable at the option of the BDC shareholder and they may
trade in the secondary market at a discount to their net asset value. BDCs may
also employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through borrowings or the
issuance of preferred stock. Such use of leverage may subject the BDC to
increased risks, including the likelihood of increased volatility and the
possibility that the BDC's common share income may fall if the interest rate on
any borrowings rises. The Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of
any management and other operating expenses, and of any performance based or
incentive fees, charged by the BDCs in which it invests, in addition to the
expenses paid by the Fund.


CASH TRANSACTIONS RISK. The Fund may, under certain circumstances, effect
creations and redemptions, in whole or in part, for cash, rather than in-kind,
because of the nature of the Fund's underlying investments. As a result, an
investment in the Fund may be less tax efficient than it would be through more
frequent creations and redemptions in-kind.


COUNTERPARTY RISK. The Fund bears the risk that the counterparty to the Fund's
forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions may
default on its obligations or otherwise fail to honor its obligations. If a
counterparty defaults on its payment obligations, the Fund will lose money and
the value of an investment in Fund shares may decrease. In addition, the Fund
may engage in such investment transactions with a limited number of
counterparties.


CREDIT RISK. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable
or unwilling to make dividend payments when due and the related risk that the
value of a security may decline because of concerns about the issuer's ability
to make such payments.


CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK. The Fund will hold investments that are denominated
in non-U.S. currencies, or in securities that provide exposure to such
currencies, currency exchange rates or interest rates denominated in such
currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of
non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of the Fund's investments and the
value of Fund shares. Changes in currency exchange rates also may affect the
value of interest earned and gains and losses realized on the sale of
securities. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly
and unpredictably. As a result, the value of an investment in the Fund may
change quickly and without warning and you may lose money.


CURRENCY RISK. Because the Fund's net asset value is determined on the basis of
U.S. dollars and the Fund invests in non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities, you
may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the
U.S. dollar, even if the local currency value of the Fund's holdings goes up.
The Fund may hedge certain of its non-U.S. dollar holdings.


DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS RISK. Depositary receipts may be less liquid than the
underlying shares in their primary trading market. Any distributions paid to the
holders of depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the
depositary. Holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights, and
investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of
depositary receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert
shares into depositary receipts and vice versa. Such restrictions may cause
shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market
price of the depositary receipts.


DERIVATIVES RISK. The use of forward contracts and currency spot transactions
can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the
underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of
the derivatives.


In addition to the above risks, the Fund is "deemed" to have entered into an
ISDA Master Agreement (the "ISDA Master Agreement"), a standard umbrella
relationship-framework agreement between two parties under which one or more
individual derivatives transactions are entered. While most ISDA Master
Agreements are highly customized and heavily negotiated, a "deemed" ISDA Master
Agreement has predetermined elections. Therefore, the Fund may forego certain
protections they would have been afforded had they negotiated the ISDA Master
Agreements, such as terms related to choice of law, events of default,
termination events, payments on early termination, and calculation agents.


DYNAMIC HEDGING RISK. Because of the Fund's utilization of the dynamic currency
hedging strategy, the Fund may have lower returns than an equivalent
non-currency hedged investment when the component currencies are rising relative
to the U.S. dollar. As such, contracts to sell foreign currency will generally
be expected to limit any potential gain that might be realized by the Fund if
the value of the hedged currency increases. In addition, the use of currency
hedging will not necessarily eliminate exposure to all currency fluctuations.
Hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate
fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or
prevent a loss if the value of the security declines. Moreover, it may not be
possible for the Fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally
anticipated that the Fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a
price above the devaluation level it anticipates.


-9-








FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC DEVELOPED INTERNATIONAL ETF (RFDI)




EMERGING MARKETS RISK. Investments in securities and instruments traded in
developing or emerging markets or that provide exposure to such securities or
markets can involve additional risks relating to political, economic or
regulatory conditions not associated with investments in U.S. securities and
instruments or investments in more developed international markets. Emerging
market governments may, without prior warning, impose capital controls on the
ability to transfer currency, securities or other assets. The Fund's ability to
access certain developing or emerging markets also may be limited due to a
variety of factors, including currency convertibility issues. Such conditions
may impact the ability of the Fund to buy, sell or otherwise transfer
securities, cause the Fund's returns to differ from those available to domestic
investors, adversely affect the trading market and price for Fund shares, and
cause the Fund to decline in value.


EQUITY SECURITIES RISK. Because the Fund invests in equity securities, the value
of the Fund's shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of its equity
securities. Equity securities prices fluctuate for several reasons, including
changes in investors' perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the
general condition of the relevant stock market, such as market volatility, or
when political or economic events affecting the issuer occur. In addition,
common stock prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates, as
the cost of the capital rises and borrowing costs increase.


FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS RISK. Forward foreign currency
exchange contracts involve certain risks, including the risk of failure of the
counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract and the risk that the
use of forward contracts may not serve as a complete hedge because of an
imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the contracts and the
prices of the currencies hedged. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts may
limit any potential gain that might result should the value of the underlying
currencies increase. In addition, because forward currency exchange contracts
are privately negotiated transactions, there can be no assurance that the Fund
will have flexibility to roll-over a forward currency exchange contract upon its
expiration if it desires to do so. Hedging against a decline in the value of a
currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security
traded in that currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines.


LIQUIDITY RISK. The Fund invests in equity securities that may have limited
liquidity despite being listed on a securities exchange. Equity securities that
are less liquid or that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy,
or to sell, compared to other more liquid or active investments. This liquidity
risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular security, as well as the
size and liquidity of the market for such security. The prices at which the
equity securities are held in the Fund will be adversely affected if trading
markets for the equity securities are limited or absent.


MANAGEMENT RISK. The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an
actively managed portfolio. In managing the Fund's investment portfolio, the
Sub-Advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have
the desired result. There can be no guarantee that the Fund will meet its
investment objective.


MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the
Fund or shares of the Fund in general, may fall in value. Securities are subject
to market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic, political, regulatory
or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in
securities prices. Overall securities values could decline generally or could
underperform other investments.


NEW FUND RISK. The Fund currently has fewer assets than larger funds, and like
other relatively new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the Fund's
market exposure for limited periods of time. This impact may be positive or
negative, depending on the direction of market movement during the period
affected. Also, during the initial invest-up period, the Fund may depart from
its principal investment strategies and invest a larger amount or all of its
assets in cash equivalents or it may hold cash.


NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISK. The Fund is classified as "non-diversified" under the
1940 Act. As a result, the Fund is only limited as to the percentage of its
assets which may be invested in the securities of any one issuer by the
diversification requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The Fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a
limited number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to a
single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these
issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain
issuers.


NON-U.S. SECURITIES RISK. Non-U.S. securities are subject to higher volatility
than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse political, social or
economic developments, restrictions on foreign investment or exchange of
securities, lack of liquidity, currency exchange rates, excessive taxation,
government seizure of assets, different legal or accounting standards, and less
government supervision and regulation of exchanges in foreign countries.


PORTFOLIO TURNOVER RISK. High portfolio turnover may result in the Fund paying
higher levels of transaction costs and generating greater tax liabilities for
shareholders. Portfolio turnover risk may cause the Fund's performance to be
less than expected.

PREFERRED STOCK RISK. Preferred stocks combine some of the characteristics of
both common stocks and bonds. Preferred stocks are typically subordinated to
bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure in terms of
priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit
risk than those debt instruments. Preferred stocks are also subject to credit
risk, interest rate risk and income risk.


REIT INVESTMENT RISK. In addition to risks related to investments in real estate
generally, investing in REITs involves certain other risks related to their
structure and focus, which include, but are not limited to, dependency upon
management skills, limited diversification, the risks of locating and managing
financing for projects, heavy cash flow dependency, possible default by
borrowers, the costs and potential losses of self-liquidation of one or more
holdings, the risk of a possible lack of mortgage funds and associated interest
rate risks, overbuilding, property vacancies, increases in property taxes and
operating expenses, changes in zoning laws, losses due to environmental damages,
changes in neighborhood values and appeal to purchases, the possibility of
failing to maintain exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act and, in many
cases, relatively small market capitalization, which may result in less market
liquidity and greater price volatility. REITs are also subject to the risk that
the real estate market may experience an economic downturn generally, which may
have a material effect on the real estate in which the REITs invest and their
underlying portfolio securities.


SMALLER COMPANIES RISK. The Fund may invest in small- and mid-capitalization
companies. Such companies may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or
economic developments, and their securities may be less liquid and may
experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies as a
result of several factors, including limited trading volumes, products or
financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available
information. Accordingly, such companies are generally subject to greater market
risk than larger, more established companies.






PERFORMANCE



The Fund has not yet commenced operations and, therefore, does not have a
performance history. Once available, the Fund's performance information, and
information that gives some indication of the risks of an investment in the Fund
by comparing the Fund's performance with a broad measure of market performance,
will be available on the Fund's website at www.ftportfolios.com. The Fund's past
performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the
Fund will perform in the future.

FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC DEVELOPED INTERNATIONAL ETF (RFDI)




and sold on Nasdaq through a broker-dealer. Shares of the Fund will trade on
Nasdaq at market prices rather than net asset value, which may cause the shares
to trade at a price greater than net asset value (premium) or less than net
asset value (discount).



TAX INFORMATION



The Fund's distributions are taxable and will generally be taxed as ordinary
income or capital gains. Distributions on shares held in a tax-deferred account,
while not immediately taxable, will be subject to tax when the shares are no
longer held in a tax-deferred account.



PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES



If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial
intermediary (such as a bank), First Trust and First Trust Portfolios L.P., the
Fund's distributor, may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and
related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by
influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to
recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your
financial intermediary's website for more information.

SUMMARY INFORMATION

FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC EUROPE ETF (RFEU)









INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Europe ETF (the
"Fund") is to provide capital appreciation.






FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND



The following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and
hold shares of the Fund. Investors purchasing and selling shares may be subject
to costs (including customary brokerage commissions) charged by their broker,
which are not reflected in the table below.





SHAREHOLDER FEES (fees paid directly from your investment)









Maximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed on Purchases
(as a percentage of offering price)                                       None
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES (expenses that you pay each year
    as a percentage of the value of your investment)
  Management Fees                                                        0.83%
  Distribution and Service (12b-1) Fees(1)                               0.00%
  Other Expenses(2)                                                      0.00%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses                                   0.83%
================================================================================








(1)   Although the Fund has adopted a 12b-1 plan that permits it to pay up to
0.25% per annum, it will not pay 12b-1 fees at any time before February 4,
2018.

(2)   "Other Expenses" is an estimate based on the expenses the Fund expects to
incur for the current fiscal year.



EXAMPLE



The example below is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. This example does not take into
account customary brokerage commissions that you pay when purchasing or selling
shares of the Fund in the secondary market.


The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods
indicated. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each
year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain at current levels until
February 4, 2018, and thereafter at 1.08% to represent the imposition of the
12b-1 fee of 0.25% per annum of the Fund's average daily net assets. Although
your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs
would be:








                            1 YEAR           3 YEARS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             $85              $292
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------









PORTFOLIO TURNOVER



The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells
securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may
indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund
shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in
annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund's performance.






PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment
objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (including investment
borrowings) in a portfolio of equity securities of European companies, including
through investments in common stock, depositary receipts, and common and
preferred shares of real estate investment trusts ("REITs"), and forward foreign
currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions used to hedge the
Fund's exposure to the currencies in which the equity securities of such
European companies are denominated (each, a "European currency" and,
collectively, the "European currencies"). European companies are those companies

(i) whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in a European
country, (ii) that have a primary business office in a European country, or

(iii) that have at least 50% of their assets in, or derive at least 50% of their
revenues or profits from, a European country. The Fund considers a European
country to be any member country of the European Union or any country included
in the FTSE Developed Europe Index or the FTSE Emerging Europe All Cap Index.
The Fund will generally focus its European company investments in Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and/or the United
Kingdom.


-13-








FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC EUROPE ETF (RFEU)





The Fund will utilize a dynamic currency hedging strategy through the use of
forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions to
hedge up to 100% of the Fund's currency exposure. As a result of such dynamic
currency hedging strategy, the portion of the Fund's portfolio securities which
are subject to currency hedging transactions may vary widely, from 0% to 100% of
the portfolio securities. A forward contract on foreign currency is an
obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may
be any fixed number of days agreed upon by the parties from the date of the
contract, at a price set on the date of the contract. A forward foreign currency
exchange contract may reduce the Fund's exposure to changes in the value of the
currency it will deliver and increase its exposure to changes in the value of
the currency it will receive for the duration of the contract. The effect on the
value of the Fund is similar to selling securities denominated in one currency
and purchasing securities denominated in another currency. The Fund also may
enter into currency spot transactions as part of its dynamic currency hedging
strategy. A currency spot transaction is an agreement between two parties to buy
or sell a specific currency for delivery on a date that is typically two
business days from the date of the agreement, as opposed to a date set in the
future. The underlying currencies of the forward foreign currency exchange
contracts and currency spot transactions included in the Fund's policy relating
to the investment of at least 80% of its net assets (including investment
borrowings) will be limited to European currencies.


The Fund also may invest up to 20% of its net assets in equity securities of
non-European companies, including companies in emerging market countries, with a
particular focus on companies in Canada, Israel and the United States, and
forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions used
to hedge the Fund's exposure to non-European currencies as well as any proxy
currency hedging transactions involving non-European currencies determined by
the Sub-Advisor to be representative of, and serve as a proxy for, European
currencies. The Fund will limit its investments in emerging market countries in
the aggregate to no more than 20% of its net assets. The Fund considers an
emerging market country to be any country whose issuers are included in the
Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Index and/or those
countries considered to be developing by the World Bank, the International
Finance Corporation or the United Nations. The Fund considers an "emerging
market issuer" to be one (i) domiciled or with a principal place of business or
primary securities trading market in an emerging market country, or (ii) that
derives a substantial portion of its total revenues or profits from emerging
market countries. The equity securities of non-European companies in which the
Fund may invest include investments in common stock, depositary receipts, common
and preferred shares of REITs and business development companies ("BDCs").


The securities in which the Fund may invest must be listed on a U.S. or non-U.S.
securities exchange. The Fund may invest in small, mid and large capitalization
companies.


In selecting the portfolio securities of the Fund, RiverFront Investment Group,
LLC, the Fund's sub-adviser ("RIG" or the "Sub-Advisor"), assembles a portfolio
of eligible securities based on several core attributes, including, but not
limited to, value, quality and momentum. The Sub-Advisor will consider multiple
factors within each core attribute, such as the price-to-book value of a
security when determining value and a company's cash as a percentage of the
company's market capitalization when determining quality. The Sub-Advisor then
assigns each qualifying security a score based on its core attributes and
selects the individual securities with the highest scores for investment. In
doing so, the Sub-Advisor utilizes its proprietary optimization process to
maximize the percentage of high-scoring securities included in the portfolio in
accordance with country, sector and risk factor (e.g., beta, quality volatility)
limitations. The Sub-Advisor will also consider the market capitalization of the
companies in which the Fund may invest, and the trading volume of a company's
shares in the secondary market.


In managing the Fund's currency exposure, the Sub-Advisor will deploy a dynamic
currency hedging strategy based on a proprietary hedging methodology that
considers a combination of quantitative measures, such as interest rate
differentials, central bank balance sheet expansion/contraction and price
momentum, and qualitative measures, such as formal and informal guidance from
central bankers.


To the extent permitted under applicable law, percentage limitations described
in this prospectus are generally as of the time of investment by the Fund and
may be exceeded on a going-forward basis as a result of market fluctuations
affecting the Fund's portfolio securities.


The Fund is classified as "non-diversified" under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").






PRINCIPAL RISKS



You could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not
a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no
assurance that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.


BDC RISK. Investments in BDCs may be subject to a high degree of risk. A BDC's
portfolio typically will include a substantial amount of securities purchased in
private placements and, as a result, its portfolio may carry risks similar to


-14-








FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC EUROPE ETF (RFEU)





those of a private equity or private debt fund. Securities that are not publicly
registered may be difficult to value and may be difficult to sell at a price
representative of their intrinsic value. In addition, investments in BDCs are
subject to various other risks, including management's ability to meet the BDC's
investment objective and to manage the BDC's portfolio when the underlying
securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as
investors' perceptions regarding a BDC or its underlying investments change. BDC
shares are not redeemable at the option of the BDC shareholder and they may
trade in the secondary market at a discount to their net asset value. BDCs may
also employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through borrowings or the
issuance of preferred stock. Such use of leverage may subject the BDC to
increased risks, including the likelihood of increased volatility and the
possibility that the BDC's common share income may fall if the interest rate on
any borrowings rises. The Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of
any management and other operating expenses, and of any performance based or
incentive fees, charged by the BDCs in which it invests, in addition to the
expenses paid by the Fund.


CASH TRANSACTIONS RISK. The Fund may, under certain circumstances, effect
creations and redemptions, in whole or in part, for cash, rather than in-kind,
because of the nature of the Fund's underlying investments. As a result, an
investment in the Fund may be less tax efficient than it would be through more
frequent creations and redemptions in-kind.


COUNTERPARTY RISK. The Fund bears the risk that the counterparty to the Fund's
forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions may
default on its obligations or otherwise fail to honor its obligations. If a
counterparty defaults on its payment obligations, the Fund will lose money and
the value of an investment in Fund shares may decrease. In addition, the Fund
may engage in such investment transactions with a limited number of
counterparties.


CREDIT RISK. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable
or unwilling to make dividend payments when due and the related risk that the
value of a security may decline because of concerns about the issuer's ability
to make such payments.


CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK. The Fund will hold investments that are denominated
in non-U.S. currencies, or in securities that provide exposure to such
currencies, currency exchange rates or interest rates denominated in such
currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of
non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of the Fund's investments and the
value of Fund shares. Changes in currency exchange rates also may affect the
value of interest earned and gains and losses realized on the sale of
securities. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly
and unpredictably. As a result, the value of an investment in the Fund may
change quickly and without warning and you may lose money.


CURRENCY RISK. Because the Fund's net asset value is determined on the basis of
U.S. dollars and the Fund invests in non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities, you
may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the
U.S. dollar, even if the local currency value of the Fund's holdings goes up.
The Fund may hedge certain of its non-U.S. dollar holdings.


DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS RISK. Depositary receipts may be less liquid than the
underlying shares in their primary trading market. Any distributions paid to the
holders of depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the
depositary. Holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights, and
investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of
depositary receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert
shares into depositary receipts and vice versa. Such restrictions may cause
shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market
price of the depositary receipts.


DERIVATIVES RISK. The use of forward contracts and currency spot transactions
can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the
underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of
the derivatives.


In addition to the above risks, the Fund is "deemed" to have entered into an
ISDA Master Agreement (the "ISDA Master Agreement"), a standard umbrella
relationship-framework agreement between two parties under which one or more
individual derivatives transactions are entered. While most ISDA Master
Agreements are highly customized and heavily negotiated, a "deemed" ISDA Master
Agreement has predetermined elections. Therefore, the Fund may forego certain
protections they would have been afforded had they negotiated the ISDA Master
Agreements, such as terms related to choice of law, events of default,
termination events, payments on early termination, and calculation agents.


DYNAMIC HEDGING RISK. Because of the Fund's utilization of the dynamic currency
hedging strategy, the Fund may have lower returns than an equivalent
non-currency hedged investment when the component currencies are rising relative
to the U.S. dollar. As such, contracts to sell foreign currency will generally
be expected to limit any potential gain that might be realized by the Fund if
the value of the hedged currency increases. In addition, the use of currency
hedging will not necessarily eliminate exposure to all currency fluctuations.
Hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate
fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or


-15-








FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC EUROPE ETF (RFEU)





prevent a loss if the value of the security declines. Moreover, it may not be
possible for the Fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally
anticipated that the Fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a
price above the devaluation level it anticipates.


EMERGING MARKETS RISK. Investments in securities and instruments traded in
developing or emerging markets or that provide exposure to such securities or
markets can involve additional risks relating to political, economic or
regulatory conditions not associated with investments in U.S. securities and
instruments or investments in more developed international markets. Emerging
market governments may, without prior warning, impose capital controls on the
ability to transfer currency, securities or other assets. The Fund's ability to
access certain developing or emerging markets also may be limited due to a
variety of factors, including currency convertibility issues. Such conditions
may impact the ability of the Fund to buy, sell or otherwise transfer
securities, cause the Fund's returns to differ from those available to domestic
investors, adversely affect the trading market and price for Fund shares, and
cause the Fund to decline in value.


EQUITY SECURITIES RISK. Because the Fund invests in equity securities, the value
of the Fund's shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of its equity
securities. Equity securities prices fluctuate for several reasons, including
changes in investors' perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the
general condition of the relevant stock market, such as market volatility, or
when political or economic events affecting the issuer occur. In addition,
common stock prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates, as
the cost of the capital rises and borrowing costs increase.


EUROPE RISK. Investments in a single region, even though representing a number
of different countries within the region, may be affected by common economic
forces and other factors. The Fund is subject to greater risks of adverse events
which occur in the European region and may experience greater volatility than a
fund that is more broadly diversified geographically. Political or economic
disruptions in European countries, even in countries in which the Fund is not
invested, may adversely affect security values and thus the Fund's holdings. A
significant number of countries in Europe are member states in the European
Union (the "EU"), and the member states no longer control their own monetary
policies by directing independent interest rates for their currencies. In these
member states, the authority to direct monetary policies, including money supply
and official interest rates for the Euro, is exercised by the European Central
Bank. Furthermore, the European sovereign debt crisis has had, and continues to
have, a significant negative impact on the economies of certain European
countries and their future economic outlooks.


FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS RISK. Forward foreign currency
exchange contracts involve certain risks, including the risk of failure of the
counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract and the risk that the
use of forward contracts may not serve as a complete hedge because of an
imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the contracts and the
prices of the currencies hedged. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts may
limit any potential gain that might result should the value of the underlying
currencies increase. In addition, because forward currency exchange contracts
are privately negotiated transactions, there can be no assurance that the Fund
will have flexibility to roll-over a forward currency exchange contract upon its
expiration if it desires to do so. Hedging against a decline in the value of a
currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security
traded in that currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines.


LIQUIDITY RISK. The Fund invests in equity securities that may have limited
liquidity despite being listed on a securities exchange. Equity securities that
are less liquid or that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy,
or to sell, compared to other more liquid or active investments. This liquidity
risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular security, as well as the
size and liquidity of the market for such security. The prices at which the
equity securities are held in the Fund will be adversely affected if trading
markets for the equity securities are limited or absent.


MANAGEMENT RISK. The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an
actively managed portfolio. In managing the Fund's investment portfolio, the
Sub-Advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have
the desired result. There can be no guarantee that the Fund will meet its
investment objective.


MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the
Fund or shares of the Fund in general, may fall in value. Securities are subject
to market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic, political, regulatory
or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in
securities prices. Overall securities values could decline generally or could
underperform other investments.


NEW FUND RISK. The Fund currently has fewer assets than larger funds, and like
other relatively new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the Fund's
market exposure for limited periods of time. This impact may be positive or
negative, depending on the direction of market movement during the period
affected. Also, during the initial invest-up period, the Fund may depart from
its principal investment strategies and invest a larger amount or all of its
assets in cash equivalents or it may hold cash.


NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISK. The Fund is classified as "non-diversified" under the
1940 Act. As a result, the Fund is only limited as to the percentage of its
assets which may be invested in the securities of any one issuer by the


-16-








FIRST TRUST RIVERFRONT DYNAMIC EUROPE ETF (RFEU)





diversification requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The Fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a
limited number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to a
single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these
issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain
issuers.


NON-U.S. SECURITIES RISK. Non-U.S. securities are subject to higher volatility
than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse political, social or
economic developments, restrictions on foreign investment or exchange of
securities, lack of liquidity, currency exchange rates, excessive taxation,
government seizure of assets, different legal or accounting standards, and less
government supervision and regulation of exchanges in foreign countries.


PORTFOLIO TURNOVER RISK. High portfolio turnover may result in the Fund paying
higher levels of transaction costs and generating greater tax liabilities for
shareholders. Portfolio turnover risk may cause the Fund's performance to be
less than expected.


PREFERRED STOCK RISK. Preferred stocks combine some of the characteristics of
both common stocks and bonds. Preferred stocks are typically subordinated to
bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure in terms of
priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit
risk than those debt instruments. Preferred stocks are also subject to credit
risk, interest rate risk and income risk.


REIT INVESTMENT RISK. In addition to risks related to investments in real estate
generally, investing in REITs involves certain other risks related to their
structure and focus, which include, but are not limited to, dependency upon
management skills, limited diversification, the risks of locating and managing
financing for projects, heavy cash flow dependency, possible default by
borrowers, the costs and potential losses of self-liquidation of one or more
holdings, the risk of a possible lack of mortgage funds and associated interest
rate risks, overbuilding, property vacancies, increases in property taxes and
operating expenses, changes in zoning laws, losses due to environmental damages,
changes in neighborhood values and appeal to purchases, the possibility of
failing to maintain exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act and, in many
cases, relatively small market capitalization, which may result in less market
liquidity and greater price volatility. REITs are also subject to the risk that
the real estate market may experience an economic downturn generally, which may
have a material effect on the real estate in which the REITs invest and their
underlying portfolio securities.


SMALLER COMPANIES RISK. The Fund may invest in small- and mid-capitalization
companies. Such companies may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or
economic developments, and their securities may be less liquid and may
experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies as a
result of several factors, including limited trading volumes, products or
financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available
information. Accordingly, such companies are generally subject to greater market
risk than larger, more established companies.

o     Kevin Nicholson, CFA, Portfolio Manager of RIG;


o     Sam Turner, CMT, Portfolio Manager of RIG; and


o     Scott Hays, Portfolio Manager of RIG.


Each of the portfolio managers is primarily and jointly responsible for
the day-to-day management of the Fund and has served in such capacity for
the Fund since February 2016.



PURCHASE AND SALE OF FUND SHARES



The Fund issues and redeems shares on a continuous basis, at net asset value,
only in Creation Units consisting of 50,000 shares. The Fund's Creation Units
are generally issued and redeemed in-kind for securities in which the Fund
invests and, in certain circumstances, for cash, and only to and from
broker-dealers and large institutional investors that have entered into
participation agreements. Individual shares of the Fund may only be purchased
and sold on Nasdaq through a broker-dealer. Shares of the Fund will trade on
Nasdaq at market prices rather than net asset value, which may cause the shares
to trade at a price greater than net asset value (premium) or less than net
asset value (discount).



TAX INFORMATION



The Fund's distributions are taxable and will generally be taxed as ordinary
income or capital gains. Distributions on shares held in a tax-deferred account,
while not immediately taxable, will be subject to tax when the shares are no
longer held in a tax-deferred account.



PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES



If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial
intermediary (such as a bank), First Trust and First Trust Portfolios L.P., the
Fund's distributor, may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and
related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by
influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to
recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your
financial intermediary's website for more information.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FUNDS' INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES



Each Fund is a series of the Trust, an investment company and an actively
managed exchange-traded fund. Each Fund's investment objective is fundamental
and may not be changed without approval by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Unless an investment policy is
identified as being fundamental, all investment policies included in this
prospectus and the Funds' Statement of Additional Information ("SAI") are
non-fundamental and may be changed by the Board of Trustees (the "Board") of
First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund III (the "Trust"), without shareholder
approval. However, each Fund's investment policy adopted pursuant to Rule 35d-1
under the 1940 Act relating to the investment of at least 80% of the Fund's net
assets (including investment borrowings) may be changed by the Board without
shareholder approval only upon 60 days' prior written notice. If there is a
material change to the Fund's principal investment strategies, you should
consider whether the Fund remains an appropriate investment for you.


There is no guarantee that a Fund will achieve its investment objective. During
the initial invest-up period, each Fund may depart from its principal investment
strategies and invest a larger amount or all of its assets in cash or cash
equivalents.



FUND INVESTMENTS




PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS




EQUITY SECURITIES



Each Fund invests in equity securities, which may include common stock and other
securities with equity characteristics, such as real estate investment trusts
("REITs") and depositary receipts.


Common Stock. Common stock represents residual ownership interest in issuers and
holders of common stock are entitled to the income and increase in the value of
the assets and business of the issuers after all debt obligations and
obligations to preferred stockholders are satisfied. Common stockholders
generally have voting rights. Common stock fluctuates in price in response to
many factors including historical and prospective earnings of the issuer, the
value of its assets, general economic conditions, interest rates, investor
perceptions and market liquidity. The value of common stock purchased by each
Fund could decline if the financial condition of the companies the Fund invests
in declines or if overall market and economic conditions deteriorate. Their
value also may decline due to factors that affect a particular industry or
industries, such as labor shortages or an increase in production costs and
competitive conditions within an industry. In addition, they may decline due to
general market conditions that are not specifically related to a company or
industry, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the
general outlook for corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency rates or
generally adverse investor sentiment.


Preferred Stock. Preferred stocks represent an equity ownership interest in the
issuer, but generally entitle the holder to receive, in preference to the
holders of other stocks such as common stocks, dividends and a fixed share of
the proceeds resulting from liquidation of the company. Some preferred stocks
also entitle their holders to receive additional liquidation proceeds on the
same basis as holders of a company's common stock. Some preferred stocks offer a
fixed rate of return with no maturity date. Because those preferred stocks never
mature, they act like long-term bonds, can be more volatile than other types of
preferred stocks and may have heightened sensitivity to changes in interest
rates. Other preferred stocks have a variable dividend, generally determined on
a quarterly or other periodic basis, either according to a formula based upon a
specified premium or discount to the yield on particular U.S. Treasury
securities or based on an auction process, involving bids submitted by holders
and prospective purchasers of such stocks. Because preferred stocks represent an
equity ownership interest in a company, their value usually will react more
strongly than bonds and other debt instruments to actual or perceived changes in
the company's financial condition or prospects or to fluctuations in the equity
markets. Holders of preferred stocks generally have no voting rights or their
voting rights are limited to certain extraordinary transactions or events.


REITs. The Fund may invest in common and preferred shares of REITs. REITs are
financial vehicles that pool investors' capital to purchase or finance real
estate. REITs are generally classified as equity REITs, mortgage REITs or a
combination of equity and mortgage REITs. Equity REITs invest the majority of
their assets directly in real property and derive income primarily from the
collection of rents. Equity REITs can also realize capital gains by selling
properties that have appreciated in value. Mortgage REITs invest the majority of
their assets in real estate mortgages and derive income from the collection of
interest payments. REITs are not taxed on income distributed to shareholders
provided they comply with the applicable tax requirements.


Depositary Receipts. The Funds may make foreign investments through American
Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), European Depositary Receipts ("EDRs") and Global
Depositary Receipts ("GDRs"), or other securities representing underlying shares


-19-





of foreign issuers. Positions in those securities are not necessarily
denominated in the same currency as the underlying shares they represent. ADRs
are receipts typically issued by a U.S. bank or trust company evidencing
ownership of the underlying securities issued by foreign issuers. EDRs are
European receipts listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange evidencing a similar
arrangement. GDRs are U.S. dollar denominated receipts evidencing ownership of
foreign securities. Generally, ADRs, in registered form, are designed for the
U.S. securities markets and EDRs and GDRs, in bearer form, are designed for use
in foreign securities markets. Investments in depositary receipts involve risks
similar to those accompanying direct investments in non-U.S. securities,
including liquidity, currency, political, information and other risks.


Business Development Companies. Business Development Companies ("BDCs") are a
type of closed-end fund regulated under the 1940 Act that typically invest in
and lend to small and medium-sized private and certain public companies that may
not have access to public equity markets for capital raising. BDCs invest in
such diverse industries as healthcare, chemical and manufacturing, technology
and service companies. BDCs are unique in that at least 70% of their investments
must be made in private and certain public U.S. businesses, and BDCs are
required to make available significant managerial assistance to their portfolio
companies. Unlike corporations, BDCs are not taxed on income distributed to
their shareholders provided they comply with the applicable requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. BDCs, which are required to
distribute substantially all of their income to investors in order to not be
subject to entity level taxation, often offer a yield advantage over other types
of securities. A Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any
management and other expenses, and of any performance based or incentive fees,
charged by the BDCs in which it invests, in addition to the expenses paid by the
Fund. The Funds are permitted to invest in BDCs in excess of the limits imposed
under the 1940 Act pursuant to an exemptive order obtained by the Trust and the
Advisor.



CURRENCY HEDGING TRANSACTIONS



In connection with their non-U.S. investments, to protect the value of their
portfolios against uncertainty in the level of future currency exchange rates,
the Funds may enter into foreign currency transactions on a spot (i.e., cash)
basis or may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The Funds
will invest in forward foreign currency exchange contracts for hedging or
currency risk management purposes and not in order to speculate on currency
exchange rate movements, and the amount each Fund may invest in such
transactions depends in part on the extent of the Fund's non-U.S. investments.
As part of such currency hedging transactions, the Fund may shift its exposure
to foreign currency fluctuations from one currency to another. In this regard,
the Fund may use one currency (or a basket of currencies) to hedge against
adverse changes in the value of another currency (or basket of currencies) when
exchange rates between the two currencies are positively correlated. This may
include shifting exposure from a foreign currency to U.S. dollars or from one
foreign currency to another foreign currency.


A forward foreign currency exchange contract is an obligation to purchase or
sell a specific currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days
agreed upon by the parties from the date of the contract, at a price set on the
date of the contract. A forward foreign currency exchange contract may reduce a
Fund's exposure to changes in the value of the currency it will deliver and
increase its exposure to changes in the value of the currency it will receive
for the duration of the contract. The effect on the value of such Fund is
similar to selling securities denominated in one currency and purchasing
securities denominated in another currency. At the maturity of a forward
contract to deliver a particular currency, the Fund may either sell portfolio
securities denominated in such currency and make delivery of the currency, or it
may retain the securities and acquire the currency on the spot market, negotiate
to roll over the contract into a new forward contract with a new future
settlement date or terminate its contractual obligation to deliver the currency
by purchasing an offsetting contract with the same currency trader obligating it
to purchase on the same maturity date the same amount of the currency.


The Funds' currency hedging transactions may involve a Fund transacting in a
currency whose value is expected to correlate to the value of a currency in
which a portfolio security of the Fund is denominated--i.e., such substitute
currency will act as a "proxy" for a currency that the Fund seeks to hedge. The
Sub-Advisor may employ such proxy hedging (as opposed to direct hedging) under
certain circumstances, including when: (i) the currency that it seeks to hedge
is thinly traded or illiquid, (ii) the proxy hedging transaction would be less
expensive than the corresponding direct hedging transaction, and/or (iii) it
would not be efficient or cost effective to transact in the currency that it
seeks to hedge as a result of its limited representation in a Fund's portfolio.
In this regard, the Sub-Advisor has determined: (i) each of the Japanese Yen,
the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar to be representative of, and may
serve as a proxy for, the Taiwanese Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and/or the
Korean Won; (ii) each of the Euro, the British Pound, the Swiss Franc and the
Canadian Dollar to be representative of, and may serve as a proxy for, the
Swedish Krona, the Norwegian Krone, the Danish Krone and/or the Israeli Shekel;

(iii) each of the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar and the Mexican Peso to
be representative of, and may serve as a proxy for, all Latin American
currencies, including Brazil, Chile and Peru; and (iv) the Polish Zloty to be
representative of, and may serve as a proxy for, all Eastern European
currencies, including the Ukraine and the Czech Republic.

NON-U.S. INVESTMENTS



Non-U.S. investments include securities issued or guaranteed by companies
organized under the laws of countries other than the United States, including
companies domiciled in emerging markets. Non-U.S. investments may be traded on
foreign securities exchanges or in over-the-counter capital markets. Many
non-U.S. companies issue both foreign currency and U.S. dollar-denominated
securities.



ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS




CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS



Normally, the Funds invest substantially all of their assets to meet their
objective. Each Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in securities with
maturities of less than one year or cash equivalents, or it may hold cash. The
percentage of a Fund invested in such holdings varies and depends on several
factors, including market conditions. For temporary defensive purposes and
during periods of high cash inflows or outflows, a Fund may depart from its
principal investment strategies and invest part or all of its assets in these
securities or it may hold cash. During such periods, a Fund may not be able to
achieve its investment objective. A Fund may adopt a defensive strategy when the
portfolio managers believe securities in which such Fund normally invests have
elevated risks due to political or economic factors and in other extraordinary
circumstances. For more information on eligible short term investments, see the
SAI.



ILLIQUID SECURITIES



The Funds may invest up to 15% of their net assets in securities and other
instruments that are illiquid (determined using the Securities and Exchange
Commission's standard applicable to investment companies, i.e., securities that
cannot be disposed of by a fund within seven days in the ordinary course of
business at approximately the price at which the fund has valued the
securities).



DISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS



A description of the policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of
the Funds' portfolio securities is included in the Funds' SAI, which is
available on the Funds' website at www.ftportfolios.com.






ADDITIONAL RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUNDS



Risk is inherent in all investing. Investing in a Fund involves risk, including
the risk that you may lose all or part of your investment. There can be no
assurance that a Fund will meet its stated objective. Before you invest, you
should consider the following risks in addition to the Principal Risks set forth
above in this prospectus.






PRINCIPAL RISKS



BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY RISK. The Funds may invest in BDCs which may carry
risks similar to those of a private equity or venture capital fund. Small and
medium-sized companies may have fewer lines of business so that changes in any
one line of business may have a greater impact on the value of their stock than
is the case with a larger company. An investment in BDCs is also subject to
additional risks, including management's ability to meet the fund's investment
objective, and to manage the fund's portfolio when the underlying securities are
redeemed or sold, during periods of market turmoil and as investors' perceptions
regarding the funds or their underlying investments change. BDCs are not
redeemable at the option of the shareholder and they may trade in the market at
a discount to their net asset value.


The BDCs included in the Funds may employ the use of leverage in their
portfolios through borrowings or the issuance of preferred stock. This leverage
also subjects a BDC to increased risks, including the likelihood of increased
volatility and the possibility that a BDC's common share income will fall if the
dividend rate of the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings
rises.


CASH TRANSACTIONS RISK. The Funds may, under certain circumstances, effect a
portion of creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities.
As a result, an investment in the Funds may be less tax-efficient than an
investment in an exchange-traded fund ("ETF") that effects its creations and
redemptions for in-kind securities. ETFs are able to make in-kind redemptions
and avoid being taxed on gains on the distributed portfolio securities at the
fund level. Because the Funds may effect a portion of redemptions for cash, they
may be required to sell portfolio securities in order to obtain the cash needed
to distribute redemption proceeds. Any recognized gain on these sales by the
Funds will generally cause the Funds to recognize gain they might not otherwise
have recognized, or to recognize such gain sooner than would otherwise be
required if they were to distribute portfolio securities in-kind. The Funds
generally intend to distribute these gains to shareholders to avoid being taxed
on this gain at the fund level and otherwise comply with the special tax rules
that apply to them. This strategy may cause shareholders to be subject to tax on
gains they would not otherwise be subject to, or at an earlier date than if they


-21-





had made an investment in a different ETF. Moreover, cash transactions may have
to be carried out over several days if the securities market is relatively
illiquid and may involve considerable brokerage fees and taxes. These brokerage
fees and taxes, which will be higher than if the Funds sold and redeemed their
shares in-kind, will be passed on to purchasers and redeemers of Creation Units
in the form of creation and redemption transaction fees. In addition, these
factors may result in wider spreads between the bid and the offered prices of
the Funds' shares than for ETFs that distribute portfolio securities in-kind.


CURRENCY RISK. An increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other
currencies may cause the value of the Funds to decline. Certain non-U.S.
currencies may be particularly volatile, and non-U.S. governments may intervene
in the currency markets, causing a decline in value or liquidity in the Funds'
non-U.S. holdings whose value is tied to the affected non-U.S. currency.


DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS RISK. Depositary receipts are usually in the form of ADRs or
GDRs. ADRs are U.S. dollar-denominated receipts representing shares of
foreign-based corporations. ADRs are issued by U.S. banks or trust companies,
and entitle the holder to all dividends and capital gains that are paid out on
the underlying foreign shares. GDRs are similar to ADRs, but are shares of
foreign-based corporations generally issued by non-U.S. banks in one or more
markets around the world. ADRs or GDRs may be less liquid than the underlying
shares in their primary trading market. Any distributions paid to the holders of
depositary receipts, whether ADRs or GDRs, are usually subject to a fee charged
by the depositary.


Holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights pursuant to a
deposit agreement between the underlying issuer and the depositary. In certain
cases, the depositary will vote the equity shares deposited with it as directed
by the underlying issuer's board of directors. Furthermore, investment
restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of depositary
receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert the equity
shares into depositary receipts and vice versa. Such restrictions may cause the
equity shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the
market price of the depositary receipt. Moreover, if depositary receipts are
converted into equity shares, the laws in certain countries may limit the
ability of a non-resident to trade the equity shares and to reconvert the equity
shares to depositary receipts.


DYNAMIC HEDGING RISK. At the discretion of the Sub-Advisor, the Funds will
utilize a dynamic currency hedging process through the use of forward foreign
currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions to hedge a portion of
the Funds' currency exposure. The Sub-Advisor will adjust the extent to which
the Funds will utilize currency hedging transactions on an ongoing basis based
on, among other things, market conditions, currency exchange rates and the
currency exposure of the Funds' portfolio investments. As a result of the
dynamic currency hedging process, the portion of a Fund's portfolio securities
which are subject to currency hedging transactions may vary widely, from 0% to
100% of the Fund's portfolio securities. A Fund may have higher returns than an
equivalent non-currency hedged investment when the component currencies are
weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, a Fund may have lower returns
than an equivalent non-currency hedged investment when the component currencies
are rising relative to the U.S. dollar. As such, contracts to sell foreign
currency will generally be expected to limit any potential gain that might be
realized by the Funds if the value of the hedged currency increases. Although
the Funds seek to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns,
the use of currency hedging will not necessarily eliminate exposure to all
currency fluctuations.


Hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate
fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or
prevent a loss if the value of the security declines. Moreover, it may not be
possible for a Fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally
anticipated that the Fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a
price above the devaluation level it anticipates. The cost to a Fund of engaging
in currency exchange transactions varies with such factors as the currency
involved, the length of the contract period and prevailing market conditions.


A proxy hedging transaction entails greater risk than a direct hedging
transaction as it is dependent on a stable relationship between the two
currencies paired as proxies, and that relationship may not always be
maintained.


EMERGING MARKETS RISK. Investments in securities of issuers located in emerging
market countries are considered speculative. Heightened risks of investing in
emerging markets securities include: (i) smaller market capitalization of
securities markets, which may suffer periods of relative illiquidity; (ii)
significant price volatility; (iii) restrictions on foreign investment; and (iv)
possible repatriation of investment income and capital. Furthermore, non-U.S.
investors may be required to register the proceeds of sales and future economic
or political crises could lead to price controls, forced mergers, expropriation
or confiscatory taxation, seizure, nationalization or creation of government
monopolies. The currencies of emerging market countries may experience
significant declines against the U.S. dollar, and devaluation may occur
subsequent to investments in these currencies by the Funds. Inflation and rapid
fluctuations in inflation rates have had, and may continue to have, negative
effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market
countries.


-22-





EQUITY SECURITIES RISK. Equity securities may decline significantly in price
over short or extended periods of time, and such declines may occur in the
equity market as a whole, or they may occur only in a particular country,
company, industry or sector of the market.


ILLIQUID SECURITIES RISK. Illiquid securities may be difficult to dispose of at
the price at which a Fund has valued the securities and at the times when the
Fund believes it is desirable to do so. The market price of illiquid securities
generally is more volatile than that of more liquid securities, which may
adversely affect the price that a Fund recovers upon the sale of such
securities. Illiquid securities are also more difficult to value, especially in
challenging markets. The Sub-Advisor's judgment may play a greater role in the
valuation process. Investment of a Fund's assets in illiquid securities may
restrict the Fund's ability to take advantage of market opportunities. The risks
associated with illiquid securities may be particularly acute in situations in
which a Fund's operations require cash and could result in the Fund incurring
losses on the sale of illiquid or restricted securities.


NON-U.S. SECURITIES RISK. The Funds will invest in securities of non-U.S.
issuers. An investment in securities of non-U.S. issuers involves risks not
associated with domestic issuers. Non-U.S. securities are subject to higher
volatility than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse
political, social or economic developments, restrictions on foreign investment
or exchange of securities, lack of liquidity, currency exchange rates, excessive
taxation, government seizure of assets, different legal or accounting standards,
and less government supervision and regulation of exchanges in non-U.S.
countries. The adoption of new governmental restrictions, including the possible
imposition of withholding taxes on dividend income and the possible
establishment of exchange controls or freezes on the convertibility of currency,
might adversely affect an investment in non-U.S. securities. Investments in
non-U.S. securities also may involve higher costs than investments in U.S.
securities, including higher transaction and custody costs as well as the
imposition of additional taxes by non-U.S. governments. Non-U.S. investments may
also involve risks associated with less complete financial information about the
issuers.


PREFERRED STOCK RISK. An investment in preferred stocks involves the further
risks not associated with an investment in common stocks set forth below:


o     Limited Voting Rights. Generally, holders of preferred stocks (such
as the Fund) have no voting rights with respect to the issuing
company unless preferred dividends have been in arrears for a
specified number of periods, at which time the preferred stock
holders may elect a number of directors to the issuer's board.
Generally, once the issuer pays all the arrearages, the preferred
stock holders no longer have voting rights.


o     Special Redemptions Rights. In certain circumstances, an issuer of
preferred stocks may redeem the securities prior to a specified
date. For instance, for certain types of preferred stocks, a
redemption may be triggered by a change in federal income tax or
securities laws. As with call provisions, a special redemption by
the issuer may negatively impact the return of the security held by
the Fund.


o     Deferral. Preferred stocks may include provisions that permit the
issuer, at its discretion, to defer distributions for a stated
period without any adverse consequences to the issuer. If the Fund
owns a preferred stock that is deferring its distributions, the Fund
may be required to report income for federal income tax purposes
although it has not yet received such income in cash.


o     Subordination. Preferred stocks are subordinated to bonds and other
debt instruments in a company's capital structure in terms of
priority to corporate income and liquidation payments and therefore
will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments.


o     Liquidity. Preferred stocks may be substantially less liquid than
many other securities, such as common stocks or U.S. government
securities.






NON-PRINCIPAL RISKS



AUTHORIZED PARTICIPANT CONCENTRATION RISK. Only an authorized participant (as
defined in the "Frequent Purchases and Redemptions" Section) may engage in
creation or redemption transactions directly with the Funds.


Each Fund has a limited number of institutions that act as authorized
participants. To the extent that these institutions exit the business or are
unable to proceed with creation and/or redemption orders with respect to a Fund
and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem,
in either of these cases, Fund shares may trade at a discount to the Fund's net
asset value and possibly face delisting.


BORROWING AND LEVERAGE RISKS. If a Fund borrows money, it must pay interest and
other fees, which may reduce the Fund's returns. As prescribed by the 1940 Act,
each Fund will be required to maintain specified asset coverage of at least 300%
with respect to any bank borrowing immediately following such borrowing. A Fund


-23-





may be required to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms if market fluctuations
or other factors reduce the Fund's asset coverage to less than the prescribed
amount.


DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL. The Sub-Advisor is dependent upon the experience
and expertise of the Funds' portfolio managers in providing advisory services
with respect to the Funds' investments. If the Sub-Advisor were to lose the
services of any of these portfolio managers, its ability to service the Funds
could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that a suitable
replacement could be found for any of the portfolio managers in the event of
their death, resignation, retirement or inability to act on behalf of the
Sub-Advisor.


INFLATION RISK. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income
from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of
money. As inflation increases, the value of the Funds' assets can decline as can
the value of the Funds' distributions. Certain securities in which the Funds
invest may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates, as the cost of
capital rises and borrowing costs increase.


INTERNATIONAL CLOSED MARKET TRADING RISK. Because securities held by the Funds
trade on non-U.S. exchanges that are closed when the Funds' primary listing
exchange is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of
an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security
(i.e., a Fund's quote from the closed foreign market), resulting in premiums or
discounts to each Fund's net asset value that may be greater than those
experienced by other exchange-traded funds. However, because shares can be
created and redeemed in Creation Units at a Fund's net asset value, it is not
expected that large discounts or premiums to the net asset value of any Fund
will be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds,
which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums
to, their net asset values).


ISSUER SPECIFIC CHANGES RISK. The value of an individual security or particular
type of security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can perform
differently from the value of the market as a whole.


LEGISLATION/LITIGATION RISK. From time to time, various legislative initiatives
are proposed in the United States and abroad, which may have a negative impact
on certain companies in which the Funds invest. Such legislation or litigation
may cause a Fund to lose value or may result in higher portfolio turnover if the
Sub-Advisor determines to sell such a holding.


MARKET MAKER RISK. If a Fund has lower average daily trading volumes, it may
rely on a small number of third-party market makers to provide a market for the
purchase and sale of shares. Any trading halt or other problem relating to the
trading activity of these market makers could result in a dramatic change in the
spread between a Fund's net asset value and the price at which such Fund's
shares are trading on Nasdaq which could result in a decrease in value of the
Fund's shares. In addition, decisions by market makers or authorized
participants to reduce their role or step away from these activities in times of
market stress could inhibit the effectiveness of the arbitrage process in
maintaining the relationship between the underlying values of the Fund's
portfolio securities and the Funds' market price. This reduced effectiveness
could result in Fund shares trading at a discount to net asset value and also in
greater than normal intraday bid-ask spreads for Fund shares.



TRADING ISSUES



Although the shares of each Fund are listed for trading on Nasdaq, there can be
no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be
maintained. Trading in shares on Nasdaq may be halted due to market conditions
or for reasons that, in the view of Nasdaq, make trading in shares inadvisable.
In addition, trading in shares on Nasdaq is subject to trading halts caused by
extraordinary market volatility pursuant to Nasdaq "circuit breaker" rules.
Market makers are under no obligation to make a market in the Fund's shares, and
authorized participants are not obligated to submit purchase or redemption
orders for Creation Units. There can be no assurance that the requirements of
Nasdaq necessary to maintain the listing of a Fund will continue to be met or
will remain unchanged. Initially, due to the small asset size of the Funds, they
may have difficulty maintaining their listing on Nasdaq.






FLUCTUATION OF NET ASSET VALUE



The net asset value of shares of each Fund will generally fluctuate with changes
in the market value of such Fund's holdings. The market prices of shares will
generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in net asset value as well as the
relative supply of and demand for shares on Nasdaq. The Funds cannot predict
whether shares will trade below, at or above their net asset value because the
shares trade on Nasdaq at market prices and not at net asset value. Price
differences may be due, in large part, to the fact that supply and demand forces
at work in the secondary trading market for shares will be closely related to,
but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the holdings of
the Funds trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in time.
However, given that shares can only be purchased and redeemed either in-kind or
for cash in Creation Units, and only to and from broker-dealers and large
institutional investors that have entered into participation agreements (unlike
shares of closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts


-24-





from, and sometimes at premiums to, their net asset value), the Funds believe
that large discounts or premiums to the net asset value of shares should not be
sustained.



FUND ORGANIZATION



Each Fund is a series of the Trust, an investment company registered under
the 1940 Act. Each Fund is treated as a separate fund with its own investment
objective and policies. The Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business
trust. Its Board is responsible for the overall management and direction of the
Trust. The Board elects the Trust's officers and approves all significant
agreements, including those with the investment advisers, custodian and fund
administrative and accounting agent.

MANAGEMENT FEE



Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreements, First Trust supervises
RIG and its management of the investment of the Funds' assets and pays RIG for
its services as the Funds' sub-adviser. First Trust is responsible for each
Fund's expenses, including the cost of transfer agency, sub-advisory, custody,
fund administration, legal, audit and other services, but excluding fee payments
under the Fund's Investment Management Agreement, interest, taxes, brokerage
commissions and other expenses connected with the execution of portfolio
transactions, distribution and service fees pursuant to a 12b-1 plan, if any,
and extraordinary expenses.


Each Fund has agreed to pay First Trust an annual management fee equal to
0.83% of its average daily net assets. As of the date of this prospectus, each
Fund has neither commenced operations nor paid management fees. A discussion
regarding the Board's approval of the Investment Management Agreement and
Sub-Advisory Agreement for each Fund will be available in such Fund's
Semi-Annual Report to Shareholders for the period ended April 30, 2016.






HOW TO BUY AND SELL SHARES



Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Funds in secondary market
transactions through brokers. Shares of the Funds are expected to be listed for
trading on the secondary market on Nasdaq. Shares can be bought and sold
throughout the trading day like other publicly traded shares. There is no
minimum investment when buying shares on Nasdaq. Although shares are generally
purchased and sold in "round lots" of 100 shares, brokerage firms typically
permit investors to purchase or sell shares in smaller "odd lots," at no
per-share price differential. When buying or selling shares through a broker,
investors should expect to incur customary brokerage commissions, investors may
receive less than the net asset value of the shares because shares are bought
and sold at market prices rather than net asset value, and investors may pay
some or all of the spread between the bid and the offer price in the secondary
market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction. Share prices
are reported in dollars and cents per share.


For purposes of the 1940 Act, each Fund is treated as a registered investment
company, and the acquisition of shares by other registered investment companies
is subject to the restrictions of Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. The Trust,
on behalf of the Funds, has received an exemptive order from the Securities and
Exchange Commission that permits certain registered investment companies to
invest in a Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to
certain terms and conditions, including that any such investment companies enter
into an agreement with such Fund regarding the terms of any investment.



BOOK ENTRY



Shares are held in book-entry form, which means that no share certificates are
issued. The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its nominee is the record owner
of all outstanding shares of the Funds and is recognized as the owner of all
shares for all purposes. Investors owning shares are beneficial owners as shown
on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities
depository for all shares. Participants in DTC include securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions
that directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a
beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of
share certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not
considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an
owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants.
These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other stocks that you
hold in book-entry or "street name" form.






SHARE TRADING PRICES



The trading prices of shares of a Fund on Nasdaq may differ from such Fund's
daily net asset value and can be affected by market forces of supply and demand,
economic conditions and other factors.


Information regarding the intra-day value of the shares of a Fund, also referred
to as the "indicative optimized portfolio value" ("IOPV"), is disseminated every
15 seconds throughout such Fund's trading day by the national securities
exchange on which the shares are listed or by market data vendors or other
information providers. The IOPV should not be viewed as a "real-time" update of
the net asset value per share of a Fund because the IOPV may not be calculated
in the same manner as the net asset value, which is computed once a day,
generally at the end of the business day. The price of a non-U.S. security that
is primarily traded on a non-U.S. exchange will be updated, using the last sale
price, every 15 seconds throughout the trading day, provided, that, upon the
closing of such non-U.S. exchange, the closing price of the security, after
being converted to U.S. dollars, will be used. This will likely cause the IOPV
to deviate significantly from the true market value of the portfolio.
Furthermore, in calculating the IOPV of a Fund's shares, exchange rates may be
used throughout the day (9:00 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., Eastern time) that may differ
from those used to calculate the net asset value per share of such Fund and
consequently may result in differences between the net asset value and the IOPV.


-27-





A Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination
of the IOPV of shares of such Fund and such Fund does not make any warranty as
to its accuracy.






FREQUENT PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF THE FUNDS' SHARES



The Funds impose no restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions
("market timing"). In determining not to approve a written, established policy,
the Board evaluated the risks of market timing activities by the Funds'
shareholders. The Board considered that the Funds' shares can only be purchased
and redeemed directly from a Fund in Creation Units by broker-dealers and large
institutional investors that have entered into participation agreements (i.e.,
authorized participants ("APs")) and that the vast majority of trading in the
Funds' shares occurs on the secondary market. Because the secondary market
trades do not involve the Funds directly, it is unlikely those trades would
cause many of the harmful effects of market timing, including dilution,
disruption of portfolio management, increases in the Funds' trading costs and
the realization of capital gains. As the Funds may effect the purchase or
redemption of Creation Units in exchange wholly or partially for cash, the Board
noted that such trades could result in dilution to the Funds and increased
transaction costs, which could negatively impact the Funds' ability to achieve
their investment objective. However, the Board noted that direct trading by APs
is critical to ensuring that the shares trade at or close to net asset value. In
addition, the Funds impose fixed and variable transaction fees on purchases and
redemptions of Creation Units to cover the custodial and other costs incurred by
the Funds in effecting trades. Finally, the Advisor monitors purchase and
redemption orders from APs for patterns of abusive trading. The Funds reserve
the right to reject purchase and redemption orders from APs that the Advisor has
determined may be disruptive to the management of a Fund, or otherwise not in
the Fund's best interests.






DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES



Dividends from net investment income of the Funds, if any, are declared and paid
quarterly by each Fund. Each Fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if
any, to shareholders at least annually.


Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares
only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option
available. Such shares will generally be reinvested by the broker based upon the
market price of those shares and investors may be subject to customary brokerage
commissions charged by the broker.



FEDERAL TAX MATTERS



This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences of
owning shares of the Funds. This section is current as of the date of this
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these
summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a
non-U.S. person, a broker-dealer or other investor with special circumstances.
In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or non-U.S. tax
consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the
Funds. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions set
forth in this section. In addition, counsel to the Funds was not asked to
review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to, the federal income tax
treatment of the assets to be included in the Funds. This may not be sufficient
for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.



FUND STATUS



Each Fund intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company" under the
federal tax laws. If a Fund qualifies as a regulated investment company and
distributes its income as required by the tax law, the Fund generally will not
pay federal income taxes.



DISTRIBUTIONS



The Funds' distributions are generally taxable. After the end of each year, you
will receive a tax statement that separates the distributions of a Fund into two
categories: ordinary income distributions and capital gain dividends. Ordinary
income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate, however, as
further discussed below, certain ordinary income distributions received from the
Fund may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates. Generally, you will treat all
capital gain dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you
have owned your shares.


To determine your actual tax liability for your capital gain dividends, you must
calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering
all of your other taxable transactions, as described below. In addition, the
Funds may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes
and thus will generally not be taxable to you; however, such distributions may


-28-





reduce your tax basis in your shares, which could result in you having to pay
higher taxes in the future when shares are sold, even if you sell the shares at
a loss from your original investment. The tax status of your distributions from
a Fund is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional
shares or receive them in cash. The income from a Fund that you must take into
account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a
deferred sales fee, if any. The tax laws may require you to treat distributions
made to you in January as if you had received them on December 31 of the
previous year.


Income from a Fund may also be subject to a 3.8% "Medicare tax." This tax
generally applies to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income
exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married
couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.



DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION



A corporation that owns shares generally will not be entitled to the dividends
received deduction with respect to many dividends received from a Fund because
the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions
from regulated investment companies. However, certain ordinary income dividends
on shares that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the Funds
from certain corporations may be reported by the Funds as being eligible for the
dividends received deduction.



CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND CERTAIN ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS



If you are an individual, the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net
capital gain is generally 20% for taxpayers in the 39.6% tax bracket, 15% for
taxpayers in the 25%, 28%, 33% and 35% tax brackets and 0% for taxpayers in the
10% and 15% tax brackets. Some capital gain dividends may be taxed at a higher
maximum stated tax rate. Capital gain received from assets held for more than
one year that is considered "unrecaptured section 1250 gain" (which may be the
case, for example, with some capital gains attributable to equity interests in
real estate investment trusts that constitute interests in entities treated as
real estate investment trusts for federal income tax purposes) is taxed at a
maximum marginal stated federal tax rate of 25%. In the case of capital gain
dividends, the determination of which portion of the capital gain dividend, if
any, is subject to the 25% tax rate, will be made based on rules prescribed by
the United States Treasury. Capital gains may also be subject to the Medicare
tax described above.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term capital
loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the holding
period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the holding
period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you purchase
your shares to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a capital
gain dividend from a Fund and sell your shares at a loss after holding it for
six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital loss
to the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, treats
certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.


Ordinary income dividends received by an individual shareholder from a regulated
investment company such as the Funds are generally taxed at the same rates that
apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain holding period
requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to
qualifying dividends received by the Funds themselves. Dividends from REITs and
foreign corporations are qualifying dividends only in limited circumstances.
Each Fund will provide notice to its shareholders of the amount of any
distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for
the capital gains tax rates.



SALE OF SHARES



If you sell or redeem your shares, you will generally recognize a taxable gain
or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your
tax basis in your shares from the amount you receive in the transaction. Your
tax basis in your shares is generally equal to the cost of your shares,
generally including sales charges. In some cases, however, you may have to
adjust your tax basis after you purchase your shares.






TAXES ON PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS



If you exchange securities for Creation Units you will generally recognize a
gain or a loss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the
market value of the Creation Units at the time and your aggregate basis in the
securities surrendered and the cash component paid. If you exchange Creation
Units for securities, you will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the
difference between your basis in the Creation Units and the aggregate market
value of the securities received and the cash redemption amount. The Internal
Revenue Service, however, may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of
securities for Creation Units or Creation Units for securities cannot be
deducted currently under the rules governing "wash sales," or on the basis that
there has been no significant change in economic position.


-29-









DEDUCTIBILITY OF FUND EXPENSES



Expenses incurred and deducted by the Funds will generally not be treated as
income taxable to you. In some cases, however, you may be required to treat your
portion of these Fund expenses as income. In these cases, you may be able to
take a deduction for these expenses. However, certain miscellaneous itemized
deductions, such as investment expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to
the extent that all of these deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted
gross income. Some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the
amount of their itemized deductions, depending on their income.



NON-U.S. TAX CREDIT



Because the Funds invest in non-U.S. securities, the tax statement that you
receive may include an item showing non-U.S. taxes a Fund paid to other
countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your share of the
taxes such Fund paid to other countries. You may be able to deduct or receive a
tax credit for your share of these taxes.



NON-U.S. INVESTORS



If you are a non-U.S. investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or
resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you should be
aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties, distributions from a
Fund will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes (other
than dividends which a Fund properly reports as capital gain dividends) and will
be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, subject to
certain exceptions described below. However, distributions received by a
non-U.S. investor from a Fund that are properly reported by such Fund as capital
gain dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including
withholding taxes, provided that the Fund makes certain elections and certain
other conditions are met.


Distributions may be subject to a U.S. withholding tax of 30% in the case of
distributions to (i) certain non-U.S. financial institutions that have not
entered into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to collect and disclose certain
information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an
agreement with the U.S. Treasury and (ii) certain other non-U.S. entities that
do not provide certain certifications and information about the entity's U.S.
owners. Dispositions of shares by such persons may be subject to such
withholding after December 31, 2018.



INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. CORPORATIONS



If a Fund holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies
("PFICs"), which are generally certain non-U.S. corporations that receive at
least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as interest,
dividends, certain rents and royalties or capital gains) or that hold at least
50% of their assets in investments producing such passive income, the Fund could
be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains
and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests, even if all
the income or gain is timely distributed to its shareholders. A Fund will not be
able to pass through to its shareholders any credit or deduction for such taxes.
A Fund may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax
consequences. In this case, the Fund would recognize as ordinary income any
increase in the value of such PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in
such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income.
Under this election, the Fund might be required to recognize in a year income in
excess of its distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of
PFIC stock during that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to
the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the
4% excise tax. Dividends paid by PFICs are not treated as qualified dividend
income.



DISTRIBUTION PLAN



FTP serves as the distributor of Creation Units for the Funds on an agency
basis. FTP does not maintain a secondary market in shares.


The Board has adopted a Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to Rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act. In accordance with its Rule 12b-1 plan, the Funds are
authorized to pay an amount up to 0.25% of their average daily net assets each
year to reimburse FTP for amounts expended to finance activities primarily
intended to result in the sale of Creation Units or the provision of investor
services. FTP may also use this amount to compensate securities dealers or other
persons that are APs for providing distribution assistance, including
broker-dealer and shareholder support and educational and promotional services.


The Funds do not currently pay 12b-1 fees, and pursuant to a contractual
arrangement, the Funds will not pay 12b-1 fees anytime before February 4, 2018.
However, in the event 12b-1 fees are charged in the future, because these fees
are paid out of the Funds' assets, over time these fees will increase the cost
of your investment and may cost you more than certain other types of sales
charges.


-30-









NET ASSET VALUE



Each Fund's net asset value is determined as of the close of trading (normally
4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on each day
the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a valuation day, each
Fund's net asset value will be determined as of that time. Net asset value per
share is calculated for a Fund by taking the market price of the Fund's total
assets, including interest or dividends accrued but not yet collected, less all
liabilities, and dividing such amount by the total number of shares outstanding.
The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the net asset value per share. All
valuations are subject to review by the Board or its delegate.


Each Fund's investments are valued daily at market or, in the absence of market
value with respect to any investments, at fair value. Market value prices
represent last sale or official closing prices from a national or foreign
exchange (i.e., a regulated market) and are primarily obtained from third party
pricing services ("Pricing Services"). Fair value prices represent any prices
not considered market value prices and are either obtained from a Pricing
Service or determined by the Advisor's pricing committee (the "Pricing
Committee"), in accordance with valuation procedures (which may be revised from
time to time) adopted by the Board, and in accordance with provisions of the
1940 Act. As a general principle, the current "fair value" of a security would
appear to be the amount which the owner might reasonably expect to receive for
the security upon its current sale. Valuing a Fund's assets using fair value
pricing can result in using prices for those assets (particularly assets that
trade in foreign markets) that may differ from current market valuations.


Equity securities listed on any exchange other than Nasdaq and the London Stock
Exchange Alternative Investment Market ("AIM") are typically valued at the last
sale price on the exchange on which they are principally traded. Such securities
listed on Nasdaq or the AIM are typically valued at the official closing price
on the business day as of which such value is being determined. If there has
been no sale on such day, or no official closing price in the case of securities
traded on Nasdaq or the AIM, such securities are typically valued using fair
value pricing. Such securities traded on more than one securities exchange are
valued at the last sale price or official closing price, as applicable, on the
business day as of which such value is being determined at the close of the
exchange representing the principal market for such securities.


Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are typically fair valued at the
current day's interpolated foreign exchange rate, as calculated using the
current day's spot rate, and the thirty, sixty, ninety and one-hundred-eighty
day forward rates provided by a Pricing Service or by certain independent
dealers in such contracts. Currency spot transactions also will typically be
valued using information provided by a Pricing Service.


Because foreign securities exchanges may be open on different days than the days
during which an investor may purchase or sell shares of a Fund, the value of
such Fund's securities may change on days when investors are not able to
purchase or sell shares of the Fund. Assets denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of such currencies against
the U.S. dollar as provided by a Pricing Service. The value of assets
denominated in foreign currencies is converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange
rates in effect at the time of valuation.

OTHER INFORMATION




CONTINUOUS OFFERING



Each Fund will issue, on a continuous offering basis, its shares in one or more
groups of a fixed number of Fund shares (each such group of such specified
number of individual Fund shares, a "Creation Unit Aggregation"). The method by
which Creation Unit Aggregations of Fund shares are created and traded may raise
certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Unit
Aggregations of shares are issued and sold by a Fund on an ongoing basis, a
"distribution," as such term is used in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "1933 Act"), may occur at any point. Broker-dealers and other persons are
cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a
manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.


For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory
underwriter if it takes Creation Unit Aggregations after placing an order with
FTP, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to
customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares
with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand
for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the
1933 Act must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to
the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and
the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of
all the activities that could lead to a characterization as an underwriter.


Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not "underwriters" but
are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the
distribution of shares, are generally required to deliver a prospectus. This is
because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is
not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of
the 1940 Act. As a result, broker-dealer firms should note that dealers who are
not underwriters but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted with
ordinary secondary market transactions) and thus dealing with the shares that
are part of an overallotment within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption
provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus
delivery obligation with respect to shares are reminded that, under Rule 153 of
the 1933 Act ("Rule 153"), a prospectus delivery obligation under Section
5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to a broker-dealer in connection with a sale on
Nasdaq is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available from Nasdaq
upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is
available with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange, a
trading facility or an alternative trading system.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST AND THE FUNDS



The Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on January 9,
2008, and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares in one or more
series or funds. The Trust is an open-end management investment company,
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
Act"). Currently, eight series of the Trust are authorized and outstanding,
comprised of First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Asia Pacific ETF, First Trust
RiverFront Dynamic Developed International ETF, First Trust RiverFront Dynamic
Emerging Markets ETF, First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Europe ETF, First Trust
Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond ETF, First Trust Long/Short Equity ETF,
First Trust Managed Municipal ETF and First Trust Preferred Securities ETF, each
a non-diversified series.


This SAI relates to all of the Funds. Each Fund, as a series of the Trust,
represents a beneficial interest in a separate portfolio of securities and other
assets, with its own objective and policies.


The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the "Board of Trustees" or the
"Trustees") has the right to establish additional series in the future, to
determine the preferences, voting powers, rights and privileges thereof and to
modify such preferences, voting powers, rights and privileges without
shareholder approval. Shares of any series may also be divided into one or more
classes at the discretion of the Trustees.


The Trust or any series or class thereof may be terminated at any time by
the Board of Trustees upon written notice to the shareholders.


Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which a shareholder
vote is required, consistent with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder. Shares of all series of the Trust vote together as a
single class except as otherwise required by the 1940 Act, or if the matter
being voted on affects only a particular series, and, if a matter affects a
particular series differently from other series, the shares of that series will
vote separately on such matter. The Trust's Declaration of Trust (the
"Declaration") requires a shareholder vote only on those matters where the 1940
Act requires a vote of shareholders and otherwise permits the Trustees to take
actions without seeking the consent of shareholders. For example, the
Declaration gives the Trustees broad authority to approve reorganizations
between a Fund and another entity, such as another exchange-traded fund, or the
sale of all or substantially all of a Fund's assets, or the termination of the
Trust or any Fund without shareholder approval if the 1940 Act would not require
such approval.


The Declaration provides that by becoming a shareholder of a Fund, each
shareholder shall be expressly held to have agreed to be bound by the provisions
of the Declaration. The Declaration may, except in limited circumstances, be
amended by the Trustees in any respect without a shareholder vote. The
Declaration provides that the Trustees may establish the number of Trustees and
that vacancies on the Board of Trustees may be filled by the remaining Trustees,
except when election of Trustees by the shareholders is required under the 1940
Act. Trustees are then elected by a plurality of votes cast by shareholders at a
meeting at which a quorum is present. The Declaration also provides that
Trustees may be removed, with or without cause, by a vote of shareholders





holding at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Trust, or by a vote of
two-thirds of the remaining Trustees. The provisions of the Declaration relating
to the election and removal of Trustees may not be amended without the approval
of two-thirds of the Trustees.


The holders of Fund shares are required to disclose information on direct
or indirect ownership of Fund shares as may be required to comply with various
laws applicable to the Funds or as the Trustees may determine, and ownership of
Fund shares may be disclosed by the Funds if so required by law or regulation.
In addition, pursuant to the Declaration, the Trustees may, in their discretion,
require the Trust to redeem shares held by any shareholder for any reason under
terms set by the Trustees. The Declaration provides a detailed process for the
bringing of derivative actions by shareholders in order to permit legitimate
inquiries and claims while avoiding the time, expense, distraction and other
harm that can be caused to a Fund or its shareholders as a result of spurious
shareholder demands and derivative actions. Prior to bringing a derivative
action, a demand must first be made on the Trustees. The Declaration details
various information, certifications, undertakings and acknowledgements that must
be included in the demand. Following receipt of the demand, the Trustees have a
period of 90 days, which may be extended by an additional 60 days, to consider
the demand. If a majority of the Trustees who are considered independent for the
purposes of considering the demand determine that maintaining the suit would not
be in the best interests of a Fund, the Trustees are required to reject the
demand and the complaining shareholder may not proceed with the derivative
action unless the shareholder is able to sustain the burden of proof to a court
that the decision of the Trustees not to pursue the requested action was not a
good faith exercise of their business judgment on behalf of a Fund. In making
such a determination, a Trustee is not considered to have a personal financial
interest by virtue of being compensated for his or her services as a Trustee. If
a demand is rejected, the complaining shareholder will be responsible for the
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Fund in connection
with the consideration of the demand under a number of circumstances. If a
derivative action is brought in violation of the Declaration, the shareholder
bringing the action may be responsible for a Fund's costs, including attorneys'
fees. The Declaration also provides that any shareholder bringing an action
against a Fund waives the right to trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted
by law.


The Trust is not required to and does not intend to hold annual meetings
of shareholders.


Under Massachusetts law applicable to Massachusetts business trusts,
shareholders of such a trust may, under certain circumstances, be held
personally liable as partners for its obligations. However, the Declaration
contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for acts or obligations
of the Trust and requires that notice of this disclaimer be given in each
agreement, obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the Trust or the
Trustees. The Declaration further provides for indemnification out of the assets
and property of the Trust for all losses and expenses of any shareholder held
personally liable for the obligations of the Trust. Thus, the risk of a
shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is
limited to circumstances in which both inadequate insurance existed and the
Trust or the Fund itself was unable to meet its obligations.


The Declaration further provides that a Trustee acting in his or her
capacity as Trustee is not personally liable to any person other than the Trust
or its shareholders, for any act, omission, or obligation of the Trust. The


-2-





Declaration requires the Trust to indemnify any persons who are or who have been
Trustees, officers or employees of the Trust for any liability for actions or
failure to act except to the extent prohibited by applicable federal law. In
making any determination as to whether any person is entitled to the advancement
of expenses in connection with a claim for which indemnification is sought, such
person is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that he or she did not engage in
conduct for which indemnification is not available. The Declaration provides
that any Trustee who serves as chair of the Board of Trustees or of a committee
of the Board of Trustees, as lead independent Trustee or as audit committee
financial expert, or in any other similar capacity, will not be subject to any
greater standard of care or liability because of such position.


The Funds are advised by First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Advisor" or
"First Trust") and sub-advised by RiverFront Investment Group, LLC (the
"Sub-Advisor" or "RIG").


The shares of each Fund list and principally trade on The Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC ("Nasdaq" or the "Exchange"). The shares of each Fund will trade on
the Exchange at market prices that may be below, at or above net asset value.
Each Fund offers and issues shares at net asset value only in aggregations of a
specified number of shares (each, a "Creation Unit" or a "Creation Unit
Aggregation"), generally in exchange for a basket of securities (the "Deposit
Securities"), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the "Cash
Component"), or for cash as specified in the Prospectus. Creation Units are
aggregations of 50,000 shares of a Fund.


The Trust reserves the right to permit creations and redemptions of Fund
shares to be made in whole or in part on a cash basis under certain
circumstances. Fund shares may be issued in advance of receipt of Deposit
Securities subject to various conditions including a requirement to maintain on
deposit with the applicable Fund cash at least equal to 115% of the market value
of the missing Deposit Securities. See the section entitled "Creation and
Redemption of Creation Unit Aggregations." In each instance of such cash
creations or redemptions, transaction fees may be imposed that will be higher
than the transaction fees associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In
all cases, such fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") applicable to management
investment companies offering redeemable securities.



EXCHANGE LISTING AND TRADING



There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary
to maintain the listing of shares of a Fund will continue to be met. The
Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing
if (i) following the initial 12-month period beginning at the commencement of
trading of a Fund, there are fewer than 50 beneficial owners of the shares of
such Fund for 30 or more consecutive trading days or (ii) such other event shall
occur or condition exist that, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes further
dealings on the Exchange inadvisable. The Exchange will remove the shares of the
Fund from listing and trading upon termination of such Fund.


-3-





As in the case of other stocks traded on the Exchange, brokers'
commissions on transactions will be based on negotiated commission rates at
customary levels.


The Funds reserve the right to adjust the price levels of shares in the
future to help maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments
would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would
have no effect on the net assets of each Fund.





INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES



The Prospectus describes the investment objectives and certain policies of
the Funds. The following supplements the information contained in the Prospectus
concerning the investment objectives and policies of the Funds.


Each Fund is subject to the following fundamental policies, which may not
be changed without approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
voting securities (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act) of a Fund:


(1) A Fund may not issue senior securities, except as permitted
under the 1940 Act.


(2) A Fund may not borrow money, except as permitted under the 1940
Act.


(3) A Fund will not underwrite the securities of other issuers
except to the extent a Fund may be considered an underwriter under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), in connection with
the purchase and sale of portfolio securities.


(4) A Fund will not purchase or sell real estate or interests
therein, unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other
instruments (but this shall not prohibit a Fund from purchasing or selling
securities or other instruments backed by real estate or of issuers
engaged in real estate activities).


(5) A Fund may not make loans to other persons, except through (i)
the purchase of debt securities permissible under the Fund's investment
policies, (ii) repurchase agreements, or (iii) the lending of portfolio
securities, provided that no such loan of portfolio securities may be made
by the Fund if, as a result, the aggregate of such loans would exceed
33-1/3% of the value of the Fund's total assets.


(6) A Fund may not purchase or sell physical commodities unless
acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments (but
this shall not prevent the Fund from purchasing or selling options,
futures contracts, forward contracts or other derivative instruments, or
from investing in securities or other instruments backed by physical
commodities).


-4-





(7) A Fund may not invest 25% or more of the value of its total
assets in securities of issuers in any one industry or group of
industries. This restriction does not apply to obligations issued or
guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, or
securities of other investment companies.


For purposes of applying restriction (1) above, under the 1940 Act as
currently in effect, the Funds are not permitted to issue senior securities,
except that a Fund may borrow from any bank if immediately after such borrowing
the value of such Fund's total assets is at least 300% of the principal amount
of all of the Fund's borrowings (i.e., the principal amount of the borrowings
may not exceed 33 1/3% of a Fund's total assets). In the event that such asset
coverage shall at any time fall below 300% the applicable Fund shall, within
three days thereafter (not including Sundays and holidays), reduce the amount of
its borrowings to an extent that the asset coverage of such borrowing shall be
at least 300%.


Except for restriction (2) above, if a percentage restriction is adhered
to at the time of investment, a later increase in percentage resulting from a
change in market value of the investment or the total assets will not constitute
a violation of that restriction. With respect to restriction (2), if the
limitations are exceeded as a result of a change in market value then the Fund
will reduce the amount of borrowings within three days thereafter to the extent
necessary to comply with the limitations (not including Sundays and holidays).


The fundamental investment limitations set forth above limit the Funds'
ability to engage in certain investment practices and purchase securities or
other instruments to the extent permitted by, or consistent with, applicable
law. As such, these limitations will change as the statute, rules, regulations
or orders (or, if applicable, interpretations) change, and no shareholder vote
will be required or sought.


The Funds' investment objectives and the foregoing fundamental policies of
each Fund may not be changed without the affirmative vote of the majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the respective Fund. The 1940 Act defines a
majority vote as the vote of the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting
securities represented at a meeting at which more than 50% of the outstanding
securities are represented; or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting
securities. With respect to the submission of a change in an investment policy
to the holders of outstanding voting securities of a Fund, such matter shall be
deemed to have been effectively acted upon with respect to a Fund if a majority
of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund vote for the approval of such
matter, notwithstanding that such matter has not been approved by the holders of
a majority of the outstanding voting securities of any other series of the Trust
affected by such matter.


In addition to the foregoing fundamental policies, the Funds are also
subject to strategies and policies discussed herein which, unless otherwise
noted, are non-fundamental restrictions and policies and may be changed by the
Board of Trustees.

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



Under normal market conditions, First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Asia
Pacific ETF will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least
80% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in a portfolio of equity
securities of Asian Pacific companies, including through investments in common
stock, depositary receipts, and common and preferred shares of real estate
investment trusts ("REITs"), and forward foreign currency exchange contracts and
currency spot transactions used to hedge the Fund's exposure to the currencies
in which the equity securities of such Asian Pacific companies are denominated.
Fund shareholders are entitled to 60 days' notice prior to any change in this
non-fundamental investment policy.


Under normal market conditions, First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Developed
International ETF will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at
least 80% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in a portfolio of
equity securities of developed market companies, including through investments
in common stock, depositary receipts, and common and preferred shares of REITs,
and forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions
used to hedge the Fund's exposure to the currencies in which the equity
securities of such developed market companies are denominated. Fund shareholders
are entitled to 60 days' notice prior to any change in this non-fundamental
investment policy.


Under normal market conditions, First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Europe ETF
will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its
net assets (including investment borrowings) in a portfolio of equity securities
of European companies, including through investments in common stock, depositary
receipts, and common and preferred shares of REITs, and forward foreign currency
exchange contracts and currency spot transactions used to hedge the Fund's
exposure to the currencies in which the equity securities of such European
companies are denominated. Fund shareholders are entitled to 60 days' notice
prior to any change in this non-fundamental investment policy.



TYPES OF INVESTMENTS



The following information supplements the discussion in the Fund's
Prospectus and reflects certain investments in which the Fund may invest. For
further discussion of the investments in which the Fund may principally invest,
see the Prospectus.


Depositary Receipts: The Funds may hold securities of certain non-U.S.
companies in the form of depositary receipts ("Depositary Receipts"). Depositary
Receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the
underlying securities into which they may be converted. American Depositary
Receipts ("ADRs") are receipts typically issued by an American bank or trust
company that evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign
corporation. European Depositary Receipts ("EDRs") are receipts issued by a
European bank or trust company evidencing ownership of securities issued by a
foreign corporation. Global Depositary Receipts ("GDRs") are receipts issued
throughout the world that evidence a similar arrangement. In addition, the Funds
may invest in New York shares, which are typically issued by a company
incorporated in the Netherlands and represent a direct interest in the company,
and global shares, which are the actual (ordinary) shares of a non-U.S. company


-6-





which trade both in the home market and the United States. Unlike traditional
Depositary Receipts, New York share programs do not involve custody of the Dutch
shares of the company. Generally, ADRs and New York shares, in registered form,
are designed for use in the U.S. securities markets. EDRs, in registered form,
are used to access European markets. GDRs, in registered form, are tradable both
in the United States and in Europe and are designed for use throughout the
world. Global shares are represented by the same share certificate in the United
States and the home market. Separate registrars in the United States and the
home country are maintained. In most cases, purchases occurring on a U.S.
exchange would be reflected on the U.S. registrar. Global shares may also be
eligible to list on exchanges in addition to the United States and the home
country.


Equities: The Funds intend to invest in equity securities, which represent
an ownership position in a company. The prices of equity securities fluctuate
based on, among other things, events specific to their issuers and market,
economic, and other conditions. Equity securities in which the Funds invest
include common stocks. Common stocks may be common stock of any class or series
of a domestic or foreign corporation or any similar equity interest, such as a
trust or partnership interest. These investments may or may not pay dividends
and may or may not carry voting rights. Common stock occupies the most junior
position in a company's capital structure. The Funds may also invest in warrants
and rights related to common stocks.


Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts: To protect the value of their
portfolio against uncertainty in the level of future currency exchange rates
between a particular foreign currency and the U.S. dollar or between foreign
currencies, the Funds may enter into foreign currency transactions on a spot
(i.e., cash) basis or it may enter into forward foreign currency exchange
contracts. A forward foreign currency exchange contract is an obligation to
purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may be any fixed
number of days agreed upon by the parties from the date of the contract at a
price set on the date of the contract. Forward foreign currency exchange
contracts (i) are traded in a market conducted directly between currency traders
(typically, commercial banks or other financial institutions) and their
customers, (ii) generally have no deposit requirements and (iii) are typically
consummated without payment of any commissions. A Fund, however, may enter into
forward foreign currency exchange contracts requiring deposits or involving the
payment of commissions. The Funds will only enter into forward foreign currency
exchange contracts with parties which it believes to be creditworthy
institutions. To assure that its forward foreign currency exchange contracts are
not used to achieve investment leverage, the Funds will segregate or earmark on
its records liquid assets to the extent required under the 1940 Act.


Futures Contracts: The Funds may enter into exchange-listed equity index
futures contracts. A futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to
which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to
the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading
day of the contract and the price at which the index contract was originally
written. Although the value of a securities index is a function of the value of
certain specified securities, no physical delivery of those securities is made.
A public market exists in futures contracts covering a number of indexes
(including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the Russell
2000 Index, the Value Line Composite Index, and the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index). The Funds will not enter into futures contracts which are


-7-





prohibited under the CEA and will, to the extent required by regulatory
authorities, enter only into futures contracts that are traded on national
futures exchanges and are standardized as to maturity date and underlying
financial instrument. Futures exchanges and trading are regulated under the CEA
by the CFTC.


Futures contracts may be closed out prior to delivery by entering into an
offsetting transaction in a matching futures contract. If the offsetting
purchase price is less than the original sale price, a gain will be realized.
Conversely, if the offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase
price, a gain will be realized; if it is less, a loss will be realized. The
transaction costs must also be included in these calculations. There can be no
assurance, however, that a Fund will be able to enter into an offsetting
transaction with respect to a particular futures contract at a particular time.
If a Fund is not able to enter into an offsetting transaction, the Fund will
continue to be required to maintain the margin deposits on the futures contract.


Transaction costs are incurred when a futures contract is bought or sold
and margin deposits must be maintained. Margin is the amount of funds that must
be deposited by a Fund with its custodian in a segregated account in the name of
the futures commission merchant in order to initiate futures trading and to
maintain the Fund's open positions in futures contracts. A margin deposit is
intended to ensure a Fund's performance of the futures contract. The margin
required for a particular futures contract is set by the exchange on which the
futures contract is traded and may be significantly modified from time to time
by the exchange during the term of the futures contract. Futures contracts are
customarily purchased and sold on margins that may range upward from less than
5% of the value of the futures contract being traded.


If the price of an open futures contract changes (by increase in the case
of a sale or by decrease in the case of a purchase) so that the loss on the
futures contract reaches a point at which the margin on deposit does not satisfy
margin requirements, the broker will require an increase in the margin. However,
if the value of a position increases because of favorable price changes in the
futures contract so that the margin deposit exceeds the required margin, the
broker will pay the excess to a Fund. In computing daily net asset value, a Fund
will mark to market the current value of its open futures contracts. The Funds
expect to earn interest income on their margin deposits.


Because of the low margin deposits required, futures trading involves an
extremely high degree of leverage. As a result, a relatively small price
movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss, as
well as gain, to the investor. For example, if at the time of purchase, 10% of
the value of the futures contract is deposited as margin, a subsequent 10%
decrease in the value of the futures contract would result in a total loss of
the margin deposit, before any deduction for the transaction costs, if the
account were then closed out. A 15% decrease would result in a loss equal to
150% of the original margin deposit, if the future contracts were closed out.
Thus, a purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses in excess of
the amount initially invested in the futures contract. However, a Fund would
presumably have sustained comparable losses if, instead of the futures contract,
it had invested in the underlying financial instrument and sold it after the
decline.


-8-





Most U.S. futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in
futures contract prices during a single trading day. The day limit establishes
the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or
down from the previous day's settlement price at the end of a trading session.
Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of futures contract,
no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. The daily limit
governs only price movement during a particular trading day and therefore does
not limit potential losses, because the limit may prevent the liquidation of
unfavorable positions. Futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the
daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading,
thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting some
investors to substantial losses.


There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when a
Fund seeks to close out a futures position. A Fund would continue to be required
to meet margin requirements until the position is closed, possibly resulting in
a decline in the Fund's net asset value. There can be no assurance that an
active secondary market will develop or continue to exist.


The Funds will comply with the applicable regulatory requirements of the
SEC and the CFTC with respect to coverage of futures positions by registered
investment companies and, if the guidelines so require, will earmark or set
aside cash, U.S. government securities, high grade liquid debt securities and/or
other liquid assets permitted by the SEC and CFTC in a segregated custodial
account in the amount prescribed or as may be held by the futures commission
merchant or other applicable entity as permitted under the 1940 Act. Securities
earmarked or held in a segregated account cannot be sold while the futures
position is outstanding, unless replaced with other permissible assets, and will
be marked-to-market daily.


Illiquid Securities: The Funds may invest in illiquid securities (i.e.,
securities that are not readily marketable). For purposes of this restriction,
illiquid securities include, but are not limited to, restricted securities
(securities the disposition of which is restricted under the federal securities
laws), securities that may only be resold pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933
Act but that are deemed to be illiquid, and repurchase agreements with
maturities in excess of seven days. A Fund will not acquire illiquid securities
if, as a result, such securities would comprise more than 15% of the value of
the Fund's net assets. The Board of Trustees or its delegate has the ultimate
authority to determine, to the extent permissible under the federal securities
laws, which securities are liquid or illiquid for purposes of this 15%
limitation. The Board of Trustees has delegated to the Sub-Advisor the
day-to-day determination of the illiquidity of any security, although it has
retained oversight for such determinations. With respect to Rule 144A
securities, the factors considered in such a determination may include (i) the
nature of the market for a security (including the institutional private resale
market), the frequency of trades and quotes for the security, the number of
dealers willing to purchase or sell the security, the amount of time normally
needed to dispose of the security, the method of soliciting offers and the
mechanics of transfer), (ii) the terms of certain securities or other
instruments allowing for the disposition to a third party or the issuer thereof
(e.g., certain repurchase obligations and demand instruments), and (iii) other
permissible relevant factors.


Restricted securities may be sold only in privately negotiated
transactions or in a public offering with respect to which a registration
statement is in effect under the 1933 Act. Where registration is required, a


-9-





Fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a
considerable period may elapse between the time of the decision to sell and the
time a Fund may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration
statement. If, during such a period, adverse market conditions were to develop,
a Fund might obtain a less favorable price than that which prevailed when it
decided to sell. Illiquid securities will be priced at fair value as determined
in good faith under procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. If, through the
appreciation of illiquid securities or the depreciation of liquid securities, a
Fund should be in a position where more than 15% of the value of its net assets
are invested in illiquid securities, including restricted securities which are
not readily marketable, a Fund will take such steps as is deemed advisable, if
any, to protect liquidity.


Fixed Income Investments and Cash Equivalents: Normally, the Funds invest
substantially all of their assets to meet their investment objectives. However,
for temporary or defensive purposes, the Funds may invest in fixed income
investments and cash equivalents in order to provide income, liquidity and
preserve capital.


Fixed income investments and cash equivalents held by each Fund may
include, without limitation, the types of investments set forth below:


(1) A Fund may invest in U.S. government securities, including
bills, notes and bonds differing as to maturity and rates of interest,
which are either issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by U.S.
government agencies or instrumentalities. U.S. government securities
include securities that are issued or guaranteed by the United States
Treasury, by various agencies of the U.S. government, or by various
instrumentalities that have been established or sponsored by the U.S.
government. U.S. Treasury securities are backed by the "full faith and
credit" of the United States. Securities issued or guaranteed by federal
agencies and U.S. government-sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Some of the U.S.
government agencies that issue or guarantee securities include the
Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Farmers Home Administration,
the Federal Housing Administration, the Maritime Administration, the Small
Business Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority. An
instrumentality of the U.S. government is a government agency organized
under federal charter with government supervision. Instrumentalities
issuing or guaranteeing securities include, among others, the Federal Home
Loan Banks, the Federal Land Banks, the Central Bank for Cooperatives,
Federal Intermediate Credit Banks and Federal National Mortgage
Association ("FNMA"). In the case of those U.S. government securities not
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, the investor
must look principally to the agency or instrumentality issuing or
guaranteeing the security for ultimate repayment, and may not be able to
assert a claim against the United States itself in the event that the
agency or instrumentality does not meet its commitment. The U.S.
government, its agencies and instrumentalities do not guarantee the market
value of their securities; consequently, the value of such securities may
fluctuate. In addition, each Fund may invest in sovereign debt obligations
of non-U.S. countries. A sovereign debtor's willingness or ability to
repay principal and interest in a timely manner may be affected by a
number of factors, including its cash flow situation, the extent of its


-10-





non-U.S. reserves, the availability of sufficient non-U.S. exchange on the
date a payment is due, the relative size of the debt service burden to the
economy as a whole, the sovereign debtor's policy toward principal
international lenders and the political constraints to which it may be
subject.


(2) A Fund may invest in certificates of deposit issued against
funds deposited in a bank or savings and loan association. Such
certificates are for a definite period of time, earn a specified rate of
return, and are normally negotiable. If such certificates of deposit are
non-negotiable, they will be considered illiquid securities and be subject
to a Fund's 15% restriction on investments in illiquid securities.
Pursuant to the certificate of deposit, the issuer agrees to pay the
amount deposited plus interest to the bearer of the certificate on the
date specified thereon. Under current FDIC regulations, the maximum
insurance payable as to any one certificate of deposit is $250,000;
therefore, certificates of deposit purchased by a Fund may not be fully
insured. A Fund may only invest in certificates of deposit issued by U.S.
banks with at least $1 billion in assets.


(3) A Fund may invest in bankers' acceptances, which are short-term
credit instruments used to finance commercial transactions. Generally, an
acceptance is a time draft drawn on a bank by an exporter or an importer
to obtain a stated amount of funds to pay for specific merchandise. The
draft is then "accepted" by a bank that, in effect, unconditionally
guarantees to pay the face value of the instrument on its maturity date.
The acceptance may then be held by the accepting bank as an asset or it
may be sold in the secondary market at the going rate of interest for a
specific maturity.


(4) A Fund may invest in repurchase agreements, which involve
purchases of debt securities with counterparties that are deemed by the
Advisor to present acceptable credit risks. In such an action, at the time
a Fund purchases the security, it simultaneously agrees to resell and
redeliver the security to the seller, who also simultaneously agrees to
buy back the security at a fixed price and time. This assures a
predetermined yield for a Fund during its holding period since the resale
price is always greater than the purchase price and reflects an
agreed-upon market rate. Such actions afford an opportunity for a Fund to
invest temporarily available cash. A Fund may enter into repurchase
agreements only with respect to obligations of the U.S. government, its
agencies or instrumentalities; certificates of deposit; or bankers'
acceptances in which a Fund may invest. Repurchase agreements may be
considered loans to the seller, collateralized by the underlying
securities. The risk to a Fund is limited to the ability of the seller to
pay the agreed-upon sum on the repurchase date; in the event of default,
the repurchase agreement provides that the affected Fund is entitled to
sell the underlying collateral. If the value of the collateral declines
after the agreement is entered into, however, and if the seller defaults
under a repurchase agreement when the value of the underlying collateral
is less than the repurchase price, a Fund could incur a loss of both
principal and interest. The portfolio managers monitor the value of the
collateral at the time the action is entered into and at all times during
the term of the repurchase agreement. The portfolio managers do so in an
effort to determine that the value of the collateral always equals or
exceeds the agreed-upon repurchase price to be paid to a Fund. If the


-11-





seller were to be subject to a federal bankruptcy proceeding, the ability
of a Fund to liquidate the collateral could be delayed or impaired because
of certain provisions of the bankruptcy laws.


(5) A Fund may invest in bank time deposits, which are monies kept
on deposit with banks or savings and loan associations for a stated period
of time at a fixed rate of interest. There may be penalties for the early
withdrawal of such time deposits, in which case the yields of these
investments will be reduced.


(6) A Fund may invest in commercial paper, which are short-term
unsecured promissory notes, including variable rate master demand notes
issued by corporations to finance their current operations. Master demand
notes are direct lending arrangements between the Fund and a corporation.
There is no secondary market for the notes. However, they are redeemable
by a Fund at any time. A Fund's portfolio managers will consider the
financial condition of the corporation (e.g., earning power, cash flow and
other liquidity ratios) and will continuously monitor the corporation's
ability to meet all of its financial obligations, because a Fund's
liquidity might be impaired if the corporation were unable to pay
principal and interest on demand. A Fund may invest in commercial paper
only if its has received the highest rating from at least one nationally
recognized statistical rating organization or, if unrated, judged by First
Trust to be of comparable quality.


(7) A Fund may invest in shares of money market funds, as consistent
with its investment objective and policies. Shares of money market funds
are subject to management fees and other expenses of those funds.
Therefore, investments in money market funds will cause the Fund to bear
proportionately the costs incurred by the money market funds' operations.
At the same time, a Fund will continue to pay its own management fees and
expenses with respect to all of its assets, including any portion invested
in the shares of other investment companies. Although money market funds
that operate in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act seek to
preserve a $1.00 share price, it is possible for the Fund to lose money by
investing in money market funds.


Delayed-Delivery Transactions: The Funds may from time to time purchase
securities on a "when-issued" or other delayed-delivery basis. The price of
securities purchased in such transactions is fixed at the time the commitment to
purchase is made, but delivery and payment for the securities take place at a
later date. During the period between the purchase and settlement, a Fund does
not remit payment to the issuer, no interest is accrued on debt securities and
dividend income is not earned on equity securities. Delayed-delivery commitments
involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased declines
prior to the settlement date, which risk is in addition to the risk of a decline
in value of a Fund's other assets. While securities purchased in
delayed-delivery transactions may be sold prior to the settlement date, the
Funds intend to purchase such securities with the purpose of actually acquiring
them. At the time a Fund makes the commitment to purchase a security in a
delayed-delivery transaction, it will record the transaction and reflect the
value of the security in determining its net asset value.


The Funds will earmark or maintain in a segregated account cash, U.S.
government securities, and high-grade liquid debt securities equal in value to
commitments for delayed-delivery securities. Such earmarked or segregated


-12-





securities will mature or, if necessary, be sold on or before the settlement
date. When the time comes to pay for delayed-delivery securities, a Fund will
meet its obligations from then-available cash flow, sale of the securities
earmarked or held in the segregated account described above, sale of other
securities, or, although it would not normally expect to do so, from the sale of
the delayed-delivery securities themselves (which may have a market value
greater or less than a Fund's payment obligation).


Although the Prospectus and this SAI describe certain permitted methods of
segregating assets or otherwise "covering" certain transactions, such
descriptions are not all-inclusive. Each Fund may segregate against or cover
such transactions using other methods permitted under the 1940 Act, the rules
and regulations thereunder, or orders issued by the SEC thereunder. For these
purposes, interpretations and guidance provided by the SEC staff may be taken
into account when deemed appropriate by a Fund.



HEDGING STRATEGIES



The Funds may engage in hedging activities and, in this regard, may
utilize forward contracts, currency spot transactions and futures contracts. The
use of futures is not a part of a principal investment strategy of the Funds.


Hedging or derivative instruments on securities generally are used to
hedge against price movements in one or more particular securities positions
that the Fund owns or intends to acquire. Such instruments may also be used to
"lock-in" realized but unrecognized gains in the value of portfolio securities.
Hedging instruments on stock indices, in contrast, generally are used to hedge
against price movements in broad market sectors in which the Fund has invested
or expects to invest. Hedging strategies, if successful, can reduce the risk of
loss by wholly or partially offsetting the negative effect of unfavorable price
movements in the investments being hedged. However, hedging strategies can also
reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive effect of favorable
price movements in the hedged investments. The use of hedging instruments is
subject to applicable regulations of the SEC, the several futures exchanges upon
which they are traded, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") and
various state regulatory authorities. In addition, the Fund's ability to use
hedging instruments may be limited by tax considerations.



GENERAL LIMITATIONS ON DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS



The Funds limit their direct investments in derivative instruments to the
extent necessary for the Advisor to claim the exclusion from regulation as a
"commodity pool operator" with respect to each Fund under CFTC Rule 4.5, as such
rule may be amended from time to time. Under Rule 4.5 as currently in effect,
the Funds limit their trading activity in certain derivative instruments

(excluding activity for "bona fide hedging purposes," as defined by the CFTC)

such that each meets one of the following tests: (i) aggregate initial margin
and premiums required to establish its futures, options on futures and swap
positions do not exceed 5% of the liquidation value of the applicable Fund's
portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and losses on such
positions; or (ii) aggregate net notional value of the applicable Fund's


-13-





futures, options on futures and swap positions does not exceed 100% of the
liquidation value of the Fund's portfolio, after taking into account unrealized
profits and losses on such positions.


The Advisor has filed a notice of eligibility for exclusion from the
definition of the term "commodity pool operator" with respect to each Fund with
the National Futures Association, the futures industry's self-regulatory
organization. If First Trust were no longer able to claim the exclusion for a
Fund, First Trust would be required to register as a "commodity pool operator,"
and the Fund and First Trust would be subject to regulation under the Commodity
Exchange Act (the "CEA").


The foregoing limitations are non-fundamental policies of the Funds and
may be changed without shareholder approval as regulatory agencies permit.



PORTFOLIO TURNOVER



The Funds buy and sell portfolio securities in the normal course of their
investment activities. The proportion of a Fund's investment portfolio that is
bought and sold during a year is known as the Fund's portfolio turnover rate. A
turnover rate of 100% would occur, for example, if the Fund bought and sold
securities valued at 100% of its net assets within one year. A high portfolio
turnover rate could result in the payment by the Fund of increased brokerage
costs, expenses and taxes.



LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES



In order to generate additional income, as a non-principal investment
strategy, First Trust is authorized to select certain Funds, with notice to the
Board of Trustees, to lend portfolio securities representing up to 33-1/3% of
the value of their total assets to broker-dealers, banks or other institutional
borrowers of securities. As with other extensions of credit, there may be risks
of delay in recovery of the securities or even loss of rights in the collateral
should the borrower of the securities fail financially. However, the Funds will
only enter into domestic loan arrangements with broker-dealers, banks or other
institutions, that First Trust has determined are creditworthy under guidelines
established by the Board of Trustees. The Funds will pay a portion of the income
earned on the lending transaction to the placing broker and may pay
administrative and custodial fees in connection with these loans. First Trust
may select any Fund to participate in securities lending program, at its
discretion with notice to the Board of Trustees.


In these loan arrangements, the Funds will receive collateral in the form
of cash, U.S. government securities or other high grade debt obligations equal
to at least 102% (for domestic securities) or 105% (for international
securities) of the market value of the securities loaned as determined at the
time of loan origination. This collateral must be valued daily by First Trust or
the applicable Fund's lending agent and, if the market value of the loaned
securities increases, the borrower must furnish additional collateral to the
Fund. During the time portfolio securities are on loan, the borrower pays the
Fund any dividends or interest paid on the securities. Loans are subject to
termination at any time by the Fund or the borrower. While a Fund does not have
the right to vote securities on loan, it would terminate the loan and regain the
right to vote if that were considered important with respect to the investment.
When a Fund lends portfolio securities to a borrower, payments in lieu of


-14-





dividends made by the borrower to the Fund will not constitute "qualified
dividends" taxable at the same rate as long-term capital gains, even if the
actual dividends would have constituted qualified dividends had the Fund held
the securities.






INVESTMENT RISKS



The following risk disclosure supplements the discussion of the Funds'
investment risks that appears in the Prospectus.



Overview



An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks
that an investment in the Fund's shares entails, including the risk that the
financial condition of the issuers of the securities held by the Fund or the
general condition of the securities market may worsen and the value of the
equity securities and therefore the value of the Fund may decline. A Fund may
not be an appropriate investment for those who are unable or unwilling to assume
the risks involved generally with such an investment. The past market and
earnings performance of any of the securities included in a Fund is not
predictive of their future performance.



Common Stock Risk



Common stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements
and to volatile increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and
perceptions of the issuers change. These perceptions are based on unpredictable
factors including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and
fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or
contraction, and global or regional political, economic or banking crises. First
Trust cannot predict the direction or scope of any of these factors.
Shareholders of common stocks have rights to receive payments from the issuers
of those common stocks that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of,
or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks of, such issuers.


Shareholders of common stocks of the type held by the Funds have a right
to receive dividends only when and if, and in the amounts, declared by the
issuer's board of directors and have a right to participate in amounts available
for distribution by the issuer only after all other claims on the issuer have
been paid. Common stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and,
therefore, do not offer any assurance of income or provide the same degree of
protection of capital as do debt securities. The issuance of additional debt
securities or preferred stock will create prior claims for payment of principal,
interest and dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination
of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its common stock or the rights of
holders of common stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or
bankruptcy. The value of common stocks is subject to market fluctuations for as
long as the common stocks remain outstanding, and thus the value of the equity
securities in the Funds will fluctuate over the life of the Funds and may be
more or less than the price at which they were purchased by the Funds. The
equity securities held in the Funds may appreciate or depreciate in value (or
pay dividends) depending on the full range of economic and market influences


-15-





affecting these securities, including the impact of a Fund's purchase and sale
of the equity securities and other factors.


Holders of common stocks incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks
and debt obligations because common stockholders, as owners of the entity, have
generally inferior rights to receive payments from the issuer in comparison with
the rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks
issued by, the issuer. Cumulative preferred stock dividends must be paid before
common stock dividends and any cumulative preferred stock dividend omitted is
added to future dividends payable to the holders of cumulative preferred stock.
Preferred stockholders are also generally entitled to rights on liquidation
which are senior to those of common stockholders.


Whether or not the equity securities in the Funds are listed on a
securities exchange, the principal trading market for certain of the equity
securities in certain of the Funds may be in the over-the-counter ("OTC")
market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading market for the equity
securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the equity
securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the
equity securities, that any market for the equity securities will be maintained
or that there will be sufficient liquidity of the equity securities in any
markets made. The price at which the equity securities are held in the Funds
will be adversely affected if trading markets for the equity securities are
limited or absent.



Cyber Security Risk



As the use of Internet technology has become more prevalent in the course
of business, the Fund has become more susceptible to potential operational risks
through breaches in cyber security. A breach in cyber security refers to both
intentional and unintentional events that may cause the Fund to lose proprietary
information, suffer data corruption or lose operational capacity. Such events
could cause the Fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage,
additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial
loss. Cyber security breaches may involve unauthorized access to the Fund's
digital information systems through "hacking" or malicious software coding, but
may also result from outside attacks such as denial-of-service attacks through
efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users. In addition,
cyber security breaches of the Fund's third party service providers, such as its
administrator, transfer agent, custodian or sub-advisor, as applicable, or
issuers in which the Fund invests, can also subject the Fund to many of the same
risks associated with direct cyber security breaches. The Fund has established
risk management systems designed to reduce the risks associated with cyber
security. However, there is no guarantee that such efforts will succeed,
especially because the Fund does not directly control the cyber security systems
of issuers or third party service providers.



Derivatives Risk



The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater
than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities.
The use of derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the
price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by
certain features of the derivatives. In addition, when a Fund invests in certain


-16-





derivative securities, including, but not limited to, when-issued securities,
forward commitments and futures contracts, they are effectively leveraging their
investments, which could result in exaggerated changes in the net asset value of
the Fund's shares and can result in losses that exceed the amount originally
invested. The success of the Sub-Advisor's derivatives strategies will depend on
its ability to assess and predict the impact of market or economic developments
on the underlying asset, index or rate and the derivative itself, without the
benefit of observing the performance of the derivative under all possible market
conditions. Liquidity risk exists when a security cannot be purchased or sold at
the time desired, or cannot be purchased or sold without adversely affecting the
price. Certain specific risks associated with an investment in derivatives may
include: market risk, credit risk, correlation risk, liquidity risk, legal risk
and systemic or "interconnection" risk, as specified below.


(1) Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of the
underlying assets may go up or down. Adverse movements in the value of an
underlying asset can expose the Funds to losses. Derivative instruments
may include elements of leverage and, accordingly, fluctuations in the
value of the derivative instrument in relation to the underlying asset may
be magnified. The successful use of derivative instruments depends upon a
variety of factors, particularly the ability of the portfolio managers to
predict correctly market movements or changes in the relationships of such
instruments to a Fund's portfolio holdings, and there can be no assurance
the judgment of the portfolio managers in this respect will be accurate.
Consequently, the use of derivatives for investment or hedging purposes
might result in a poorer overall performance for the Funds, whether or not
adjusted for risk, than if the Funds had not used derivatives.


(2) Credit/Counterparty Risk. Credit risk is the risk that a loss is
sustained as a result of the failure of a counterparty to comply with the
terms of a derivative instrument. The counterparty risk for
exchange-traded derivatives is generally lower than for over-the-counter
derivatives not cleared through a central counterparty, since generally a
clearing organization provides a guarantee of performance and cleared
derivative transactions benefit from daily mark-to-market and settlement
as well as from segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to
intermediaries. For privately-negotiated instruments not cleared through a
central counterparty, there are no similar protections. In all
transactions, a Fund will bear the risk that the counterparty will
default, and this could result in a loss of the expected benefit of the
derivative transactions and possibly other losses to the Fund. Such
counterparty risk is accentuated in the case of contracts with longer
maturities where there is a greater risk that a specific event may prevent
or delay settlement, or where the Fund has concentrated its transactions
with a single or small group of counterparties. The Funds are not
restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from
concentrating any or all of its transactions with one counterparty. The
Funds will enter into transactions in derivative instruments only with
counterparties that the portfolio managers reasonably believe are capable
of performing under the contract.


(3) Correlation Risk. Correlation risk is the risk that there might
be an imperfect correlation, or even no correlation, between price
movements of a derivative instrument and price movements of investments
being hedged. When a derivative transaction is used to completely hedge


-17-





another position, changes in the market value of the combined position
(the derivative instrument plus the position being hedged) result from an
imperfect correlation between the price movements of the two instruments.
With a perfect hedge, the value of the combined position remains unchanged
with any change in the price of the underlying asset. With an imperfect
hedge, the value of the derivative instrument and its hedge are not
perfectly correlated. For example, if the value of a derivative instrument
used in a short hedge (such as selling a futures contract) increased by
less than the decline in value of the hedged investments, the hedge would
not be perfectly correlated. This might occur due to factors unrelated to
the value of the investments being hedged, such as speculative or other
pressures on the markets in which these instruments are traded. In
addition, a Fund's success in using hedging instruments is subject to the
ability of the portfolio managers to correctly predict changes in
relationships of such hedge instruments to the Fund's portfolio holdings,
and there can be no assurance that the judgment of the portfolio managers
in this respect will be accurate. An imperfect correlation may prevent a
Fund from achieving the intended hedge or expose the Fund to a risk of
loss.


(4) Liquidity Risk. Liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative
instrument cannot be sold, closed out, or replaced quickly at or very
close to its fundamental value. Generally, exchange contracts are more
liquid than over-the-counter transactions. The illiquidity of the
derivatives markets may be due to various factors, including congestion,
disorderly markets, limitations on deliverable supplies, the participation
of speculators, government regulation and intervention, and technical and
operational or system failures. In addition, daily limits on price
fluctuations and speculative position limits on exchanges on which the
Funds may conduct their transactions in derivative instruments may prevent
prompt liquidation of positions, subjecting the Funds to the potential of
greater losses. The Funds might be required by applicable regulatory
requirements to maintain assets as "cover," maintain segregated accounts
and/or make margin payments when they take positions in derivative
instruments involving obligations to third parties (i.e., instruments
other than purchase options). If a Fund is unable to close out its
positions in such instruments, it might be required to continue to
maintain such accounts or make such payments until the position expires,
matures, or is closed out. These requirements might impair the Fund's
ability to sell a security or make an investment at a time when it would
otherwise be favorable to do so, or require that the Fund sell a portfolio
security at a disadvantageous time. The Funds' ability to sell or close
out a position in an instrument prior to expiration or maturity depends
upon the existence of a liquid secondary market or, in the absence of such
a market, the ability and willingness of a counterparty to enter into a
transaction closing out the position. Due to liquidity risk, there is no
assurance that any derivatives position can be sold or closed out at a
time and price that is favorable to the Funds.


(5) Legal Risk. Legal risk is the risk of loss caused by the
unenforceability of a party's obligations under the derivative. While a
party seeking price certainty agrees to surrender the potential upside in
exchange for downside protection, the party taking the risk is looking for
a positive payoff. Despite this voluntary assumption of risk, a


-18-





counterparty that has lost money in a derivative transaction may try to
avoid payment by exploiting various legal uncertainties about certain
derivative products.


(6) Volatility. The prices of many derivative instruments are highly
volatile. Price movements of such instruments may be influenced by, among
other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships,
trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of
governments, and national and international political and economic events
and policies. The value of such instruments also may depend upon the price
of the securities or currencies underlying them.


(7) Systemic or "Interconnection" Risk. Systemic or interconnection
risk is the risk that a disruption in the financial markets will cause
difficulties for all market participants. In other words, a disruption in
one market will spill over into other markets, perhaps creating a chain
reaction. Much of the over-the-counter derivatives market takes place
among the over-the-counter dealers themselves, thus creating a large
interconnected web of financial obligations. This interconnectedness
raises the possibility that a default by one large dealer could create
losses for other dealers and destabilize the entire market for
over-the-counter derivative instruments.



Emerging Markets Risk



Investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries
are considered speculative and are subject to greater levels of non-U.S.
securities risk than investments in more developed non-U.S. markets. Heightened
risks of investing in emerging markets securities include: (i) smaller market
capitalization of securities markets, which may suffer periods of relative
illiquidity; (ii) significant price volatility; (iii) restrictions on foreign
investment; (iv) possible repatriation of investment income and capital; (v)
increased risk of default (including both government and private issuers); (vi)
greater social, economic and political uncertainty and instability (including
the risk of war); (vii) more substantial governmental involvement in the
economy; (viii) less governmental supervision and regulation of the securities
markets and participants in those markets; (ix) unavailability of currency
hedging techniques in certain emerging market countries; and (x) the fact that
companies in emerging market countries may be newly organized, smaller and less
seasoned. Furthermore, foreign investors may be required to register the
proceeds of sales and future economic or political crises could lead to price
controls, forced mergers, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, seizure,
nationalization or creation of government monopolies. The currencies of emerging
market countries may experience significant declines against the U.S. dollar,
and devaluation may occur subsequent to investments in these currencies by the
Funds. Inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had, and may
continue to have, negative effects on the economies and securities markets of
certain emerging market countries.



Foreign Currency Risk



The Funds will engage in practices and strategies that will result in
exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, thus subjecting the Funds to
foreign currency risk. The Funds' exposure to foreign currencies or in
securities or instruments that trade, or receive revenues, in foreign currencies
are subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to


-19-





the U.S. dollar or, in the case of hedging positions, that the U.S. dollar will
decline in value relative to the currency being hedged. Currency rates in
foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a
number of reasons, including the forces of supply and demand in the non-U.S.
exchange markets, actual or perceived changes in interest rates, rates of
inflation, balance of payments and governmental surpluses or deficits,
intervention (or the failure to intervene) by U.S. or foreign governments,
central banks or supranational entities such as the International Monetary Fund,
or by the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the
United States or abroad. These fluctuations may have a significant adverse
impact on the value of a Fund's portfolio and/or the level of Fund distributions
made to its common shareholders. The Funds will seek to hedge exposure to reduce
the risk of loss due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. There is no
assurance, however, that these strategies will be available or will be
successful and the Funds will incur costs associated with such strategies.


Currency transactions are subject to risks different from those of other
portfolio transactions. Because currency control is of great importance to the
issuing governments and influences economic planning and policy, purchases and
sales of currency and related instruments can be negatively affected by
government exchange controls, blockages, and manipulations or exchange
restrictions imposed by governments. These can result in losses if the Funds are
unable to deliver or receive currency or funds in settlement of obligations and
could also cause hedges they have entered into to be rendered useless, resulting
in full currency exposure as well as incurring transactions costs. Currency
exchange rates may fluctuate based on factors extrinsic to that country's
economy.



Geographic Concentration Risk



The Funds may invest from time to time a substantial amount of their
assets in issuers located in a single country or region. Investments in a single
region, although representing a number of different countries within the region,
may be affected by common economic forces and other factors. Because the Funds
may concentrate their investments in this manner, it assumes the risk that
economic, political and social conditions in those countries will have a
significant impact on their investment performance.



Market Disruption and Geopolitical Risk



Some countries in which the Funds invest have experienced security
concerns, war or threats of war and aggression, terrorism, economic uncertainty,
natural and environmental disasters and/or systemic market dislocations that
have led, and in the future may lead, to increased short term market volatility
and may have adverse long term effects on the economies and markets of such
countries generally, each of which may negatively impact the Funds' investments.
For example, there have been various events throughout Europe, including
Russia's annexation of Crimea and the resulting sanctions against Russia,
ongoing tension between Russia and Ukraine and the political uncertainty and
market turmoil in Greece, that have recently had and may continue to have an
adverse impact on European and global markets. It is possible, for instance,
that the events occurring in Russia could result in, among other things, Russia
withholding its natural gas supply from other European countries, which has the
potential to harm the economies and markets of such countries. The events
occurring in one country or region may spread through, or otherwise affect,


-20-





other countries and regions and therefore adversely impact the Funds'
investments in such countries and regions.


In addition, the terrorist attacks in the U.S. on September 11, 2001 had a
disruptive effect on the securities markets. The ongoing U.S. military and
related action throughout the world, as well as the continuing threat of
terrorist attacks, could have significant adverse effects on the U.S. economy,
the stock market and world economies and markets generally. A similar disruption
of financial markets or other terrorist attacks could adversely affect Fund
service providers and/or the Funds' operations as well as interest rates,
secondary trading, credit risk, inflation and other factors relating to the
common shares of the Funds. A Fund cannot predict the effects or likelihood of
similar events in the future on the U.S. and world economies, the value of its
common shares or the NAV of the Fund.



Non-U.S. Securities Risk



Investing in securities of non-U.S. issuers, which are generally
denominated in non-U.S. currencies, may involve certain risks not typically
associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include:

(i) there may be less publicly available information about non-U.S. issuers or
markets due to less rigorous disclosure or accounting standards or regulatory
practices, as non-U.S. companies are generally not subject to the same
accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards as are U.S. companies;

(ii) non-U.S. markets may be smaller, less liquid and more volatile than the
U.S. market; (iii) potential adverse effects of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates or controls on the value of the Funds' investments; (iv) the
economies of non-U.S. countries may grow at slower rates than expected or may
experience a downturn or recession; (v) the impact of economic, political,
social or diplomatic events, including the risk of adverse political
developments, nationalization, military unrest, social instability, war and
terrorism, confiscation without fair compensation, expropriation or confiscatory
taxation, limitations on the movement of funds and other assets between
different countries, or diplomatic developments; (vi) certain non-U.S. countries
may impose restrictions on the ability of non-U.S. issuers to make payments of
principal and interest to investors located in the United States due to blockage
of non-U.S. currency exchanges or otherwise; and (vii) withholding and other
non-U.S. taxes may decrease a Fund's return. Action by these governments could
have a significant effect on market prices of securities and dividend payments.
In the event of nationalization, expropriation or other confiscation, the Funds
could lose their entire investment in non-U.S. securities. In addition to the
foregoing risks, there may be difficulty in obtaining or enforcing a court
judgment abroad. These risks may be more pronounced to the extent that the Funds
invest a significant amount of their assets in companies located in one region
or in emerging markets (as described above).


Governments in certain foreign countries continue to participate to a
significant degree, through ownership interest or regulation, in their
respective economies. Furthermore, many countries throughout the world are
dependent on a healthy U.S. economy and are adversely affected when the U.S.
economy weakens or its markets decline. Additionally, many foreign country
economies are heavily dependent on international trade and are adversely
affected by protective trade barriers and economic conditions of their trading
partners. Protectionist trade legislation enacted by those trading partners
could have a significant adverse affect on the securities markets of those
countries. Individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from
the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross national product, rate of
inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of
payments position.


-21-





Fixed commissions on foreign securities exchanges are generally higher
than negotiated commissions on U.S. exchanges, although the Funds endeavor to
achieve the most favorable net results on its portfolio transactions. There is
generally less government supervision and regulation of foreign securities
exchanges, brokers, dealers and listed and unlisted companies than in the United
States, and the legal remedies for investors may be more limited than the
remedies available in the United States. For example, there may be no comparable
provisions under certain foreign laws to insider trading and similar investor
protections that apply with respect to securities transactions consummated in
the United States. Mail service between the United States and foreign countries
may be slower or less reliable than within the United States, thus increasing
the risk of delayed settlement of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates
for portfolio securities.


Foreign markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures,
and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have been unable
to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it difficult to
conduct such transactions. Such delays in settlement could result in temporary
periods when some of the Funds' assets are uninvested and no return is earned on
such assets. The inability of a Fund to make intended security purchases due to
settlement problems could cause the Fund to miss attractive investment
opportunities. Inability to dispose of portfolio securities due to settlement
problems could result either in losses to the Funds due to subsequent declines
in value of the portfolio securities or, if the Funds have entered into a
contract to sell the securities, in possible liability to the purchaser.



Passive Foreign Investment Companies Risk



A Fund may invest in companies that are considered to be "passive foreign
investment companies" ("PFICs"), which are generally certain non-U.S.
corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive
sources (such as interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties or capital
gains) or that hold at least 50% of their assets in investments producing such
passive income. Therefore, the Fund could be subject to U.S. federal income tax
and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect
to those equity interests, even if all the income or gain is distributed to its
shareholders in a timely manner. A Fund will not be able to pass through to its
shareholders any credit or deduction for such taxes.






Real Estate Investment Trust Risk



REITs are financial vehicles that pool investors' capital to purchase or
finance real estate. REITs may concentrate their investments in specific
geographic areas or in specific property types, e.g., hotels, shopping malls,
residential complexes and office buildings. The market value of REIT shares and
the ability of the REITs to distribute income may be adversely affected by
several factors, including: (i) rising interest rates; (ii) changes in the
economic climate and real estate conditions; (iii) perceptions of prospective
tenants of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the properties; (iv)
the ability of the owners to provide adequate management, maintenance and
insurance; (v) the cost of complying with local laws; (vi) increased competition
from new properties; (vii) the impact of present or future environmental
legislation and compliance with environmental laws; (viii) changes in real
estate taxes and other operating expenses; (ix) adverse changes in governmental
rules and fiscal policies; (x) adverse changes in zoning laws; and (xi) other


-22-





factors beyond the control of the REITs including changes in tax laws. In
addition, distributions received by the Funds from REITs may consist of
dividends, capital gains and/or return of capital. Many of these distributions,
however, when further distributed to shareholders will not generally qualify for
favorable treatment as qualified dividend income.


Certain REITs have relatively small market capitalizations. As such, REITs
may have limited financial resources and their securities may trade less
frequently and in limited volume and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic
price movements than larger company securities. Furthermore, REITs are dependent
upon specialized management skills and have limited diversification. REITs are
also subject to heavy cash flow dependency, defaults by borrowers or lessees and
the possibility of failing to qualify for favorable tax treatment. By investing
in REITs indirectly through a Fund, a shareholder will bear not only his or her
proportionate share of the expenses of the Fund, but also, indirectly, similar
expenses of the REITs. In addition, REITs depend generally on their ability to
generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders. REITs may incur
significant amounts of leverage.






MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS







TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS



The general supervision of the duties performed for the Funds under the
investment management agreement is the responsibility of the Board of Trustees.
There are five Trustees of the Trust, one of whom is an "interested person" (as
the term is defined in the 1940 Act) and four of whom are Trustees who are not
officers or employees of First Trust or any of its affiliates ("Independent
Trustees"). The Trustees set broad policies for the Funds, choose the Trust's
officers and hire the Trust's investment advisor. The officers of the Trust
manage its day-to-day operations and are responsible to the Trust's Board of
Trustees. The following is a list of the Trustees and executive officers of the
Trust and a statement of their present positions and principal occupations
during the past five years, the number of portfolios each Trustee oversees and
the other directorships they have held during the past five years, if
applicable. Each Trustee has been elected for an indefinite term. The officers
of the Trust serve indefinite terms. Each Trustee, except for James A. Bowen, is
an Independent Trustee. Mr. Bowen is deemed an "interested person" (as that term
is defined in the 1940 Act) ("Interested Trustee") of the Trust due to his
position as Chief Executive Officer of First Trust, investment advisor to the
Funds.

Each Trustee serves as a trustee of all open-end and closed-end funds in
the First Trust Fund Complex (as defined below), which is known as a "unitary"
board leadership structure. Each Trustee currently serves as a trustee of First
Trust Series Fund and First Trust Variable Insurance Trust, open-end funds with
seven portfolios advised by First Trust; First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income
Fund II, Macquarie/First Trust Global Infrastructure/Utilities Dividend & Income
Fund, First Trust Energy Income and Growth Fund, First Trust Enhanced Equity
Income Fund, First Trust/Aberdeen Global Opportunity Income Fund, First Trust
Mortgage Income Fund, First Trust Strategic High Income Fund II, First
Trust/Aberdeen Emerging Opportunity Fund, First Trust Specialty Finance and
Financial Opportunities Fund, First Trust Dividend and Income Fund, First Trust
High Income Long/Short Fund, First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund, First Trust

MLP and Energy Income Fund, First Trust New Opportunities MLP & Energy Fund,
First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund and First Trust Intermediate
Duration Preferred & Income Fund, closed-end funds advised by First Trust; First
Trust Exchange-Traded Fund, First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund II, First Trust
Exchange-Traded Fund III, First Trust Exchange Traded Fund IV, First Trust
Exchange Traded Fund V, First Trust Exchange Traded Fund VI, First Trust
Exchange Traded Fund VII, First Trust Exchange Traded Fund VIII, First Trust
Exchange-Traded AlphaDEX(R) Fund and First Trust Exchange-Traded AlphaDEX(R)
Fund II, exchange-traded funds with 103 portfolios advised by First Trust (each
a "First Trust Fund" and collectively, the "First Trust Fund Complex"). None of
the Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the Trust, nor any of their
immediate family members, has ever been a director, officer or employee of, or
consultant to, First Trust, First Trust Portfolios L.P. or their affiliates.


The management of the Funds, including general supervision of the duties
performed for the Funds under the investment management agreement between the
Trust, on behalf of the Funds, and the Advisor, is the responsibility of the
Board of Trustees. The Trustees of the Trust set broad policies for the Funds,
choose the Trust's officers, and hire the Funds' investment advisor and other
service providers. The officers of the Trust manage the day to-day operations
and are responsible to the Trust's Board. The Trust's Board is composed of four
Independent Trustees and one Interested Trustee. The Interested Trustee, James

A. Bowen, serves as the Chairman of the Board for each fund in the First Trust
Fund Complex.


The same five persons serve as Trustees on the Trust's Board and on the
Boards of all other First Trust Funds. The unitary board structure was adopted
for the First Trust Funds because of the efficiencies it achieves with respect
to the governance and oversight of the First Trust Funds. Each First Trust Fund
is subject to the rules and regulations of the 1940 Act (and other applicable
securities laws), which means that many of the First Trust Funds face similar
issues with respect to certain of their fundamental activities, including risk
management, portfolio liquidity, portfolio valuation and financial reporting.
Because of the similar and often overlapping issues facing the First Trust
Funds, including among the First Trust exchange-traded funds, the Board of the
First Trust Funds believes that maintaining a unitary board structure promotes
efficiency and consistency in the governance and oversight of all First Trust
Funds and reduces the costs, administrative burdens and possible conflicts that
may result from having multiple boards. In adopting a unitary board structure,
the Trustees seek to provide effective governance through establishing a board
the overall composition of which will, as a body, possess the appropriate
skills, diversity, independence and experience to oversee the Funds' business.


Annually, the Board reviews its governance structure and the committee
structures, their performance and functions, and it reviews any processes that
would enhance Board governance over the Funds' business. The Board has
determined that its leadership structure, including the unitary board and
committee structure, is appropriate based on the characteristics of the funds it
serves and the characteristics of the First Trust Fund Complex as a whole.


In order to streamline communication between the Advisor and the
Independent Trustees and create certain efficiencies, the Board has a Lead
Independent Trustee who is responsible for: (i) coordinating activities of the
Independent Trustees; (ii) working with the Advisor, Fund counsel and the


-27-





independent legal counsel to the Independent Trustees to determine the agenda
for Board meetings; (iii) serving as the principal contact for and facilitating
communication between the Independent Trustees and the Funds' service providers,
particularly the Advisor; and (iv) any other duties that the Independent
Trustees may delegate to the Lead Independent Trustee. The Lead Independent
Trustee is selected by the Independent Trustees and serves a three year term or
until his or her successor is selected.


The Board has established four standing committees (as described below)
and has delegated certain of its responsibilities to those committees. The Board
and its committees meet frequently throughout the year to oversee the Funds'
activities, review contractual arrangements with and performance of service
providers, oversee compliance with regulatory requirements, and review Fund
performance. The Independent Trustees are represented by independent legal
counsel at all Board and committee meetings (other than meetings of the
Executive Committee). Generally, the Board acts by majority vote of all the
Trustees, including a majority vote of the Independent Trustees if required by
applicable law.


The three Committee Chairmen and the Lead Independent Trustee rotate every
three years in serving as Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Nominating and
Governance Committee or the Valuation Committee or as Lead Independent Trustee.
The Lead Independent Trustee and immediate past Lead Independent Trustee also
serve on the Executive Committee with the Interested Trustee.


The four standing committees of the First Trust Fund Complex are: the
Executive Committee (and Pricing and Dividend Committee), the Nominating and
Governance Committee, the Valuation Committee and the Audit Committee. The
Executive Committee, which meets between Board meetings, is authorized to
exercise all powers of and to act in the place of the Board of Trustees to the
extent permitted by the Trust's Declaration of Trust and By Laws. Such Committee
is also responsible for the declaration and setting of dividends. Mr. Kadlec,
Mr. Bowen and Mr. Keith are members of the Executive Committee.


The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for appointing and
nominating non-interested persons to the Trust's Board of Trustees. Messrs.
Erickson, Kadlec, Keith and Nielson are members of the Nominating and Governance
Committee. If there is no vacancy on the Board of Trustees, the Board will not
actively seek recommendations from other parties, including shareholders. The
Board of Trustees adopted a mandatory retirement age of 75 for Trustees, beyond
which age Trustees are ineligible to serve. The Committee will not consider new
trustee candidates who are 72 years of age or older. When a vacancy on the Board
of Trustees occurs and nominations are sought to fill such vacancy, the
Nominating and Governance Committee may seek nominations from those sources it
deems appropriate in its discretion, including shareholders of the applicable
Fund. To submit a recommendation for nomination as a candidate for a position on
the Board of Trustees, shareholders of the applicable Fund should mail such
recommendation to W. Scott Jardine, Secretary, at the Trust's address, 120 East
Liberty Drive, Suite 400, Wheaton, Illinois 60187. Such recommendation shall
include the following information: (i) evidence of Fund ownership of the person
or entity recommending the candidate (if a Fund shareholder); (ii) a full
description of the proposed candidate's background, including education,
experience, current employment and date of birth; (iii) names and addresses of


-28-





at least three professional references for the candidate; (iv) information as to
whether the candidate is an "interested person" in relation to the Funds, as
such term is defined in the 1940 Act, and such other information that may be
considered to impair the candidate's independence; and (v) any other information
that may be helpful to the Committee in evaluating the candidate. If a
recommendation is received with satisfactorily completed information regarding a
candidate during a time when a vacancy exists on the Board or during such other
time as the Nominating and Governance Committee is accepting recommendations,
the recommendation will be forwarded to the Chairman of the Nominating and
Governance Committee and to counsel to the Independent Trustees. Recommendations
received at any other time will be kept on file until such time as the
Nominating and Governance Committee is accepting recommendations, at which point
they may be considered for nomination.


The Valuation Committee is responsible for the oversight of the valuation
procedures of the Funds (the "Valuation Procedures"), for determining the fair
value of the Funds' securities or other assets under certain circumstances as
described in the Valuation Procedures and for evaluating the performance of any
pricing service for the Funds. Messrs. Erickson, Kadlec, Keith and Nielson are
members of the Valuation Committee.


The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing each Fund's accounting
and financial reporting process, the system of internal controls and audit
process and for evaluating and appointing independent auditors (subject also to
Board approval). Messrs. Erickson, Kadlec, Keith and Nielson serve on the Audit
Committee.



EXECUTIVE OFFICERS



The executive officers of the Trust hold the same positions with each fund
in the First Trust Fund Complex (representing 126 portfolios) as they hold with
the Trust.



RISK OVERSIGHT



As part of the general oversight of the Funds, the Board is involved in
the risk oversight of the Funds. The Board has adopted and periodically reviews
policies and procedures designed to address each Fund's risks. Oversight of
investment and compliance risk is performed primarily at the Board level in
conjunction with the Advisor's investment oversight group and the Trust's Chief
Compliance Officer ("CCO"). Oversight of other risks also occurs at the
committee level. The Advisor's investment oversight group reports to the Board
at quarterly meetings regarding, among other things, Fund performance and the
various drivers of such performance. The Board reviews reports on the Funds' and
the service providers' compliance policies and procedures at each quarterly
Board meeting and receives an annual report from the CCO regarding the
operations of the Funds' and the service providers' compliance program. In
addition, the Independent Trustees meet privately each quarter with the CCO. The
Audit Committee reviews with the Advisor each Fund's major financial risk
exposures and the steps the Advisor has taken to monitor and control these
exposures, including each Fund's risk assessment and risk management policies
and guidelines. The Audit Committee also, as appropriate, reviews in a general
manner the processes other Board committees have in place with respect to risk
assessment and risk management. The Nominating and Governance Committee monitors


-29-





all matters related to the corporate governance of the Trust. The Valuation
Committee monitors valuation risk and compliance with the Funds' Valuation
Procedures and oversees the pricing services and actions by the Advisor's
Pricing Committee with respect to the valuation of portfolio securities.


Not all risks that may affect the Funds can be identified nor can controls
be developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects. It may not be
practical or cost effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, the
processes and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their
effectiveness, and some risks are simply beyond the reasonable control of the
Funds or the Advisor or other service providers. For instance, as the use of
Internet technology has become more prevalent, the Funds and their service
providers have become more susceptible to potential operational risks through
breaches in cyber security (generally, intentional and unintentional events that
may cause a Fund or a service provider to lose proprietary information, suffer
data corruption or lose operational capacity). There can be no guarantee that
any risk management systems established by the Funds, their service providers,
or issuers of the securities in which the Funds invest to reduce cyber security
risks will succeed, and the Funds cannot control such systems put in place by
service providers, issuers or other third parties whose operations may affect
the Funds and/or its shareholders. Moreover, it is necessary to bear certain
risks (such as investment related risks) to achieve a Fund's goals. As a result
of the foregoing and other factors, the Funds' ability to manage risk is subject
to substantial limitations.



BOARD DIVERSIFICATION AND TRUSTEE QUALIFICATIONS



As described above, the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board
oversees matters related to the nomination of Trustees. The Nominating and
Governance Committee seeks to establish an effective Board with an appropriate
range of skills and diversity, including, as appropriate, differences in
background, professional experience, education, vocation, and other individual
characteristics and traits in the aggregate. Each Trustee must meet certain
basic requirements, including relevant skills and experience, time availability,
and if qualifying as an Independent Trustee, independence from the Advisor,
underwriters or other service providers, including any affiliates of these
entities.


Listed below for each current Trustee are the experiences, qualifications
and attributes that led to the conclusion, as of the date of this SAI, that each
current Trustee should serve as a Trustee in light of the Trust's business and

Conflicts of Interest. Actual or apparent conflicts of interest may arise
when a portfolio manager has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect
to more than one fund or other account. More specifically, portfolio managers
who manage multiple funds and/or other accounts may be presented with one or
more of the potential conflicts described below.


The management of multiple funds and/or other accounts may result in a
portfolio manager devoting unequal time and attention to the management of each
fund and/or other account. The Sub-Advisor seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of a portfolio manager by having the
portfolio manager focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other
accounts managed by a portfolio manager are managed using a similar investment
model that is used in connection with the management of the Funds. The Funds are
expected to be included as part of a broader investment program developed by the
Sub-Advisor and managed by the portfolio managers. The portfolio managers will
be required to satisfy their duties to both the Funds and the accounts that
invest in these broader programs. Conflicts may potentially arise when the
portfolio managers attempt to satisfy the needs of each type of customer. The
Sub-Advisor has developed procedures to address these potential conflicts.


If a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity that
may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, a fund may not be able
to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an allocation of filled
purchase or sale orders across all eligible funds and other accounts. To deal
with these situations, the Sub-Advisor has adopted procedures for allocating


-38-





portfolio transactions across multiple accounts. However, First Trust will be
responsible for effecting all security transactions for the Funds' assets and,
in placing orders for the sale and purchase of securities for the Funds, First
Trust will be responsible for seeking the best execution of such orders.


With respect to securities transactions for the Funds, First Trust
determines which broker to use to execute each order, consistent with its duty
to seek best execution of the transaction. However, with respect to certain
other accounts (such as mutual funds for which the Sub-Advisor acts as
sub-advisor, other pooled investment vehicles that are not registered mutual
funds, and other accounts managed for organizations and individuals), the
Sub-Advisor may be limited by the client with respect to the selection of
brokers or may be instructed to direct trades through a particular broker. In
these cases, trades for the Fund in a particular security may be placed
separately from, rather than aggregated with, such other accounts. Having
separate transactions with respect to a security may temporarily affect the
market price of the security or the execution of the transaction, or both, to
the possible detriment of the Fund or other account(s) involved.


The Sub-Advisor, the Advisor and the Funds have adopted certain compliance
procedures that are designed to address these types of conflicts. However, there
is no guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation in
which a conflict arises.


The Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Sub-Advisor, subject to the Board of
Trustees' and Advisor's supervision, provides the Funds with discretionary
investment services. Specifically, the Sub-Advisor is responsible for managing
the investments of the Fund in accordance with the Funds' investment objectives,
policies and restrictions as provided in the Prospectus and this SAI, as may be
subsequently changed by the Board of Trustees and communicated to the
Sub-Advisor in writing. The Sub-Advisor further agrees to conform to all
applicable laws and regulations of the SEC in all material respects and to
conduct its activities under the Sub-Advisory Agreement in all material respects
in accordance with applicable regulations of any governmental authority
pertaining to its investment advisory services. In the performance of its
duties, the Sub-Advisor will in all material respects satisfy any applicable
fiduciary duties it may have to the Funds, will monitor the Funds' investments
and will comply with the provisions of the Trust's Declaration of Trust and
By-Laws, as amended from time to time, and the stated investment objective,
policies and restrictions of the Funds. First Trust is responsible for effecting
all security transactions for the Funds' assets. The Sub-Advisory Agreement
provides that the Sub-Advisor shall generally not be liable for any loss
suffered by the Funds or the Advisor (including, without limitation, by reason
of the purchase, sale or retention of any security) in connection with the
performance of the Sub-Advisor's duties under the Sub-Advisory Agreement, except
for a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on
the part of the Sub-Advisor in performance of its duties under the Sub-Advisory
Agreement, or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties
under the Sub-Advisory Agreement.


Pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement among the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor
and the Fund, the Advisor has agreed to pay for the services and facilities
provided by the Sub-Advisor through sub-advisory fees, as set forth in the
Funds' Prospectus.


-39-





The Sub-Advisory Agreement may be terminated without the payment of any
penalty by First Trust, the Board of Trustees, or a majority of the outstanding
voting securities of the Funds (as defined in the 1940 Act), upon 60 days'
written notice to the Sub-Advisor.


All fees and expenses are accrued daily and deducted before payment of
dividends to investors. The Sub-Advisory Agreement has been approved by the
Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the
Funds, and the initial shareholder of the Funds.



BROKERAGE ALLOCATIONS



First Trust is responsible for decisions to buy and sell securities for
the Funds and for the placement of the Funds' securities business, the
negotiation of the commissions to be paid on brokered transactions, the prices
for principal trades in securities, and the allocation of portfolio brokerage
and principal business. It is the policy of First Trust to seek the best
execution at the best security price available with respect to each transaction,
and with respect to brokered transactions in light of the overall quality of
brokerage and research services provided to First Trust and its clients. The
best price to a Fund means the best net price without regard to the mix between
purchase or sale price and commission, if any. Purchases may be made from
underwriters, dealers, and, on occasion, the issuers. Commissions will be paid
on the Fund's futures and options transactions, if any. The purchase price of
portfolio securities purchased from an underwriter or dealer may include
underwriting commissions and dealer spreads. The Funds may pay markups on
principal transactions. In selecting broker/dealers and in negotiating
commissions, First Trust considers, among other things, the firm's reliability,
the quality of its execution services on a continuing basis and its financial
condition. Fund portfolio transactions may be effected with broker/dealers who
have assisted investors in the purchase of shares.


Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"1934 Act") permits an investment advisor, under certain circumstances, to cause
an account to pay a broker or dealer who supplies brokerage and research
services a commission for effecting a transaction in excess of the amount of
commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the
transaction. Brokerage and research services include (a) furnishing advice as to
the value of securities, the advisability of investing, purchasing or selling
securities, and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of
securities; (b) furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers, industries,
securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy, and the performance
of accounts; and (c) effecting securities transactions and performing functions
incidental thereto (such as clearance, settlement and custody). Such brokerage
and research services are often referred to as "soft dollars." First Trust may
use soft dollars on a limited basis.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, in selecting brokers, the First Trust may
in the future consider investment and market information and other research,
such as economic, securities and performance measurement research, provided by
such brokers, and the quality and reliability of brokerage services, including
execution capability, performance, and financial responsibility. Accordingly,
the commissions charged by any such broker may be greater than the amount
another firm might charge if First Trust determines in good faith that the
amount of such commissions is reasonable in relation to the value of the
research information and brokerage services provided by such broker to the First
Trust or the Trust. In addition, First Trust must determine that the research


-40-





information received in this manner provides the Funds with benefits by
supplementing the research otherwise available to the Funds. The Investment
Management Agreement provides that such higher commissions will not be paid by
the Funds unless First Trust determines in good faith that the amount is
reasonable in relation to the services provided. The investment advisory fees
paid by the Funds to First Trust under the Investment Management Agreement would
not be reduced as a result of receipt by First Trust of research services.


The First Trust places portfolio transactions for other advisory accounts
advised by it, and research services furnished by firms through which the Funds
effect their securities transactions may be used by First Trust in servicing all
of its accounts; not all of such services may be used by First Trust in
connection with the Funds. First Trust believes it is not possible to measure
separately the benefits from research services to each of the accounts
(including the Funds) advised by it. Because the volume and nature of the
trading activities of the accounts are not uniform, the amount of commissions in
excess of those charged by another broker paid by each account for brokerage and
research services will vary. However, First Trust believes such costs to the
Funds will not be disproportionate to the benefits received by the Funds on a
continuing basis. First Trust seeks to allocate portfolio transactions equitably
whenever concurrent decisions are made to purchase or sell securities by the
Funds and another advisory account. In some cases, this procedure could have an
adverse effect on the price or the amount of securities available to the Funds.
In making such allocations between the Funds and other advisory accounts, the
main factors considered by First Trust are the respective investment objectives,
the relative size of portfolio holding of the same or comparable securities, the
availability of cash for investment and the size of investment commitments
generally held.



CUSTODIAN, ADMINISTRATOR, FUND ACCOUNTANT, TRANSFER AGENT,

DISTRIBUTOR AND EXCHANGE



Custodian, Administrator, Fund Accountant and Transfer Agent. Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. ("BBH"), as custodian for the Fund pursuant to a
Custodian Agreement, holds the Fund's assets. Also, pursuant to an
Administrative Agency Agreement, BBH provides certain administrative and
accounting services to the Fund, including maintaining the Fund's books of
account, records of the Fund's securities transactions and certain other books
and records; acting as liaison with the Fund's independent registered public
accounting firm by providing such accountant with various audit-related
information with respect to the Fund; and providing other continuous accounting
and administrative services. BBH also serves as the Fund's transfer agent
pursuant to an Administrative Agency Agreement. BBH is located at 50 Post Office
Square, Boston, Massachusetts, 02110.


Pursuant to the Administrative Agency Agreement, the Trust on behalf of
the Fund has agreed to indemnify the Administrator for certain liabilities,
including certain liabilities arising under the federal securities laws, unless
such loss or liability results from negligence or willful misconduct in the
performance of its duties.


Pursuant to the Fund Administration and Accounting Agreement between BBH
and the Trust, the Fund has agreed to pay such compensation as is mutually
agreed from time to time and such out-of-pocket expenses as incurred by BBH in
the performance of its duties.


-41-





Distributor. First Trust Portfolios L.P., an affiliate of First Trust, is
the distributor ("FTP" or the "Distributor") and principal underwriter of the
shares of the Funds. Its principal address is 120 East Liberty Drive, Suite 400,
Wheaton, Illinois 60187. The Distributor has entered into a Distribution
Agreement with the Trust pursuant to which it distributes Fund shares. Shares
are continuously offered for sale by the Funds through the Distributor only in
Creation Unit Aggregations, as described in the Prospectus and below under the
heading "Creation and Redemption of Creation Unit Aggregations."


12b-1 Plan. The Trust has adopted a Plan of Distribution pursuant to Rule
12b-1 under the 1940 Act (the "Plan") pursuant to which the Funds may reimburse
the Distributor up to a maximum annual rate of 0.25% of their average daily net
assets.


Under the Plan and as required by Rule 12b-1, the Trustees will receive
and review after the end of each calendar quarter a written report provided by
the Distributor of the amounts expended under the Plan and the purpose for which
such expenditures were made. With the exception of the Distributor and its
affiliates, no "interested person" of the Trust (as that term is defined in the
1940 Act) and no Trustee of the Trust has a direct or indirect financial
interest in the operation of the Plan or any related agreement.


No fee is currently paid by the Funds under the Plan, and pursuant to a
contractual agreement, the Funds will not pay 12b-1 fees anytime before February
4, 2018.


Aggregations. Fund shares in less than Creation Unit Aggregations are not
distributed by the Distributor. The Distributor will deliver the Prospectus and,
upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Unit Aggregations and will
maintain records of both orders placed with it and confirmations of acceptance
furnished by it. The Distributor is a broker-dealer registered under the 1934
Act and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").


The Distribution Agreement provides that it may be terminated at any time,
without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' written notice by the
Trust to the Distributor (i) by vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees;
or (ii) by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined
in the 1940 Act) of the Funds. The Distribution Agreement will terminate
automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).


The Distributor may also enter into agreements with participants that
utilize the facilities of the Depository Trust Company (the "DTC Participants"),
which have international, operational, capabilities and place orders for
Creation Unit Aggregations of Fund shares. Participating Parties (which are
participants in the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities
Clearing Corporation) shall be DTC Participants.


Exchange. The only relationship that the Exchange has with First Trust or
the Distributor of the Funds in connection with the Funds is that the Exchange
will list the shares of the Funds and disseminates the intra-day portfolio
values that are calculated by the IPV Calculator pursuant to its listing
agreement with the Trust. The Exchange is not responsible for and has not
participated in the determination of pricing or the timing of the issuance or


-42-





sale of the shares of the Funds or in the determination or calculation of the
asset value of the Funds. The Exchange has no obligation or liability in
connection with the administration, marketing or trading of the Funds.



ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES



First Trust or its affiliates may from time to time make payments, out of
their own resources, to certain financial intermediaries that sell shares of
First Trust mutual funds and ETFs ("First Trust Funds") to promote the sales and
retention of Fund shares by those firms and their customers. The amounts of
these payments vary by intermediary. The level of payments that First Trust is
willing to provide to a particular intermediary may be affected by, among other
factors, (i) the firm's total assets or Fund shares held in and recent net
investments into First Trust Funds, (ii) the value of the assets invested in the
First Trust Funds by the intermediary's customers, (iii) redemption rates, (iv)
its ability to attract and retain assets, (v) the intermediary's reputation in
the industry, (vi) the level and/or type of marketing assistance and educational
activities provided by the intermediary, (vii) the firm's level of participation
in First Trust Funds' sales and marketing programs, (viii) the firm's
compensation program for its registered representatives who sell Fund shares and
provide services to Fund shareholders, and (ix) the asset class of the First
Trust Funds for which these payments are provided. Such payments are generally
asset-based but also may include the payment of a lump sum.


First Trust may also make payments to certain intermediaries for certain
administrative services and shareholder processing services, including record
keeping and sub-accounting of shareholder accounts pursuant to a sub-transfer
agency, omnibus account service or sub-accounting agreement. All fees payable by
First Trust under this category of services may be charged back to the Fund,
subject to approval by the Board.


First Trust and/or its affiliates may make payments, out of its own
assets, to those firms as compensation and/or reimbursement for marketing
support and/or program servicing to selected intermediaries that are registered
as holders or dealers of record for accounts invested in one or more of the
First Trust Funds or that make First Trust Fund shares available through certain
selected Fund no-transaction fee institutional platforms and fee-based wrap
programs at certain financial intermediaries. Program servicing payments
typically apply to employee benefit plans, such as retirement plans, or
fee-based advisory programs but may apply to retail sales and assets in certain
situations. The payments are based on such factors as the type and nature of
services or support furnished by the intermediary and are generally asset-based.
Services for which an intermediary receives marketing support payments may
include, but are not limited to, business planning assistance, advertising,
educating the intermediary's personnel about First Trust Funds in connection
with shareholder financial planning needs, placement on the intermediary's
preferred or recommended fund list, and access to sales meetings, sales
representatives and management representatives of the intermediary. In addition,
intermediaries may be compensated for enabling representatives of First Trust
and/or its affiliates to participate in and/or present at conferences or
seminars, sales or training programs for invited registered representatives and
other employees, client and investor events and other events sponsored by the
intermediary. Services for which an intermediary receives program servicing
payments typically include, but are not limited to, record keeping, reporting or


-43-





transaction processing and shareholder communications and other account
administration services, but may also include services rendered in connection
with Fund/investment selection and monitoring, employee enrollment and
education, plan balance rollover or separation, or other similar services. An
intermediary may perform program services itself or may arrange with a third
party to perform program services. These payments, if any, are in addition to
the service fee and any applicable omnibus sub-accounting fees paid to these
firms with respect to these services by the First Trust Funds out of Fund
assets.


From time to time, First Trust and/or its affiliates, at its expense, may
provide other compensation to intermediaries that sell or arrange for the sale
of shares of the First Trust Funds, which may be in addition to marketing
support and program servicing payments described above. For example, First Trust
and/or its affiliates may: (i) compensate intermediaries for National Securities
Clearing Corporation networking system services (e.g., shareholder
communication, account statements, trade confirmations and tax reporting) on an
asset-based or per-account basis; (ii) compensate intermediaries for providing
Fund shareholder trading information; (iii) make one-time or periodic payments
to reimburse selected intermediaries for items such as ticket charges (i.e.,
fees that an intermediary charges its representatives for effecting transactions
in Fund shares) or exchange order, operational charges (e.g., fees that an
intermediary charges for establishing the Fund on its trading system) and
literature printing and/or distribution costs; (iv) at the direction of a
retirement plan's sponsor, reimburse or pay direct expenses of an employee
benefit plan that would otherwise be payable by the plan; and (v) provide
payments to broker-dealers to help defray their technology or infrastructure
costs.


When not provided for in a marketing support or program servicing
agreement, First Trust and/ or its affiliates may also pay intermediaries for
enabling First Trust and/or its affiliates to participate in and/or present at
conferences or seminars, sales or training programs for invited registered
representatives and other intermediary employees, client and investor events and
other intermediary-sponsored events, and for travel expenses, including lodging
incurred by registered representatives and other employees in connection with
prospecting, asset retention and due diligence trips. These payments may vary
depending upon the nature of the event. First Trust and/or its affiliates make
payments for such events as it deems appropriate, subject to its internal
guidelines and applicable law.


First Trust and/or its affiliates occasionally sponsor due diligence
meetings for registered representatives during which they receive updates on
various First Trust Funds and are afforded the opportunity to speak with
portfolio managers. Although invitations to these meetings are not conditioned
on selling a specific number of shares, those who have shown an interest in
First Trust Funds are more likely to be considered. To the extent permitted by
their firm's policies and procedures, all or a portion of registered
representatives' expenses in attending these meetings may be covered by First
Trust and/or its affiliates.


The amounts of payments referenced above made by First Trust and/or its
affiliates could be significant and may create an incentive for an intermediary
or its representatives to recommend or offer shares of the First Trust Funds to
its customers. The intermediary may elevate the prominence or profile of the
First Trust Funds within the intermediary's organization by, for example,
placing the First Trust Funds on a list of preferred or recommended funds and/or


-44-





granting First Trust and/or its affiliates preferential or enhanced
opportunities to promote the First Trust Funds in various ways within the
intermediary's organization. These payments are made pursuant to negotiated
agreements with intermediaries. The payments do not change the price paid by
investors for the purchase of a share or the amount the Fund will receive as
proceeds from such sales. Furthermore, many of these payments are not reflected
in the fees and expenses listed in the fee table section of the Funds'
Prospectus because they are not paid by the Fund. The types of payments
described herein are not mutually exclusive, and a single intermediary may
receive some or all types of payments as described.


Other compensation may be offered to the extent not prohibited by state
laws or any self-regulatory agency, such as FINRA. Investors can ask their
intermediaries for information about any payments they receive from First Trust
and/or its affiliates and the services it provides for those payments. Investors
may wish to take intermediary payment arrangements into account when considering
and evaluating any recommendations relating to Fund shares.






ADDITIONAL INFORMATION



Book Entry Only System. The following information supplements and should
be read in conjunction with the Prospectus.


DTC Acts as Securities Depository for Fund Shares. Shares of the Funds are
represented by securities registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company
("DTC") or its nominee, Cede & Co., and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.


DTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was created to hold securities of
its participants (the "DTC Participants") and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions among the DTC Participants in such
securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the DTC
Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities,
or certificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations, some of
whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC. More specifically, DTC is owned by
a number of its DTC Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE")
and FINRA. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as banks,
brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (the
"Indirect Participants").


Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect
Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect
Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such
beneficial interests are referred to herein as "Beneficial Owners") is shown on,
and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by
DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants
(with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC
Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC
Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase and sale of
shares.


-45-





Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to
Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to a letter agreement between
DTC and the Trust, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request
and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of the Funds
held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC
Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or
indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC
Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in
such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably
request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be
transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial
Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participants a fair
and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such
transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.


Fund distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, as the registered
holder of all Fund shares. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such
distributions, shall immediately credit DTC Participants' accounts with payments
in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of
the Funds as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC
Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held
through such DTC Participants will be governed by standing instructions and
customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of
customers in bearer form or registered in a "street name," and will be the
responsibility of such DTC Participants.


The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records
relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of
beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for
any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the
relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and
Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants.


DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares
at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its
responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such
circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to
perform its functions at a comparable cost.


Intra-Day Portfolio Value. The price of a non U.S. security that is
primarily traded on a non U.S. exchange shall be updated every 15 seconds
throughout its trading day, provided, that, upon the closing of such non U.S.
exchange, the closing price of the security will be used throughout the
remainder of the business day where the markets remain open. These exchange
rates may differ from those used by the Sub-Advisor and consequently result in
intra day portfolio values that may vary. Furthermore, in calculating the intra
day portfolio values of the Fund's shares, the exchange rates used throughout
the day (9:00 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., Eastern Time) shall be those that are deemed to
be most appropriate.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES



The Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy that seeks to ensure that
proxies for securities held by the Funds are voted consistently in the best
interests of the Funds.


The Board has delegated to First Trust the proxy voting responsibilities
for the Funds and has directed First Trust to vote proxies consistent with the
Funds' best interests. First Trust has engaged the services of Institutional
Shareholder Services, Inc. ("ISS") to make recommendations to First Trust on the
voting of proxies relating to securities held by the Funds. If First Trust
manages the assets of a company or its pension plan and any of Funds hold any
securities of that company, First Trust will vote proxies relating to such
company's securities in accordance with the ISS recommendations to avoid any
conflict of interest. The First Trust Proxy Voting Guidelines are attached
hereto as Exhibit A and the ISS Proxy Voting Guidelines are attached hereto as
Exhibit B.


Quarterly Portfolio Schedule. The Trust is required to disclose, after its
first and third fiscal quarters, the complete schedule of the Funds' portfolio
holdings with the SEC on Form N-Q. Forms N-Q for the Trust are available on the
SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The Funds' Forms N-Q may also be reviewed
and copied at the SEC's Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. and
information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by
calling 1-800-SEC-0330. The Trust's Forms N-Q are available without charge, upon
request, by calling (800) 621-1675 or by writing to First Trust Portfolios L.P.,
120 East Liberty Drive, Suite 400, Wheaton, Illinois 60187.


Policy Regarding Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings. The Trust has adopted a
policy regarding the disclosure of information about each Fund's portfolio
holdings. The Board of Trustees must approve all material amendments to this
policy. Each Fund's portfolio holdings are publicly disseminated each day the
Fund is open for business through financial reporting and news services,
including publicly accessible Internet websites. In addition, a basket
composition file, which includes the security names and share quantities to
deliver in exchange for Fund shares, together with estimates and actual cash
components, is publicly disseminated each day the NYSE is open for trading via
the National Securities Clearing Corporation ("NSCC"). The basket represents one
Creation Unit of a Fund. Each Fund's portfolio holdings are also available on
the Funds' website at http://www.ftportfolios.com. The Trust, First Trust, FTP,
RIG and BBH will not disseminate non-public information concerning the Trust.


Codes of Ethics. In order to mitigate the possibility that the Funds will
be adversely affected by personal trading, the Trust, First Trust, RIG and the
Distributor have adopted Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act. These
Codes of Ethics contain policies restricting securities trading in personal
accounts of the officers, Trustees and others who normally come into possession
of information on portfolio transactions. Personnel subject to the Codes of
Ethics may invest in securities that may be purchased or held by the Funds;
however, the Codes of Ethics require that each transaction in such securities be
reviewed by the Chief Compliance Officer or his or her designee. These Codes of
Ethics are on public file with, and are available from, the SEC.

CREATION AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNIT AGGREGATIONS



Creation. The Trust issues and sells shares of the Funds only in Creation
Unit Aggregations on a continuous basis through the Distributor, without a sales
load, at their net asset values next determined after receipt, on any Business
Day (as defined below), of an order in proper form.


A "Business Day" is any day on which the NYSE is open for business. As of
the date of this SAI, the NYSE observes the following holidays: New Year's Day,
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.


Deposit of Securities and Deposit or Delivery of Cash. The consideration
for purchase of Creation Unit Aggregations of a Fund may consist of (i) cash in
lieu of all or a portion of the Deposit Securities, as defined below, and/or

(ii) a designated portfolio of securities determined by First Trust--the
"Deposit Securities"--per each Creation Unit Aggregation and generally an amount
of cash--the "Cash Component"--computed as described below. Together, the
Deposit Securities and the Cash Component (including the cash in lieu amount)
constitute the "Fund Deposit," which represents the minimum initial and
subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit Aggregation of the Fund.


The Cash Component is sometimes also referred to as the Balancing Amount.
The Cash Component serves the function of compensating for any differences
between the net asset value per Creation Unit Aggregation and the Deposit Amount
(as defined below). The Cash Component is an amount equal to the difference
between (i) the net asset value of Fund shares (per Creation Unit Aggregation)
and (ii) the "Deposit Amount"--an amount equal to the market value of the
Deposit Securities and/or cash in lieu of all or a portion of the Deposit
Securities. If the Cash Component is a positive number (i.e., the net asset
value per Creation Unit Aggregation exceeds the Deposit Amount), the creator
will deliver the Cash Component. If the Cash Component is a negative number
(i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit Aggregation is less than the
Deposit Amount), the creator will receive the Cash Component.


The Custodian, through the NSCC makes available on each Business Day,
prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern
Time), the list of the names and the required number of shares of each Deposit
Security to be included in the current Fund Deposit (based on information at the
end of the previous Business Day) for the Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable,
subject to any applicable adjustments, in order to effect creations of Creation
Unit Aggregations of a Fund until such time as the next-announced composition of
the Deposit Securities is made available.


The identity and number of shares of the Deposit Securities required for a
Fund Deposit for a Fund change as corporate action events are reflected within a
Fund from time to time by First Trust with a view to the investment objective of
the Fund. In addition, the Trust reserves the right to permit or require the
substitution of an amount of cash--i.e., a "cash in lieu" amount--to be added to
the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security that may not be available,
that may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery or that might not


-48-





be eligible for trading by an Authorized Participant (as defined below) or the
investor for which it is acting or other relevant reason. The Trust also
reserves the right to permit or require, under certain circumstances, the
substitution of a different security in lieu of depositing some or all of the
Deposit Securities The adjustments described above will reflect changes known to
First Trust on the date of announcement to be in effect by the time of delivery
of the Fund Deposit or resulting from certain corporate actions.


In addition to the list of names and numbers of securities constituting
the current Deposit Securities of a Fund Deposit, the Custodian, through the
NSCC, also makes available on each Business Day, the estimated Cash Component,
for the current day as well as the Cash Component for the previous Business Day,
per outstanding Creation Unit Aggregation of a Fund.


Procedures for Creation of Creation Unit Aggregations. In order to be
eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit
Aggregation of a Fund, an entity must be a DTC Participant (see the section
entitled "Book Entry Only System"), must have executed an agreement with the
Distributor and transfer agent, with respect to creations and redemptions of
Creation Unit Aggregations ("Participant Agreement"), and must have
international operational capabilities. A DTC Participant is also referred to as
an "Authorized Participant." Investors should contact the Distributor for the
names of Authorized Participants that have signed a Participant Agreement. All
Fund shares, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name
of Cede & Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.


All standard orders to create Creation Unit Aggregations must be received
by the transfer agent no later than the closing time of the regular trading
session on the NYSE ("Closing Time") (ordinarily 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) in
each case on the date such order is placed in order for the creation of Creation
Unit Aggregations to be effected based on the net asset value of shares of the
Funds as next determined on such date after receipt of the order in proper form.
Subject to the provisions of the applicable Participant Agreement, in the case
of custom orders, the order must generally be received by the transfer agent no
later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the trade date. A custom order may be
placed by an Authorized Participant in the event that the Trust permits or
requires the substitution of an amount of cash to be added to the Cash Component
to replace any Deposit Security which may not be available, which may not be
available in sufficient quantity for delivery or which may not be eligible for
trading by such Authorized Participant or the investor for which it is acting or
other relevant reason. The date on which an order to create Creation Unit
Aggregations (or an order to redeem Creation Unit Aggregations, as discussed
below) is placed is referred to as the "Transmittal Date." Orders must be
transmitted by an Authorized Participant by telephone or other transmission
method acceptable to the transfer agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the
Participant Agreement. Severe economic or market disruptions or changes, or
telephone or other communications failure may impede the ability to reach the
transfer agent or an Authorized Participant.


All orders from investors who are not Authorized Participants to create
Creation Unit Aggregations shall be placed with an Authorized Participant, as
applicable, in the form required by such Authorized Participant. In addition,
the Authorized Participant may request the investor to make certain
representations or enter into agreements with respect to the order, e.g., to
provide for payments of cash, when required. Investors should be aware that


-49-





their particular broker may not have executed a Participant Agreement and that,
therefore, orders to create Creation Unit Aggregations of a Fund have to be
placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant that has
executed a Participant Agreement. In such cases there may be additional charges
to such investor. At any given time, there may be only a limited number of
broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement. Those persons placing
orders should ascertain the deadlines applicable to DTC and the Federal Reserve
Bank wire system by contacting the operations department of the broker or
depository institution effectuating such transfer of Deposit Securities and Cash
Component.


Deposit Securities must be delivered to the Trust through DTC or NSCC,
subject to and in accordance with the applicable provisions set forth in the
Participant Agreement and Deposit Securities that are non-U.S. securities must
be delivered to an account maintained at the applicable local subcustodian of
the Trust on or before the International Contractual Settlement Date, as defined
below all in accordance with the terms of the Participant Agreement. If a
Deposit Security is an ADR or similar domestic instrument, it may be delivered
to the Custodian. The Authorized Participant must also pay on or before the
International Contractual Settlement Date immediately available or same-day
funds estimated by Trust to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next
determined after acceptance of the creation order, together with the applicable
Creation Transaction Fee (as defined below) and, if applicable, any operational
processing and brokerage costs, transfer fees or stamp taxes. The "International
Contractual Settlement Date" is the earlier of (i) the date upon which all of
the required Deposit Securities, the Cash Component and any other cash amounts
which may be due are delivered to the Funds or (ii) the latest day for
settlement on the customary settlement cycle in the jurisdiction(s) where any of
the securities of such Fund are customarily traded. Any excess funds will be
returned following settlement of the issue of the Creation Unit Aggregation.


Issuance of Creation Unit Aggregations. A Creation Unit Aggregation will
generally not be issued until the transfer of good title to the Trust of the
portfolio of Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component, the
payment of the Creation Transaction Fee (as defined below) and the payment of
any other required cash amounts have been completed. When the required Deposit
Securities which are U.S. securities have been delivered to the Trust through
DTC or NSCC, and each relevant subcustodian confirms to Custodian that the
required Deposit Securities which are non-U.S. securities (or, when permitted in
the sole discretion of Trust, the cash in lieu thereof) have been delivered to
the account of the relevant subcustodian, the Custodian shall notify the
Distributor and the transfer agent which, acting on behalf of the Trust, will
issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit Aggregations. The Trust may in
its sole discretion permit or require the substitution of an amount of cash
(i.e., a "cash in lieu" amount) to be added to the Cash Component to replace any
Deposit Security which may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery
or for other relevant reasons. If the Distributor, acting on behalf of the
Trust, determines that a "cash in lieu" amount will be accepted, the Distributor
will notify the Authorized Participant and the transfer agent, and the
Authorized Participant shall deliver, on behalf of itself or the party on whose
behalf it is acting, the "cash in lieu" amount, with any appropriate adjustments
as advised by the Trust.


In the event that an order for a Creation Unit is incomplete because
certain or all of the Deposit Securities are missing, the Trust may issue a
Creation Unit notwithstanding such deficiency in reliance on the undertaking of


-50-





the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as
possible, which undertaking shall be secured by an additional cash deposit
(described below) with respect to the undelivered Deposit Securities. To the
extent contemplated by the applicable Participant Agreement, Creation Unit
Aggregations of the Funds will be issued to such Authorized Participant
notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been
received in part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized
Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which
undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and
maintenance of collateral consisting of cash in the form of U.S. dollars in
immediately available funds having a value (marked to market daily) at least
equal to 115% which First Trust may change from time to time of the value of the
missing Deposit Securities. The Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to
buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized
Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Trust of
purchasing such securities and the value of the collateral.


Acceptance of Orders for Creation Unit Aggregations. The Trust reserves
the absolute right to reject a creation order transmitted to it by the
Distributor with respect to a Fund if: (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii)
the investor(s), upon obtaining the Fund shares ordered, would own 80% or more
of the currently outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the required Fund Deposit
is not delivered; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would have certain
adverse tax consequences to the Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would,
in the opinion of the Trust, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit
would otherwise have an adverse effect on the Trust, the Fund or the rights of
Beneficial Owners; or (vii) circumstances outside the control of the Trust or
the Fund make it impossible to process creation orders for all practical
purposes. Examples of such circumstances include: acts of God or public service
or utility problems such as fires, floods, extreme weather conditions and power
outages resulting in telephone, telecopy and computer failures; market
conditions or activities causing trading halts; systems failures involving
computer or other information systems affecting the Fund, the Trust, First
Trust, the Distributor, the transfer agent, DTC, NSCC, the Custodian or
sub-custodian or any other participant in the creation process; the imposition
by a foreign government or a regulatory body of controls, or other monetary,
currency or trading restrictions that directly affect the portfolio securities
held; and similar extraordinary events. The Distributor shall notify a
prospective creator of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting
on behalf of such prospective creator of its rejection of the order of such
person. The Trust, the Custodian, any sub-custodian and the Distributor are
under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in
the delivery of Fund Deposits, nor shall any of them incur any liability for the
failure to give any such notification.


All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit
Securities and the validity, form, eligibility, and acceptance for deposit of
any securities to be delivered shall be determined by the Trust, and the Trust's
determination shall be final and binding.


Creation Transaction Fee. Purchasers of Creation Units must pay a creation
transaction fee (the "Creation Transaction Fee") that is currently $2,600 for
the First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Asia Pacific ETF, $6,000 for the First Trust
RiverFront Dynamic Europe ETF and $8,600 for the First Trust RiverFront Dynamic
Developed International ETF. The Creation Transaction Fee is applicable to each


-51-





purchase transaction regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased in the
transaction. The Creation Transaction Fee may vary and is based on the
composition of the securities included in the Funds' portfolio and the countries
in which the transactions are settled. The price for each Creation Unit will
equal the daily net asset value per share times the number of shares in a
Creation Unit plus the fees described above and, if applicable, any operational
processing and brokerage costs, transfer fees or stamp taxes. When a Fund
permits an Authorized Participant to substitute cash or a different security in
lieu of depositing one or more of the requisite Deposit Securities, the
Authorized Participant may also be assessed an amount to cover the cost of
purchasing the Deposit Securities and/or disposing of the substituted
securities, including operational processing and brokerage costs, transfer fees,
stamp taxes, and part or all of the spread between the expected bid and offer
side of the market related to such Deposit Securities and/or substitute
securities.


As discussed above, shares of a Fund may be issued in advance of receipt
of all Deposit Securities subject to various conditions including a requirement
to maintain on deposit with a Fund cash at least equal to 115% of the market
value of the missing Deposit Securities.


Redemption of Fund Shares in Creation Unit Aggregations. Fund shares may
be redeemed only in Creation Unit Aggregations at their net asset value next
determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by a Fund
through the transfer agent and only on a Business Day. A Fund will not redeem
shares in amounts less than Creation Unit Aggregations. Beneficial Owners must
accumulate enough shares in the secondary market to constitute a Creation Unit
Aggregation in order to have such shares redeemed by the Trust. Shares generally
will be redeemed in Creation Unit Aggregations in exchange for a particular
portfolio of securities ("Fund Securities"), although the Funds have the right
to make redemption payments in cash, in-kind or a combination of each. There can
be no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the public
trading market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit Aggregation.
Investors should expect to incur customary brokerage and other costs in
connection with assembling a sufficient number of Fund shares to constitute a
redeemable Creation Unit Aggregation.


With respect to the Funds, the Custodian, through the NSCC, makes
available prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m.
Eastern Time) on each Business Day, the identity of the Fund Securities that
will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption
requests received in proper form on that day. Fund Securities received on
redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to
creations of Creation Unit Aggregations.


Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund (as
discussed below), the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit Aggregation
generally consist of Fund Securities--as announced on the Business Day of the
request for redemption received in proper form--plus or minus cash in an amount
equal to the difference between the net asset value of the Creation Unit
Aggregation being redeemed, as next determined after a receipt of a request in
proper form, and the value of the Fund Securities (the "Cash Redemption
Amount"), less the applicable Redemption Transaction Fee as listed below and, if
applicable, any operational processing and brokerage costs, transfer fees or
stamp taxes. In the event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the


-52-





net asset value of the Fund shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the
difference plus, the applicable Redemption Transaction Fee and, if applicable,
any operational processing and brokerage costs, transfer fees or stamp taxes is
required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming
shareholder.


The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed

(i) for any period during which the NYSE is closed (other than customary weekend
and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during which trading on the NYSE is
suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists
as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund or determination of the
Fund's net asset value is not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other
circumstances as are permitted by the SEC.


Redemption Transaction Fee. Parties redeeming Creation Units must pay a
redemption transaction fee (the "Redemption Transaction Fee") that is currently
$2,600 for the First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Asia Pacific ETF, $6,000 for the
First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Europe ETF and $8,600 for the First Trust
RiverFront Dynamic Developed International ETF. The Redemption Transaction Fee
is applicable to each redemption transaction regardless of the number of
Creation Units redeemed in the transaction. The Redemption Transaction Fee may
vary and is based on the composition of the securities included in a Fund's
portfolio and the countries in which the transactions are settled. Investors
will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from the Trust to
their account or on their order and may also be assessed an amount to cover
other costs including operational processing and brokerage costs, transfer fees,
stamp taxes and part or all of the spread between the expected bid and offer
side of the market related to such securities. Investors who use the services of
a broker or other such intermediary in addition to an Authorized Participant to
effect a redemption of a Creation Unit Aggregation may also be assessed an
amount to cover the cost of such services.


Placement of Redemption Orders. Orders to redeem Creation Unit
Aggregations must be delivered through an Authorized Participant that has
executed a Participant Agreement and must comply with the applicable provisions
of such Participant Agreement. Investors other than APs are responsible for
making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized
Participant. An order to redeem Creation Unit Aggregations of a Fund is deemed
received by the Trust on the Transmittal Date if: (i) such order is received by
BBH (in its capacity as transfer agent) not later than the Closing Time on the
Transmittal Date; (ii) such order is accompanied or followed by the requisite
number of shares of a Fund specified in such order, which delivery must be made
through DTC to BBH; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Participant
Agreement are properly followed.


Deliveries of Fund Securities to investors are generally expected to be
made within three business days. Due to the schedule of holidays in certain
countries, however, the delivery of in-kind redemption proceeds for the Fund may
take longer than three Business Days after the day on which the redemption
request is received in proper form. In such cases, the local market settlement
procedures will not commence until the end of the local holiday periods. See
below for a list of the local holidays in the foreign countries relevant to the
Fund. Under the 1940 Act, the Fund would generally be required to make payment
of redemption proceeds within seven days after a security is tendered for
redemption. However, because the settlement of redemptions of Fund Shares is


-53-





contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the United States securities
markets, but also on delivery cycles of foreign markets, pursuant to an
exemptive order on which the Fund may rely, the Fund's in-kind redemption
proceeds must be paid within the maximum number of calendar days required for
such payment or satisfaction in the principal local markets where transactions
in portfolio securities customarily clear and settle, but generally no later
than twelve calendar days following tender of a Creation Unit Aggregation.


In connection with taking delivery of shares of non-U.S. Fund Securities
upon redemption of shares of the Fund, a redeeming Beneficial Owner, or AP
acting on behalf of such Beneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate security
arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody provider in
each jurisdiction in which any of the Fund Securities are customarily traded, to
which account such Fund Securities will be delivered.


To the extent contemplated by a Participant Agreement, in the event the
Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is
unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Unit Aggregation to be redeemed
to the Funds' transfer agent, the transfer agent may nonetheless accept the
redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the Authorized Participant
to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be
secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral
consisting of cash having a value (marked to market daily) at least equal to
115%, which First Trust may change from time to time, of the value of the
missing shares.


The current procedures for collateralization of missing shares require,
among other things, that any cash collateral shall be in the form of U.S.
dollars in immediately available funds and shall be held by BBH and marked to
market daily, and that the fees of BBH and any sub-custodians in respect of the
delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the cash collateral shall be payable by
the Authorized Participant. If the Participant Agreement provides for
collateralization, it will permit the Trust, on behalf of the affected Fund, to
purchase the missing shares at any time and will subject the Authorized
Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Trust of
purchasing such shares and the value of the collateral.


The calculation of the value of the Fund Securities and the Cash
Redemption Amount to be delivered/received upon redemption will be made by BBH
according to the procedures set forth in this SAI under "Determination of Net
Asset Value" computed on the Business Day on which a redemption order is deemed
received by the Trust. Therefore, if a redemption order in proper form is
submitted to BBH by a DTC Participant not later than Closing Time on the
Transmittal Date, and the requisite number of shares of the Fund are delivered
to BBH prior to the specified time, then the value of the Fund Securities and
the Cash Redemption Amount to be delivered will be determined by BBH on such
Transmittal Date. If, however, a redemption order is submitted to BBH by a DTC
Participant not later than the Closing Time on the Transmittal Date but either

(i) the requisite number of shares of the relevant Fund are not delivered by the
specified time, as described above, on such Transmittal Date, or (ii) the
redemption order is not submitted in proper form, then the redemption order will
not be deemed received as of the Transmittal Date. In such case, the value of
the Fund Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be delivered/received will
be computed on the Business Day that such order is deemed received by the Trust,


-54-





i.e., the Business Day on which the shares of the Fund are delivered through DTC
to BBH by the specified time on such Business Day pursuant to a properly
submitted redemption order.


If it is not possible to effect deliveries of the Fund Securities, the
Trust may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such Fund shares in
cash, and the redeeming Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its
redemption proceeds in cash. In addition, an investor may request a redemption
in cash that the Fund may, in its sole discretion, permit. In either case, the
investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its Fund
shares based on the net asset value of shares of the relevant Fund next
determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a
redemption transaction fee and additional charges for requested cash redemptions
specified above, to offset the Trust's brokerage and other transaction costs
associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). A Fund may also, in its
sole discretion, upon request of a shareholder, provide such redeemer cash in
lieu of some securities added to the Cash Redemption Amount, but in no event
will the total value of the securities delivered and the cash transmitted differ
from the net asset value.


Redemptions of Fund shares for Fund Securities will be subject to
compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and the Fund
(whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to
redeem Creation Unit Aggregations for cash to the extent that the Trust could
not lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or could not do
so without first registering the Fund Securities under such laws. An Authorized
Participant or an investor for which it is acting subject to a legal restriction
with respect to a particular stock included in the Fund Securities applicable to
the redemption of a Creation Unit Aggregation may be paid an equivalent amount
of cash. The Authorized Participant may request the redeeming Beneficial Owner
of the Fund shares to complete an order form or to enter into agreements with
respect to such matters as compensating cash payment, beneficial ownership of
shares or delivery instructions.


Because the portfolio securities of the Funds may trade on the relevant
exchange(s) on days that the listing exchange for a Fund is closed or that are
otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to
redeem their shares of such Fund, or purchase and sell shares of such Fund on
the listing exchange for a Fund, on days when the net asset value of such Fund
could be significantly affected by events in the relevant foreign markets.



REGULAR HOLIDAYS



Each Fund generally intends to effect deliveries of Creation Units and
securities in its portfolio ("Portfolio Securities") on a basis of "T" plus
three Business Days (i.e., days on which the NYSE is open). A Fund may effect
deliveries of Creation Units and Portfolio Securities on a basis other than "T"
plus three in order to accommodate local holiday schedules, to account for
different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and
ex-dividend dates, or under certain other circumstances. The ability of the
Trust to effect in-kind creations and redemptions within three Business Days of
receipt of an order in good form is subject, among other things, to the
condition that, within the time period from the date of the order to the date of
delivery of the securities, there are no days that are holidays in the
applicable foreign market. For every occurrence of one or more intervening
holidays in the applicable non-U.S. market that are not holidays observed in the


-55-





U.S. equity market, the redemption settlement cycle will be extended by the
number of such intervening holidays. In addition to holidays, other
unforeseeable closings in a non-U.S. market due to emergencies may also prevent
the Trust from delivering securities within the normal settlement period.


The longest redemption cycle for a Fund is a function of the longest
redemption cycle among the countries whose securities comprise the Fund. The
securities delivery cycles currently practicable for transferring Portfolio
Securities to redeeming investors, coupled with non-U.S. market holiday
schedules, will require a delivery process longer than seven calendar days for
some Fund in certain circumstances. In no event, however, will the Fund take
more than twelve calendar days from the date of the tender to deliver the
redemption proceeds. The holidays applicable to a Fund during such periods are
listed below. Certain holidays may occur on different dates in subsequent years.
The proclamation of new holidays, the treatment by market participants of
certain days as "informal holidays" (e.g., days on which no or limited
securities transactions occur, as a result of substantially shortened trading
hours), the elimination of existing holidays, or changes in local securities
delivery practices, could affect the information set forth herein at some time
in the future.


The dates of the regular holidays affecting the relevant securities
markets from April 2016 through March 2017 of the below-listed countries are as
follows:

FEDERAL TAX MATTERS



This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning shares of a Fund. This section is current as of the date
of the SAI. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these
summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a
non-U.S. person, a broker-dealer, or other investor with special circumstances.
In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax
consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel
to the Funds. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review, and
has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of
the assets to be deposited in the Funds. This may not be sufficient for
prospective investors to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal
tax law.


As with any investment, prospective investors should seek advice based on
their individual circumstances from their own tax advisor.


Each Fund intends to qualify annually and to elect to be treated as a
regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code").


To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, each Fund must, among other things,

(i) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or
currencies, or net income derived from interests in certain publicly traded
partnerships; (ii) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of
the taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund's assets is
represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government
securities, the securities of other regulated investment companies and other
securities, with such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for
the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value
of each Fund's total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting
securities of such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total
assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or
the securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or


-59-





two or more issuers which a Fund controls which are engaged in the same, similar
or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more of certain
publicly traded partnerships; and (iii) distribute at least 90% of its
investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends,
interest and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital
losses) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income each taxable
year. There are certain exceptions for failure to qualify if the failure is for
reasonable cause or is de minimis, and certain corrective action is taken and
certain tax payments are made by the Fund.


As a regulated investment company, the Funds generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on their investment company taxable income (as that
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net
short-term capital loss), if any, that they distribute to shareholders. Each
Fund intends to distribute to its shareholders, at least annually, substantially
all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If a Fund
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, each Fund distributes during each
calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its ordinary
income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar
year, (2) at least 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses
(adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31
of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains for previous
years that were not distributed during those years. In order to prevent
application of the excise tax, the Funds intend to make its distributions in
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. A distribution will
be treated as paid on December 31 of the current calendar year if it is declared
by a Fund in October, November or December with a record date in such a month
and paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year. Such
distributions will be taxable to shareholders in the calendar year in which the
distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the
distributions are received.


Subject to certain reasonable cause and de minimis exceptions, if a Fund
fails to qualify as a regulated investment company or fails to satisfy the 90%
distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Fund would be taxed as an
ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income were distributed
to its shareholders) and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be
taxed to shareholders as ordinary income.



DISTRIBUTIONS



Dividends paid out of the Funds' investment company taxable income are
generally taxable to a shareholder as ordinary income to the extent of the
Fund's earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional
shares. However, certain ordinary income distributions received from a Fund may
be taxed at capital gains tax rates. In particular, ordinary income dividends
received by an individual shareholder from a regulated investment company such
as the Fund are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital
gain, provided that certain holding period requirements are satisfied and
provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the
Fund itself. Dividends received by the Fund from REITs and foreign corporations


-60-





are qualifying dividends eligible for this lower tax rate only in certain
circumstances. The Fund will provide notice to its shareholders of the amount of
any distributions that may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible
for the capital gains tax rates. The Fund cannot make any guarantees as to the
amount of any distribution which will be regarded as a qualifying dividend.


Income from a Fund may also be subject to a 3.8% "Medicare tax." This tax
generally applies to net investment income if the taxpayer's adjusted gross
income exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of
married couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single
individuals.


A corporation that owns shares generally will not be entitled to the
dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the
Funds because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for
distributions from regulated investment companies. However, certain ordinary
income dividends on shares that are attributable to qualifying dividends
received by the Funds from certain domestic corporations may be reported by the
Funds as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.


Distributions of net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital
gain over net short-term capital loss), if any, properly reported as capital
gain dividends are taxable to a shareholder as long-term capital gains,
regardless of how long the shareholder has held Fund shares. Shareholders
receiving distributions in the form of additional shares, rather than cash,
generally will have a tax basis in each such share equal to the value of a share
of a Fund on the reinvestment date. A distribution of an amount in excess of a
Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated by a
shareholder as a return of capital which is applied against and reduces the
shareholder's basis in his or her shares. To the extent that the amount of any
such distribution exceeds the shareholder's basis in his or her shares, the
excess will be treated by the shareholder as gain from a sale or exchange of the
shares.


Shareholders will be notified annually as to the U.S. federal income tax
status of distributions, and shareholders receiving distributions in the form of
additional shares will receive a report as to the value of those shares.



SALE OR EXCHANGE OF FUND SHARES



Upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Funds, which a
shareholder holds as a capital asset, such shareholder may realize a capital
gain or loss which will be long-term or short-term, depending upon the
shareholder's holding period for the shares. Generally, a shareholder's gain or
loss will be a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than
one year.


Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent
that shares disposed of are replaced (including through reinvestment of
dividends) within a period of 61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30
days after disposition of shares or to the extent that the shareholder, during
such period, acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire,
substantially identical stock or securities. In such a case, the basis of the


-61-





shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss
realized by a shareholder on a disposition of Fund shares held by the
shareholder for six months or less will be treated as a long-term capital loss
to the extent of any distributions of long-term capital gain received by the
shareholder with respect to such shares.






TAXES ON PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS



If a shareholder exchanges equity securities for Creation Units, the
shareholder will generally recognize a gain or a loss. The gain or loss will be
equal to the difference between the market value of the Creation Units at the
time and the shareholder's aggregate basis in the securities surrendered and the
Cash Component paid. If a shareholder exchanges Creation Units for equity
securities, then the shareholder will generally recognize a gain or loss equal
to the difference between the shareholder's basis in the Creation Units and the
aggregate market value of the securities received and the Cash Redemption
Amount. The Internal Revenue Service, however, may assert that a loss realized
upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units or Creation Units for
securities cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing "wash sales,"
or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position.



NATURE OF FUNDS' INVESTMENTS



Certain of the Funds' investment practices are subject to special and
complex federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i)
disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or
deductions, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed
short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a
deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv)
cause the Funds to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of
cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or
securities is deemed to occur and (vi) adversely alter the characterization of
certain complex financial transactions.



FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS



The Funds' transactions in futures contracts and options will be subject
to special provisions of the Code that, among other things, may affect the
character of gains and losses realized by the Funds (i.e., may affect whether
gains or losses are ordinary or capital, or short-term or long-term), may
accelerate recognition of income to the Funds and may defer Fund losses. These
rules could, therefore, affect the character, amount and timing of distributions
to shareholders. These provisions also (i) will require the Funds to
mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (i.e., treat them
as if they were closed out); and (ii) may cause the Funds to recognize income
without receiving cash with which to make distributions in amounts necessary to
satisfy the 90% distribution requirement for qualifying to be taxed as a
regulated investment company and the distribution requirements for avoiding
excise taxes.


-62-






INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN CORPORATIONS



If a Fund holds an equity interest in any PFICs, which are generally
certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual gross
income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, certain rents and
royalties or capital gains) or that hold at least 50% of their assets in
investments producing such passive income, the Fund could be subject to U.S.
federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain
distributions with respect to those equity interests, even if all the income or
gain is timely distributed to its shareholders. A Fund will not be able to pass
through to its shareholders any credit or deduction for such taxes. A Fund may
be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax
consequences. In this case, a Fund would recognize as ordinary income any
increase in the value of such PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in
such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income.
Under this election, a Fund might be required to recognize in a year income in
excess of its distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of
PFIC stock during that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to
the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the
4% excise tax (described above). Dividends paid by PFICs are not treated as
qualified dividend income.



BACKUP WITHHOLDING



The Funds may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax from all
taxable distributions and sale proceeds payable to shareholders who fail to
provide the Funds with their correct taxpayer identification number or fail to
make required certifications, or who have been notified by the Internal Revenue
Service that they are subject to backup withholding. Corporate shareholders and
certain other shareholders specified in the Code generally are exempt from such
backup withholding. This withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld may be credited against the shareholder's U.S. federal income tax
liability.



NON-U.S. SHAREHOLDERS



U.S. taxation of a shareholder who, as to the United States, is a
nonresident alien individual, a foreign trust or estate, a foreign corporation
or foreign partnership ("non-U.S. shareholder") depends on whether the income of
a Fund is "effectively connected" with a U.S. trade or business carried on by
the shareholder.


In addition to the rules described in this section concerning the
potential imposition of withholding on distributions to non-U.S. persons,
distributions to non-U.S. persons that are "financial institutions" may be
subject to a withholding tax of 30% unless an agreement is in place between the
financial institution and the U.S. Treasury to collect and disclose information
about accounts, equity investments, or debt interests in the financial
institution held by one or more U.S. persons or the institution is resident in a
jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the U.S. Treasury. For
these purposes, a "financial institution" means any entity that (i) accepts
deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business, (ii) holds
financial assets for the account of others as a substantial portion of its
business, or (iii) is engaged (or holds itself out as being engaged) primarily
in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, partnership
interests, commodities or any interest (including a futures contract or option)


-63-





in such securities, partnership interests or commodities. Dispositions of shares
by such persons may be subject to such withholding after December 31, 2018.


Distributions to non-financial non-U.S. entities (other than publicly
traded foreign entities, entities owned by residents of U.S. possessions,
foreign governments, international organizations, or foreign central banks) will
also be subject to a withholding tax of 30% if the entity does not certify that
the entity does not have any substantial U.S. owners or provide the name,
address and TIN of each substantial U.S. owner. Dispositions of shares by such
persons may be subject to such withholding after December 31, 2018.


Income Not Effectively Connected. If the income from a Fund is not
"effectively connected" with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the non-U.S.
shareholder, distributions of investment company taxable income will generally
be subject to a U.S. tax of 30% (or lower treaty rate), which tax is generally
withheld from such distributions.


Distributions of capital gain dividends and any amounts retained by a Fund
which are properly reported by the Fund as undistributed capital gains will not
be subject to U.S. tax at the rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate) unless the
non-U.S. shareholder is a nonresident alien individual and is physically present
in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year and meets
certain other requirements. However, this 30% tax on capital gains of
nonresident alien individuals who are physically present in the United States
for more than the 182 day period only applies in exceptional cases because any
individual present in the United States for more than 182 days during the
taxable year is generally treated as a resident for U.S. income tax purposes; in
that case, he or she would be subject to U.S. income tax on his or her worldwide
income at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, rather than the 30%
U.S. tax. In the case of a non-U.S. shareholder who is a nonresident alien
individual, the Funds may be required to withhold U.S. income tax from
distributions of net capital gain unless the non-U.S. shareholder certifies his
or her non-U.S. status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an
exemption. If a non-U.S. shareholder is a nonresident alien individual, any gain
such shareholder realizes upon the sale or exchange of such shareholder's shares
of the Funds in the United States will ordinarily be exempt from U.S. tax unless
the gain is U.S. source income and such shareholder is physically present in the
United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year and meets certain
other requirements. In addition, capital gains distributions attributable to
gains from U.S. real property interests (including certain U.S. real property
holding corporations) will generally be subject to United States withholding tax
and will give rise to an obligation on the part of the foreign shareholder to
file a United States tax return.


Income Effectively Connected. If the income from a Fund is "effectively
connected" with a U.S. trade or business carried on by a non-U.S. shareholder,
then distributions of investment company taxable income and capital gain
dividends, any amounts retained by a Fund which are properly reported by a Fund
as undistributed capital gains and any gains realized upon the sale or exchange
of shares of the Funds will be subject to U.S. income tax at the graduated rates
applicable to U.S. citizens, residents and domestic corporations. Non-U.S.
corporate shareholders may also be subject to the branch profits tax imposed by
the Code. The tax consequences to a non-U.S. shareholder entitled to claim the
benefits of an applicable tax treaty may differ from those described herein.


-64-





Non-U.S. shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect
to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Funds.



CAPITAL LOSS CARRY-FORWARD



Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the "RIC
Modernization Act"), net capital losses of the Fund may be carried forward
indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term and/or long-term
losses. To the extent that these loss carry-forwards are used to offset future
capital gains, it is probable that the capital gains so offset will not be
distributed to Fund shareholders. The Fund is subject to certain limitations,
under U.S. tax rules, on the use of capital loss carry-forwards and net
unrealized built-in losses. These limitations apply when there has been a 50%
change in ownership.



OTHER TAXATION



Fund shareholders may be subject to state, local and foreign taxes on
their Fund distributions. Shareholders are advised to consult their own tax
advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an
investment in the Funds.






DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE



The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction
with the section in the Prospectus entitled "Net Asset Value."


The per-share net asset value of a Fund is determined by dividing the
total value of the securities and other assets, less liabilities, by the total
number of shares outstanding. Under normal circumstances, daily calculation of
the net asset value will utilize the last closing sale price of each security
held by a Fund at the close of the market on which such security is principally
listed. In determining net asset value, portfolio securities for a Fund for
which accurate market quotations are readily available will be valued by the
Fund accounting agent as follows:


(1) Common stocks and other equity securities listed on any national
or foreign exchange other than Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange
Alternative Investment Market ("AIM") will be valued at the last sale
price on the exchange on which they are principally traded, or the
official closing price for Nasdaq and AIM securities. Portfolio securities
traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale
price or official closing price, as applicable, on the Business Day as of
which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange
representing the principal market for such securities.


(2) Shares of open-end mutual funds are valued at fair value which
is based on NAV per share.


-65-





(3) Securities traded in the OTC market are fair valued at the mean
of their most recent bid and asked price, if available, and otherwise at
their closing bid price.


(4) Exchange traded options and futures contracts are valued at the
closing price in the market where such contracts are principally traded.
If no closing price is available, they will be fair valued at the mean of
their most recent bid and asked price, if available, and otherwise at
their closing bid price. OTC options and futures contracts are fair valued
at the mean of their most recent bid and asked price, if available, and
otherwise at their closing bid price.


(5) Forward foreign currency contracts are fair valued at the
current day's interpolated foreign exchange rate, as calculated using the
current day's spot rate, and the 30, 60, 90 and 180-day forward rates
provided by a pricing service or by certain independent dealers in such
contracts.


In addition, the following types of securities will be fair valued by the
Fund accounting agent as follows:


(1) Fixed-income securities, interest rate swaps, credit default
swaps, total return swaps, currency swaps, currency-linked notes,
credit-linked notes and other similar instruments will be fair valued
using a pricing service.


(2) Fixed income and other debt securities having a remaining
maturity of 60 days or less when purchased are fair valued at cost
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
(amortized cost), provided the Advisor's Pricing Committee has determined
that the use of amortized cost is an appropriate reflection of fair value
given market and issuer-specific conditions existing at the time of the
determination. Factors that may be considered in determining the
appropriateness of the use of amortized cost include, but are not limited
to, the following:


(i)   the credit conditions in the relevant market and changes
thereto;


(ii)  the liquidity conditions in the relevant market and changes
thereto;


(iii) the interest rate conditions in the relevant market and
changes thereto (such as significant changes in interest
rates);


(iv)  issuer-specific conditions (such as significant credit
deterioration); and


(v)   any other market-based data the Advisor's Pricing Committee
considers relevant. In this regard, the Advisor's Pricing
Committee may use last-obtained market-based data to assist it
when valuing portfolio securities using amortized cost.


-66-





(3) Repurchase agreements will be valued as follows. Overnight
repurchase agreements will be fair valued at amortized cost when it
represents the best estimate of fair value. Term repurchase agreements
(i.e., those whose maturity exceeds seven days) will be fair valued by the
Advisor's Pricing Committee at the average of the bid quotations obtained
daily from at least two recognized dealers.


If the Advisor's Pricing Committee has reason to question the accuracy or
reliability of a price supplied or the use of the amortized cost methodology,
the Advisor's Pricing Committee shall determine if "it needs to fair value" such
portfolio security pursuant to established valuation procedures. From time to
time, the Advisor's Pricing Committee will request that the Fund accounting
agent submit price challenges to a pricing service, usually in response to any
updated broker prices received.


Certain securities may not be able to be priced by pre-established pricing
methods. Such securities may be valued by the Board of Trustees or its delegate,
the Advisor's Pricing Committee, at fair value. These securities generally
include but are not limited to, restricted securities (securities that may not
be publicly sold without registration under the 1933 Act) for which a pricing
service is unable to provide a market price; securities whose trading has been
formally suspended; a security whose market or fair value price is not available
from a pre-established pricing source; a security with respect to which an event
has occurred that is likely to materially affect the value of the security after
the market has closed but before the calculation of Fund net asset value (as may
be the case in foreign markets on which the security is primarily traded) or is
likely to make it difficult or impossible to obtain a reliable market quotation;
and a security whose price, as provided by the pricing service, does not reflect
the security's fair value. Fair value prices represent any prices not considered
market value prices and are either obtained from a pricing service or are
determined by the Advisor's Pricing Committee. Market value prices represent
last sale or official closing prices from a national or foreign exchange (i.e.,
a regulated market) and are primarily obtained from pricing services. If no
market price or official close price is available from either a pricing service
or no quotations are available from one or more brokers or if the Advisor's
Pricing Committee has reason to question the reliability or accuracy of a price
supplied or the use of amortized cost, the value of any portfolio security held
by a Fund for which reliable market prices/quotations are not readily available
will be determined by the Advisor's Pricing Committee in a manner that most
appropriately reflects fair market value of the security on the valuation date,
based on a consideration of all available information. When fair value prices
are used, generally they will differ from market quotations or official closing
prices on the applicable exchange.


Because foreign markets may be open on different days than the days during
which a shareholder may purchase the shares of a Fund, the value of a Fund's
investments may change on the days when shareholders are not able to purchase
the shares of the Funds. For foreign securities, if an extraordinary market
event occurs between the time the last "current" market quotation is available
for a security in a Fund's portfolio and the time the Fund's net asset value is
determined and calls into doubt whether that earlier market quotation represents
fair value at the time the Fund's net asset value is determined, the Fund
accounting agent will immediately notify the Advisor's Pricing Committee and the
Advisor's Pricing Committee shall determine the fair valuation. For foreign


-67-





securities, the Advisor's Pricing Committee may seek to determine the "fair
value" of such securities by retaining a pricing service to determine the value
of the securities.


Foreign securities, currencies and other assets denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of such
currencies against the U.S. dollar as provided by a pricing service. All assets
denominated in foreign currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rates in effect at the time of valuation.






DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS



The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction
with the section in the Prospectus entitled "Dividends, Distributions and
Taxes."


General Policies. Dividends from net investment income of a Fund, if any,
are declared and paid quarterly. Distributions of net realized securities gains,
if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make
distributions on a more frequent basis. The Trust reserves the right to declare
special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary
or advisable to preserve the status of such Fund as a regulated investment
company or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed
income.


Dividends and other distributions of Fund shares are distributed, as
described below, on a pro rata basis to Beneficial Owners of such shares.
Dividend payments are made through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants to
Beneficial Owners then of record with proceeds received from the Funds.


Dividend Reinvestment Service. No reinvestment service is provided by the
Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend
Reinvestment Service for use by Beneficial Owners of the Funds for reinvestment
of their dividend distributions. Beneficial Owners should contact their brokers
in order to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details
of participation therein. Brokers may require Beneficial Owners to adhere to
specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used,
dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically
reinvested in additional whole shares of each Fund purchased in the secondary
market.

EXHIBIT A - FTA PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES




FIRST TRUST ADVISORS L.P.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES



First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Adviser") serves as investment adviser
providing discretionary investment advisory services for separate managed
accounts, ERISA accounts and open- and closed-end investment companies (the
"Clients"). As part of these services, the Adviser may have responsibility for
proxy voting and related duties. In fulfilling these duties, the Adviser has
adopted the following policies and procedures:


1. It is the Adviser's policy to seek and to ensure that proxies are voted
on securities in a Client's account consistently and solely in the best economic
interests of the Client.


2. The Adviser shall be responsible for the oversight of Client proxy
voting processes and shall assign a senior member of its staff to be responsible
for this oversight.


3. The Adviser has engaged the services of Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. ("ISS") to make recommendations to the Adviser on the voting of
proxies related to securities held by Clients. ISS provides voting
recommendations based on established guidelines and practices. The Adviser has
adopted these ISS Proxy Voting Guidelines.


4. The Adviser shall review the ISS recommendations and generally will
vote proxies in accordance with such recommendations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Adviser may not vote in accordance with the ISS recommendations
if the Adviser believes that the specific ISS recommendation is not in the best
interests of the Client. In addition, whenever a conflict of interest arises
between ISS and a company subject to a proxy vote, the Adviser will vote the
proxy without using the analyses of ISS and will consider the recommendation of
the company and what the Adviser believes to be in the best interests of the
Client. In addition, if the Adviser has actual knowledge of any other type of
material conflict of interest between itself and the respective Client with
respect to the voting of a proxy, the Adviser shall vote the applicable proxy in
accordance with the ISS recommendations to avoid such conflict of interest. With
respect to open- and closed-end funds and variable annuity sub-accounts, if
there is a conflict of interest between fund shareholders and FTA, the fund's
principal underwriter, or sub-adviser, if applicable, FTA will vote the proxy
based on the recommendations of ISS to avoid such conflict of interest.


5. If the Adviser manages the assets or pension fund of a company and any
of the Adviser's Clients hold any securities in that company, the Adviser will
vote proxies relating to such company's securities in accordance with the ISS
recommendations to avoid any conflict of interest.


6. If a Client requests the Adviser to follow specific voting guidelines
or additional guidelines, the Adviser shall review the request and follow such


A-1





guidelines, unless the Adviser determines that it is unable to follow such
guidelines. In such case, the Adviser shall inform the Client that it is not
able to follow the Client's request.


7. FTA will monitor changes to the ISS guidelines to determine that such
guidelines continue to result in a voting policy that is in the best interests
of Clients.


8. In certain circumstances, where FTA has determined that it is
consistent with the Client's best interest, FTA will not take steps to ensure
that proxies are voted on securities in the Client's accounts. The following are
circumstances where this may occur:


(a) Limited Value. Proxies will not be required to be voted on
securities in a Client's account if the value of the Client's economic
interest in the securities is indeterminable or insignificant (less than
$1,000). Proxies will also not be required to be voted for any securities
that are no longer held by the Client's account.


(b) Securities Lending Program. When securities are out on loan,
they are transferred into the borrower's name and are voted by the
borrower, in its discretion. In most cases, FTA will not take steps to see
that loaned securities are voted. However, where FTA determines that a
proxy vote, or other shareholder action, is materially important to the
Client's account, FTA will make a good faith effort to recall the security
for purposes of voting, understanding that in certain cases, the attempt
to recall the security may not be effective in time for voting deadlines
to be met.


(c) Unjustifiable Costs. In certain circumstances, after doing a
cost-benefit analysis, FTA may choose not to vote where the cost of voting
a Client's proxy would exceed any anticipated benefits to the Client of
the proxy proposal (e.g. foreign securities).


9. For certain open- or closed-end funds relying on Section 12(d)(1)(F) of
the 1940 Act, FTA will vote on proxies of securities of investment companies
held by such funds in the same proportion as all other holders of such
securities (i.e. mirror or echo voting) to the extent possible.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS:




VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Generally vote for director nominees, except under the
following circumstances:


1. ACCOUNTABILITY


Vote against(1) or withhold from the entire board of directors (except new
nominees(2), who should be considered case-by-case) for the following:



PROBLEMATIC TAKEOVER DEFENSES




CLASSIFIED BOARD STRUCTURE:



1.1.  The board is classified, and a continuing director responsible for a
problematic governance issue at the board/committee level that would
warrant a withhold/against vote recommendation is not up for
election. All appropriate nominees (except new) may be held
accountable.






DIRECTOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION:



1.2.  The board lacks accountability and oversight, coupled with sustained
poor performance relative to peers. Sustained poor performance is
measured by one- and three-year total shareholder returns in the
bottom half of a company's four-digit GICS industry group (Russell
3000 companies only). Take into consideration the company's
five-year total shareholder return and operational metrics.
Problematic provisions include but are not limited to:


o     A classified board structure;


o     A supermajority vote requirement;


o     Either a plurality vote standard in uncontested director
elections or a majority vote standard with no plurality
carve-out for contested elections;


o     The inability of shareholders to call special meetings;


o     The inability of shareholders to act by written consent;


o     A dual-class capital structure; and/or


o     A non-shareholder-approved poison pill.




1     In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use "Withhold" as the
contrary vote option in director elections; companies with a majority vote
standard use "Against". However, it will vary by company and the proxy
must be checked to determine the valid contrary vote option for the
particular company.


2     A "new nominee" is any current nominee who has not already been elected by
shareholders and who joined the board after the problematic action in
question transpired. If ISS cannot determine whether the nominee joined
the board before or after the problematic action transpired, the nominee
will be considered a "new nominee" if he or she joined the board within
the 12 months prior to the upcoming shareholder meeting.

POISON PILLS:



1.3.  The company's poison pill has a "dead-hand" or "modified dead-hand"
feature. Vote against or withhold from nominees every year until
this feature is removed;


1.4.  The board adopts a poison pill with a term of more than 12 months
("long-term pill"), or renews any existing pill, including any
"short-term" pill (12 months or less), without shareholder approval.
A commitment or policy that puts a newly adopted pill to a binding
shareholder vote may potentially offset an adverse vote
recommendation. Review such companies with classified boards every
year, and such companies with annually elected boards at least once
every three years, and vote against or withhold votes from all
nominees if the company still maintains a non-shareholder-approved
poison pill; or


1.5.  The board makes a material adverse change to an existing poison pill
without shareholder approval.


Vote case-by-case on all nominees if:


1.6.  The board adopts a poison pill with a term of 12 months or less
("short-term pill") without shareholder approval, taking into
account the following factors:


o     The date of the pill's adoption relative to the date of the
next meeting of shareholders--i.e. whether the company had
time to put the pill on the ballot for shareholder
ratification given the circumstances;


o     The issuer's rationale;


o     The issuer's governance structure and practices; and


o     The issuer's track record of accountability to shareholders.



PROBLEMATIC AUDIT-RELATED PRACTICES



Generally vote against or withhold from the members of the Audit Committee if:


1.7.  The non-audit fees paid to the auditor are excessive (see discussion
under "Auditor Ratification");


1.8.  The company receives an adverse opinion on the company's financial
statements from its auditor; or


1.9.  There is persuasive evidence that the Audit Committee entered into
an inappropriate indemnification agreement with its auditor that
limits the ability of the company, or its shareholders, to pursue
legitimate legal recourse against the audit firm.


Vote case-by-case on members of the Audit Committee and potentially the full
board if:


1.10. Poor accounting practices are identified that rise to a level of
serious concern, such as: fraud; misapplication of GAAP; and
material weaknesses identified in Section 404 disclosures. Examine
the severity, breadth, chronological sequence, and duration, as well
as the company's efforts at remediation or corrective actions, in
determining whether withhold/against votes are warranted.






PROBLEMATIC COMPENSATION PRACTICES/PAY FOR PERFORMANCE MISALIGNMENT



In the absence of an Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation ballot item or in
egregious situations, vote against or withhold from the members of the
Compensation Committee and potentially the full board if:


1.11. There is a significant misalignment between CEO pay and company
performance (pay for performance);


1.12. The company maintains significant problematic pay practices;


1.13. The board exhibits a significant level of poor communication and
responsiveness to shareholders;


1.14. The company fails to submit one-time transfers of stock options to a
shareholder vote; or


1.15. The company fails to fulfill the terms of a burn rate commitment
made to shareholders.

ISS                                    2016 U.S. Concise Proxy Voting Guidelines




Vote case-by-case on Compensation Committee members (or, in exceptional cases,
the full board) and the Management Say-on-Pay proposal if:


1.16. The company's previous say-on-pay received the support of less than
70 percent of votes cast, taking into account:


o     The company's response, including:


o     Disclosure of engagement efforts with major
institutional investors regarding the issues that
contributed to the low level of support;


o     Specific actions taken to address the issues that
contributed to the low level of support;


o     Other recent compensation actions taken by the company;


o     Whether the issues raised are recurring or isolated;


o     The company's ownership structure; and


o     Whether the support level was less than 50 percent, which
would warrant the highest degree of responsiveness.



UNILATERAL BYLAW/CHARTER AMENDMENTS



1.17. Generally vote against or withhold from directors individually,
committee members, or the entire board (except new nominees, who
should be considered case-by-case) if the board amends the company's
bylaws or charter without shareholder approval in a manner that
materially diminishes shareholders' rights or that could adversely
impact shareholders, considering the following factors:


o     The board's rationale for adopting the bylaw/charter amendment
without shareholder ratification;


o     Disclosure by the company of any significant engagement with
shareholders regarding the amendment;


o     The level of impairment of shareholders' rights caused by the
board's unilateral amendment to the bylaws/charter;


o     The board's track record with regard to unilateral board
action on bylaw/charter amendments or other entrenchment
provisions;


o     The company's ownership structure;


o     The company's existing governance provisions;


o     The timing of the board's amendment to the bylaws/charter in
connection with a significant business development; and,


o     Other factors, as deemed appropriate, that may be relevant to
determine the impact of the amendment on shareholders.


Unless the adverse amendment is reversed or submitted to a binding shareholder
vote, in subsequent years vote case-by-case on director nominees. Generally vote
against (except new nominees, who should be considered case-by-case) if the
directors:


o     Classified the board;


o     Adopted supermajority vote requirements to amend the bylaws or
charter; or


o     Eliminated shareholders' ability to amend bylaws.


1.18. For newly public companies, generally vote against or withhold from
directors individually, committee members, or the entire board
(except new nominees, who should be considered case-by-case) if,
prior to or in connection with the company's public offering, the
company or its board adopted bylaw or charter provisions materially
adverse to shareholder rights, considering the following factors:


o     The level of impairment of shareholders' rights caused by the
provision;


o     The disclosed rationale for adopting the provision;


o     The ability to change the governance structure in the future
(e.g., limitations on shareholders' right to amend the bylaws
or charter, or supermajority vote requirements to amend the
bylaws or charter);

            o     The ability of shareholders to hold directors accountable
                  through annual director elections, or whether the company has
                  a classified board structure; and,

            o     A public commitment to put the provision to a shareholder vote
                  within three years of the date of the initial public offering.








Unless the adverse provision is reversed or submitted to a vote of public
shareholders, vote case-by-case on director nominees in subsequent years.



GOVERNANCE FAILURES



Under extraordinary circumstances, vote against or withhold from directors
individually, committee members, or the entire board, due to:


1.19. Material failures of governance, stewardship, risk oversight (3), or
fiduciary responsibilities at the company;


1.20. Failure to replace management as appropriate; or


1.21. Egregious actions related to a director's service on other boards
that raise substantial doubt about his or her ability to effectively
oversee management and serve the best interests of shareholders at
any company.


2. RESPONSIVENESS


Vote case-by-case on individual directors, committee members, or the entire
board of directors as appropriate if:


2.1.  The board failed to act on a shareholder proposal that received the
support of a majority of the shares cast in the previous year.
Factors that will be considered are:


o     Disclosed outreach efforts by the board to shareholders in the
wake of the vote;


o     Rationale provided in the proxy statement for the level of
implementation;


o     The subject matter of the proposal;


o     The level of support for and opposition to the resolution in
past meetings;


o     Actions taken by the board in response to the majority vote
and its engagement with shareholders;


o     The continuation of the underlying issue as a voting item on
the ballot (as either shareholder or management proposals);
and


o     Other factors as appropriate.


2.2.  The board failed to act on takeover offers where the majority of
shares are tendered;


2.3.  At the previous board election, any director received more than 50
percent withhold/against votes of the shares cast and the company
has failed to address the issue(s) that caused the high
withhold/against vote;


2.4.  The board implements an advisory vote on executive compensation on a
less frequent basis than the frequency that received the majority of
votes cast at the most recent shareholder meeting at which
shareholders voted on the say-on-pay frequency; or


2.5.  The board implements an advisory vote on executive compensation on a
less frequent basis than the frequency that received a plurality,
but not a majority, of the votes cast at the most recent shareholder
meeting at which shareholders voted on the say-on-pay frequency,
taking into account:


o     The board's rationale for selecting a frequency that is
different from the frequency that received a plurality;


o     The company's ownership structure and vote results;




3     Examples of failure of risk oversight include, but are not limited to:

bribery; large or serial fines or sanctions from regulatory bodies;
significant adverse legal judgments or settlements; hedging of company
stock; or significant pledging of company stock.

            o     The previous year's support level on the company's say-on-pay
                  proposal.








3. COMPOSITION



ATTENDANCE AT BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS:



3.1.  Generally vote against or withhold from directors (except new
nominees, who should be considered case-by-case(4)) who attend less
than 75 percent of the aggregate of their board and committee
meetings for the period for which they served, unless an acceptable
reason for absences is disclosed in the proxy or another SEC filing.
Acceptable reasons for director absences are generally limited to
the following:


o     Medical issues/illness;


o     Family emergencies; and


o     Missing only one meeting (when the total of all meetings is
three or fewer).


3.2.  If the proxy disclosure is unclear and insufficient to determine
whether a director attended at least 75 percent of the aggregate of
his/her board and committee meetings during his/her period of
service, vote against or withhold from the director(s) in question.



OVERBOARDED DIRECTORS:



Vote against or withhold from individual directors who:


3.3.  Sit on more than six public company boards; with respect to annual
meetings on or after Feb. 1, 2017(5), sit on more than five
public company boards; or


3.4.  Are CEOs of public companies who sit on the boards of more than two
public companies besides their own--withhold only at their outside
boards(6).


4. INDEPENDENCE


Vote against or withhold from Inside Directors and Affiliated Outside Directors
(per the Categorization of Directors) when:


4.1.  The inside or affiliated outside director serves on any of the three
key committees: audit, compensation, or nominating;


4.2.  The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so
that the full board functions as that committee;


4.3.  The company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if the board
attests that the independent directors fulfill the functions of such
a committee; or


4.4.  Independent directors make up less than a majority of the directors.




4     For new nominees only, schedule conflicts due to commitments made prior to
their appointment to the board are considered if disclosed in the proxy or
another SEC filing.


5     This policy change includes a 1-year transition period to allow time for
affected directors to address necessary changes if they wish.


6     Although all of a CEO's subsidiary boards will be counted as separate
boards, ISS will not recommend a withhold vote from the CEO of a parent
company board or any of the controlled (>50 percent ownership)
subsidiaries of that parent, but may do so at subsidiaries that are less
than 50 percent controlled and boards outside the parent/subsidiary
relationships.

INDEPENDENT CHAIR (SEPARATE CHAIR/CEO)



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Generally vote for shareholder proposals requiring that
the chairman's position be filled by an independent director, taking into
consideration the following:


o     The scope of the proposal;


o     The company's current board leadership structure;


o     The company's governance structure and practices;


o     Company performance; and


o     Any other relevant factors that may be applicable.


Regarding the scope of the proposal, consider whether the proposal is precatory
or binding and whether the proposal is seeking an immediate change in the
chairman role or the policy can be implemented at the next CEO transition.


Under the review of the company's board leadership structure, ISS may support
the proposal under the following scenarios absent a compelling rationale: the
presence of an executive or non-independent chair in addition to the CEO; a
recent recombination of the role of CEO and chair; and/or departure from a
structure with an independent chair. ISS will also consider any recent
transitions in board leadership and the effect such transitions may have on
independent board leadership as well as the designation of a lead director role.


When considering the governance structure, ISS will consider the overall
independence of the board, the independence of key committees, the establishment
of governance guidelines, board tenure and its relationship to CEO tenure, and
any other factors that may be relevant. Any concerns about a company's
governance structure will weigh in favor of support for the proposal.


The review of the company's governance practices may include, but is not limited
to poor compensation practices, material failures of governance and risk
oversight, related-party transactions or other issues putting director
independence at risk, corporate or management scandals, and actions by
management or the board with potential or realized negative impact on
shareholders. Any such practices may suggest a need for more independent
oversight at the company thus warranting support of the proposal.


ISS' performance assessment will generally consider one-, three, and five-year
TSR compared to the company's peers and the market as a whole. While poor
performance will weigh in favor of the adoption of an independent chair policy,
strong performance over the long-term will be considered a mitigating factor
when determining whether the proposed leadership change warrants support.



PROXY ACCESS



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Generally vote for management and shareholder proposals
for proxy access with the following provisions:


o     OWNERSHIP THRESHOLD: maximum requirement not more than three percent (3%)
of the voting power;


o     OWNERSHIP DURATION: maximum requirement not longer than three (3) years of
continuous ownership for each member of the nominating group;


o     AGGREGATION: minimal or no limits on the number of shareholders permitted
to form a nominating group;


o     CAP: cap on nominees of generally twenty-five percent (25%) of the board.


Review for reasonableness any other restrictions on the right of proxy access.


Generally vote against proposals that are more restrictive than these
guidelines.

PROXY CONTESTS/PROXY ACCESS -- VOTING FOR DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN
CONTESTED ELECTIONS



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Vote case-by-case on the election of directors in
contested elections, considering the following factors:


o     Long-term financial performance of the company relative to its industry;


o     Management's track record;


o     Background to the contested election;


o     Nominee qualifications and any compensatory arrangements;


o     Strategic plan of dissident slate and quality of the critique against
management;


o     Likelihood that the proposed goals and objectives can be achieved (both
slates); and


o     Stock ownership positions.


In the case of candidates nominated pursuant to proxy access, vote case-by-case
considering any applicable factors listed above or additional factors which may
be relevant, including those that are specific to the company, to the nominee(s)
and/or to the nature of the election (such as whether or not there are more
candidates than board seats).



CAPITAL/RESTRUCTURING




COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZATION



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Vote for proposals to increase the number of authorized
common shares where the primary purpose of the increase is to issue shares in
connection with a transaction on the same ballot that warrants support.


Vote against proposals at companies with more than one class of common stock to
increase the number of authorized shares of the class of common stock that has
superior voting rights.


Vote against proposals to increase the number of authorized common shares if a
vote for a reverse stock split on the same ballot is warranted despite the fact
that the authorized shares would not be reduced proportionally.


Vote case-by-case on all other proposals to increase the number of shares of
common stock authorized for issuance. Take into account company-specific factors
that include, at a minimum, the following:


o     Past Board Performance:


o     The company's use of authorized shares during the last three
years


o     The Current Request:


o     Disclosure in the proxy statement of the specific purposes of
the proposed increase;


o     Disclosure in the proxy statement of specific and severe risks
to shareholders of not approving the request; and


o     The dilutive impact of the request as determined relative to
an allowable increase calculated by ISS (typically 100 percent
of existing authorized shares) that reflects the company's
need for shares and total shareholder returns.


ISS will apply the relevant allowable increase below to requests to increase
common stock that are for general corporate purposes (or to the general
corporate purposes portion of a request that also includes a specific need):


A.    Most companies: 100 PERCENT of existing authorized shares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


B.    Companies with less than 50 percent of existing authorized shares either
      outstanding or reserved for issuance: 50 PERCENT of existing authorized
      shares.

C.    Companies with one- and three-year total shareholder returns (TSRs) in the
      bottom 10 percent of the U.S. market as of the end of the calendar quarter
      that is closest to their most recent fiscal year end: 50 PERCENT of
      existing authorized shares.

D.    Companies at which both conditions (B and C) above are both present: 25
      PERCENT of existing authorized shares.








If there is an acquisition, private placement, or similar transaction on the
ballot (not including equity incentive plans) that ISS is recommending FOR, the
allowable increase will be the greater of (i) twice the amount needed to support
the transactions on the ballot, and (ii) the allowable increase as calculated
above.



MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Vote case-by-case on mergers and acquisitions. Review
and evaluate the merits and drawbacks of the proposed transaction, balancing
various and sometimes countervailing factors including:


o     Valuation - Is the value to be received by the target shareholders (or
paid by the acquirer) reasonable? While the fairness opinion may provide
an initial starting point for assessing valuation reasonableness, emphasis
is placed on the offer premium, market reaction and strategic rationale.


o     Market reaction - How has the market responded to the proposed deal? A
negative market reaction should cause closer scrutiny of a deal.


o     Strategic rationale - Does the deal make sense strategically? From where
is the value derived? Cost and revenue synergies should not be overly
aggressive or optimistic, but reasonably achievable. Management should
also have a favorable track record of successful integration of historical
acquisitions.


o     Negotiations and process - Were the terms of the transaction negotiated at
arm's-length? Was the process fair and equitable? A fair process helps to
ensure the best price for shareholders. Significant negotiation "wins" can
also signify the deal makers' competency. The comprehensiveness of the
sales process (e.g., full auction, partial auction, no auction) can also
affect shareholder value.


o     Conflicts of interest - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction
disproportionately and inappropriately as compared to non-insider
shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the directors and
officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger
than if they did not hold these interests. Consider whether these
interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support or
recommend the merger. The CIC figure presented in the "ISS Transaction
Summary" section of this report is an aggregate figure that can in certain
cases be a misleading indicator of the true value transfer from
shareholders to insiders. Where such figure appears to be excessive,
analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether a potential
conflict exists.


o     Governance - Will the combined company have a better or worse governance
profile than the current governance profiles of the respective parties to
the transaction? If the governance profile is to change for the worse, the
burden is on the company to prove that other issues (such as valuation)
outweigh any deterioration in governance.



COMPENSATION




Executive Pay Evaluation



Underlying all evaluations are five global principles that most investors expect
corporations to adhere to in designing and administering executive and director
compensation programs:


1.    Maintain appropriate pay-for-performance alignment, with emphasis on
long-term shareholder value: This principle encompasses overall
executive pay practices, which must be designed to attract, retain,
and appropriately motivate the key employees who drive shareholder
value creation over the long term. It will take into consideration,
among other factors, the link between pay and performance; the mix
between fixed and variable pay; performance goals; and equity-based
plan costs;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.    Avoid arrangements that risk "pay for failure": This principle
            addresses the appropriateness of long or indefinite contracts,
            excessive severance packages, and guaranteed compensation;

      3.    Maintain an independent and effective compensation committee: This
            principle promotes oversight of executive pay programs by directors
            with appropriate skills, knowledge, experience, and a sound process
            for compensation decision-making (e.g., including access to
            independent expertise and advice when needed);

      4.    Provide shareholders with clear, comprehensive compensation
            disclosures: This principle underscores the importance of
            informative and timely disclosures that enable shareholders to
            evaluate executive pay practices fully and fairly;

      5.    Avoid inappropriate pay to non-executive directors: This principle
            recognizes the interests of shareholders in ensuring that
            compensation to outside directors does not compromise their
            independence and ability to make appropriate judgments in overseeing
            managers' pay and performance. At the market level, it may
            incorporate a variety of generally accepted best practices.









ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION--MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS (MANAGEMENT
SAY-ON-PAY)



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Vote case-by-case on ballot items related to executive
pay and practices, as well as certain aspects of outside director compensation.


Vote against Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation (Management
Say-on-Pay--MSOP) if:


o     There is a significant misalignment between CEO pay and company
performance (pay for performance);


o     The company maintains significant problematic pay practices;


o     The board exhibits a significant level of poor communication and
responsiveness to shareholders.


Vote against or withhold from the members of the Compensation Committee and
potentially the full board if:


o     There is no MSOP on the ballot, and an against vote on an MSOP is
warranted due to pay for performance misalignment, problematic pay
practices, or the lack of adequate responsiveness on compensation issues
raised previously, or a combination thereof;


o     The board fails to respond adequately to a previous MSOP proposal that
received less than 70 percent support of votes cast;


o     The company has recently practiced or approved problematic pay practices,
including option repricing or option backdating; or


o     The situation is egregious.



PRIMARY EVALUATION FACTORS FOR EXECUTIVE PAY







PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE EVALUATION



ISS annually conducts a pay-for-performance analysis to identify strong or
satisfactory alignment between pay and performance over a sustained period. With
respect to companies in the Russell 3000 or Russell 3000E Indices(7), this
analysis considers the following:


1.    Peer Group(8) Alignment:




7     The Russell 3000E Index includes approximately 4,000 of the largest U.S.
equity securities.

ISS                                    2016 U.S. Concise Proxy Voting Guidelines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


      o     The degree of alignment between the company's annualized TSR rank
            and the CEO's annualized total pay rank within a peer group, each
            measured over a three-year period.

      o     The multiple of the CEO's total pay relative to the peer group
            median.


      2.    Absolute Alignment(9) - the absolute alignment between
            the trend in CEO pay and company TSR over the prior five fiscal
            years - i.e., the difference between the trend in annual pay changes
            and the trend in annualized TSR during the period.








If the above analysis demonstrates significant unsatisfactory long-term
pay-for-performance alignment or, in the case of companies outside the Russell
indices, misaligned pay and performance are otherwise suggested, our analysis
may include any of the following qualitative factors, as relevant to evaluating
how various pay elements may work to encourage or to undermine long-term value
creation and alignment with shareholder interests:


o     The ratio of performance- to time-based equity awards;


o     The overall ratio of performance-based compensation;


o     The completeness of disclosure and rigor of performance goals;


o     The company's peer group benchmarking practices;


o     Actual results of financial/operational metrics, such as growth in
revenue, profit, cash flow, etc., both absolute and relative to peers;


o     Special circumstances related to, for example, a new CEO in the prior FY
or anomalous equity grant practices (e.g., bi-annual awards);


o     Realizable pay(10) compared to grant pay; and


o     Any other factors deemed relevant.



PROBLEMATIC PAY PRACTICES



The focus is on executive compensation practices that contravene the global pay
principles, including:


o     Problematic practices related to non-performance-based compensation
elements;


o     Incentives that may motivate excessive risk-taking; and


o     Options Backdating.






PROBLEMATIC PAY PRACTICES RELATED TO NON-PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION ELEMENTS



Pay elements that are not directly based on performance are generally evaluated
case-by-case considering the context of a company's overall pay program and
demonstrated pay-for-performance philosophy. Please refer to ISS' Compensation
FAQ document for detail on specific pay practices that have been identified as
potentially problematic and may lead to negative recommendations if they are
deemed to be inappropriate or unjustified relative to executive pay best
practices. The list below highlights the problematic practices that carry
significant weight in this overall consideration and may result in adverse vote
recommendations:




8     The revised peer group is generally comprised of 14-24 companies that are
selected using market cap, revenue (or assets for certain financial
firms), GICS industry group, and company's selected peers' GICS industry
group, with size constraints, via a process designed to select peers that
are comparable to the subject company in terms of revenue/assets and
industry, and also within a market cap bucket that is reflective of the
company's. For Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels companies, market cap is the
only size determinant.


9     Only Russell 3000 Index companies are subject to the Absolute Alignment
analysis.

o     Repricing or replacing of underwater stock options/SARS without prior
      shareholder approval (including cash buyouts and voluntary surrender of
      underwater options);

o     Excessive perquisites or tax gross-ups, including any gross-up related to
      a secular trust or restricted stock vesting;

o     New or extended agreements that provide for:

      o     CIC payments exceeding 3 times base salary and average/target/most
            recent bonus;

      o     CIC severance payments without involuntary job loss or substantial
            diminution of duties ("single" or "modified single" triggers);

      o     CIC payments with excise tax gross-ups (including "modified"
            gross-ups);

o     Insufficient executive compensation disclosure by externally- managed
      issuers (EMIs) such that a reasonable assessment of pay programs and
      practices applicable to the EMI's executives is not possible.









INCENTIVES THAT MAY MOTIVATE EXCESSIVE RISK-TAKING



o     Multi-year guaranteed bonuses;


o     A single or common performance metric used for short- and long-term plans;


o     Lucrative severance packages;


o     High pay opportunities relative to industry peers;


o     Disproportionate supplemental pensions; or


o     Mega annual equity grants that provide unlimited upside with no downside
risk.


Factors that potentially mitigate the impact of risky incentives include
rigorous claw-back provisions and robust stock ownership/holding guidelines.



OPTIONS BACKDATING



The following factors should be examined case-by-case to allow for distinctions
to be made between "sloppy" plan administration versus deliberate action or
fraud:


o     Reason and motive for the options backdating issue, such as inadvertent
vs. deliberate grant date changes;


o     Duration of options backdating;


o     Size of restatement due to options backdating;


o     Corrective actions taken by the board or compensation committee, such as
canceling or re-pricing backdated options, the recouping of option gains
on backdated grants; and


o     Adoption of a grant policy that prohibits backdating, and creates a fixed
grant schedule or window period for equity grants in the future.



COMPENSATION COMMITTEE COMMUNICATIONS AND RESPONSIVENESS



Consider the following factors case-by-case when evaluating ballot items related
to executive pay on the board's responsiveness to investor input and engagement
on compensation issues:


o     Failure to respond to majority-supported shareholder proposals on
executive pay topics; or


o     Failure to adequately respond to the company's previous say-on-pay
proposal that received the support of less than 70 percent of votes
cast, taking into account:


o     The company's response, including:


o     Disclosure of engagement efforts with major
institutional investors regarding the issues that
contributed to the low level of support;


o     Specific actions taken to address the issues that
contributed to the low level of support;


o     Other recent compensation actions taken by the company;

            o     Whether the issues raised are recurring or isolated;

            o     The company's ownership structure; and

            o     Whether the support level was less than 50 percent, which
                  would warrant the highest degree of responsiveness.









Equity-Based and Other Incentive Plans



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Vote case-by-case on certain equity-based compensation
plans(11) depending on a combination of certain plan features and equity
grant practices, where positive factors may counterbalance negative factors, and
vice versa, as evaluated using an "equity plan scorecard" (EPSC) approach with
three pillars:


o     PLAN COST: The total estimated cost of the company's equity plans relative
to industry/market cap peers, measured by the company's estimated
Shareholder Value Transfer (SVT) in relation to peers and considering
both:


o     SVT based on new shares requested plus shares remaining for future
grants, plus outstanding unvested/unexercised grants; and


o     SVT based only on new shares requested plus shares remaining for
future grants.


o     PLAN FEATURES:


o     Automatic single-triggered award vesting upon a change in control
(CIC);


o     Discretionary vesting authority;


o     Liberal share recycling on various award types;


o     Lack of minimum vesting period for grants made under the plan.


o     GRANT PRACTICES:


o     The company's three year burn rate relative to its industry/market
cap peers;


o     Vesting requirements in most recent CEO equity grants (3-year
look-back);


o     The estimated duration of the plan (based on the sum of shares
remaining available and the new shares requested, divided by the
average annual shares granted in the prior three years);


o     The proportion of the CEO's most recent equity grants/awards subject
to performance conditions;


o     Whether the company maintains a claw-back policy;


o     Whether the company has established post exercise/vesting
share-holding requirements.


Generally vote against the plan proposal if the combination of above factors
indicates that the plan is not, overall, in shareholders' interests, or if any
of the following egregious factors apply:


o     Awards may vest in connection with a liberal change-of-control definition;


o     The plan would permit repricing or cash buyout of underwater options
without shareholder approval (either by expressly permitting it - for NYSE
and Nasdaq listed companies -- or by not prohibiting it when the company
has a history of repricing - for non-listed companies);


o     The plan is a vehicle for problematic pay practices or a significant
pay-for-performance disconnect under certain circumstances; or


o     Any other plan features are determined to have a significant negative
impact on shareholder interests.




11    Proposals evaluated under the EPSC policy generally include those to
approve or amend (1) stock option plans for employees and/or employees and
directors, (2) restricted stock plans for employees and/or employees and
directors, and (3) omnibus stock incentive plans for employees and/or
employees and directors.

SOCIAL/ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES (SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS)




Global Approach



Issues covered under the policy include a wide range of topics, including
consumer and product safety, environment and energy, labor standards and human
rights, workplace and board diversity, and corporate political issues. While a
variety of factors goes into each analysis, the overall principle guiding all
vote recommendations focuses on how the proposal may enhance or protect
shareholder value in either the short or long term.


GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Generally vote case-by-case, taking into consideration
whether implementation of the proposal is likely to enhance or protect
shareholder value, and in addition the following will also be considered:


o     If the issues presented in the proposal are more appropriately or
effectively dealt with through legislation or government regulation;


o     If the company has already responded in an appropriate and sufficient
manner to the issue(s) raised in the proposal;


o     Whether the proposal's request is unduly burdensome (scope or timeframe)
or overly prescriptive;


o     The company's approach compared with any industry standard practices for
addressing the issue(s) raised by the proposal;


o     If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency,
whether or not reasonable and sufficient information is currently
available to shareholders from the company or from other publicly
available sources; and


o     If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency,
whether or not implementation would reveal proprietary or confidential
information that could place the company at a competitive disadvantage.



CLIMATE CHANGE/GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Generally vote for resolutions requesting that a company
disclose information on the risks related to climate change on its operations
and investments, such as financial, physical, or regulatory risks, considering:


o     Whether the company already provides current, publicly-available
information on the impact that climate change may have on the company as
well as associated company policies and procedures to address related
risks and/or opportunities;


o     The company's level of disclosure is at least comparable to that of
industry peers; and


o     There are no significant controversies, fines, penalties, or litigation
associated with the company's environmental performance.


Generally vote for proposals requesting a report on greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions from company operations and/or products and operations, unless:


o     The company already discloses current, publicly-available information on
the impacts that GHG emissions may have on the company as well as
associated company policies and procedures to address related risks and/or
opportunities;


o     The company's level of disclosure is comparable to that of industry peers;
and


o     There are no significant, controversies, fines, penalties, or litigation
associated with the company's GHG emissions.


Vote case-by-case on proposals that call for the adoption of GHG reduction goals
from products and operations, taking into account:


o     Whether the company provides disclosure of year-over-year GHG emissions
performance data;


o     Whether company disclosure lags behind industry peers;

o     The company's actual GHG emissions performance;

o     The company's current GHG emission policies, oversight mechanisms, and
      related initiatives; and

o     Whether the company has been the subject of recent, significant
      violations, fines, litigation, or controversy related to GHG emissions.









BOARD DIVERSITY



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Generally vote for requests for reports on a company's
efforts to diversify the board, unless:


o     The gender and racial minority representation of the company's board is
reasonably inclusive in relation to companies of similar size and
business; and


o     The board already reports on its nominating procedures and gender and
racial minority initiatives on the board and within the company.


Vote case-by-case on proposals asking a company to increase the gender and
racial minority representation on its board, taking into account:


o     The degree of existing gender and racial minority diversity on the
company's board and among its executive officers;


o     The level of gender and racial minority representation that exists at the
company's industry peers;


o     The company's established process for addressing gender and racial
minority board representation;


o     Whether the proposal includes an overly prescriptive request to amend
nominating committee charter language;


o     The independence of the company's nominating committee;


o     Whether the company uses an outside search firm to identify potential
director nominees; and


o     Whether the company has had recent controversies, fines, or litigation
regarding equal employment practices.



SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Generally vote for proposals requesting that a company
report on its policies, initiatives, and oversight mechanisms related to social,
economic, and environmental sustainability, unless:


o     The company already discloses similar information through existing reports
or policies such as an environment, health, and safety (EHS) report; a
comprehensive code of corporate conduct; and/or a diversity report; or


o     The company has formally committed to the implementation of a reporting
program based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines or a similar
standard within a specified time frame.



ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) COMPENSATION-RELATED PROPOSALS



GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: Vote case-by-case on proposals to link, or report on
linking, executive compensation to sustainability (environmental and social)
criteria, considering:


o     Whether the company has significant and/or persistent controversies or
regulatory violations regarding social and/or environmental issues;


o     Whether the company has management systems and oversight mechanisms in
place regarding its social and environmental performance;


o     The degree to which industry peers have incorporated similar non-financial
performance criteria in their executive compensation practices; and


o     The company's current level of disclosure regarding its environmental and
social performance.

Section 9.5. Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. Subject to the
exceptions and limitations contained in this Section 9.5, every person who is,
or has been, a Trustee, officer, or employee of the Trust, including persons who
serve at the request of the Trust as directors, trustees, officers, employees or
agents of another organization in which the Trust has an interest as a
shareholder, creditor or otherwise (hereinafter referred to as a "Covered
Person"), shall be indemnified by the Trust to the fullest extent permitted by
law against liability and against all expenses reasonably incurred or paid by
him or in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding in which he
becomes involved as a party or otherwise by virtue of his being or having been
such a Trustee, director, officer, employee or agent and against amounts paid or
incurred by him in settlement thereof.


No indemnification shall be provided hereunder to a Covered Person to the
extent such indemnification is prohibited by applicable federal law.


The rights of indemnification herein provided may be insured against by
policies maintained by the Trust, shall be severable, shall not affect any other
rights to which any Covered Person may now or hereafter be entitled, shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be such a Covered Person and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a
person.


Subject to applicable federal law, expenses of preparation and
presentation of a defense to any claim, action, suit or proceeding subject to a
claim for indemnification under this Section 9.5 shall be advanced by the Trust
prior to final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of the recipient to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that
he is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 9.5.


To the extent that any determination is required to be made as to whether
a Covered Person engaged in conduct for which indemnification is not provided as
described herein, or as to whether there is reason to believe that a Covered
Person ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification, the Person or
Persons making the determination shall afford the Covered Person a rebuttable
presumption that the Covered Person has not engaged in such conduct and that
there is reason to believe that the Covered Person ultimately will be found
entitled to indemnification.


As used in this Section 9.5, the words "claim," "action," "suit" or
"proceeding" shall apply to all claims, demands, actions, suits, investigations,
regulatory inquiries, proceedings or any other occurrence of a similar nature,
whether actual or threatened and whether civil, criminal, administrative or
other, including appeals, and the words "liability" and "expenses" shall include
without limitation, attorneys' fees, costs, judgments, amounts paid in
settlement, fines, penalties and other liabilities.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT



INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT made this fourth day of February 2016, by
and between FIRST TRUST EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND III, a Massachusetts business trust
(the "Trust"), and FIRST TRUST ADVISORS L.P., an Illinois limited partnership
(the "Adviser").


WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended ("1940 Act"), as an open-end management investment company;


WHEREAS, the Trust is authorized to issue shares in separate series, with
each such series representing interests in a separate portfolio of securities
and other assets;


WHEREAS, the Trust intends to offer shares in series as set forth on
Schedule A attached hereto and any other series as to which this Agreement may
hereafter be made applicable and set forth on Schedule A, which may be amended
from time to time (each such series being herein referred to as a "Fund," and
collectively as the "Funds"); and


WHEREAS, the Trust desires to retain the Adviser as investment adviser, to
furnish certain investment advisory and portfolio management services to the
Trust with respect to the Funds, and the Adviser is willing to furnish such
services.



WITNESSETH:



In consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter contained, it is
hereby agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows:


1. The Trust hereby engages the Adviser to act as the investment adviser
for, and to set the overall investment strategy and manage the investment and
reinvestment of the assets of, each Fund in accordance with each Fund's
investment objectives and policies and limitations, and to administer each
Fund's affairs to the extent requested by and subject to the supervision of the
Board of Trustees of the Trust for the period and upon the terms herein set
forth. The investment of each Fund's assets shall be subject to the Fund's
policies, restrictions and limitations with respect to investments as set forth
in the Fund's then current registration statement under the l940 Act, and all
applicable laws and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to the management of registered open-end management investment
companies.


The Adviser accepts such employment and agrees during such period to
render such services, to furnish office facilities and equipment and clerical,
bookkeeping and administrative services (other than such services, if any,
provided by the Funds' transfer agent, administrator or other service providers)
for the Funds, to permit any of its officers or employees to serve without
compensation as trustees or officers of the Trust if elected or appointed to
such positions, and to assume the obligations herein set forth for the
compensation herein provided. The Adviser shall at its own expense furnish all
executive and other personnel, office space, and office facilities required to
render the investment management and administrative services set forth in this





Agreement. In the event that the Adviser pays or assumes any expenses of a Fund
not required to be paid or assumed by the Adviser under this Agreement, the
Adviser shall not be obligated hereby to pay or assume the same or similar
expense in the future; provided, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to relieve the Adviser of any obligation to a Fund under any separate agreement
or arrangement between the parties.


2. The Adviser shall, for all purposes herein provided, be deemed to be
an independent contractor and, unless otherwise expressly provided or
authorized, shall neither have the authority to act for nor represent the Trust
in any way, nor otherwise be deemed an agent of the Trust.


3. For the services and facilities described in Section 1, each Fund will
pay to the Adviser, at the end of each calendar month, and the Adviser agrees to
accept as full compensation therefore, an investment management fee equal to the
annual rate of each Fund's average daily net assets as set forth on Schedule A.


For the month and year in which this Agreement becomes effective, or
terminates, there shall be an appropriate proration on the basis of the number
of days that the Agreement shall have been in effect during the month and year,
respectively. The services of the Adviser to the Trust under this Agreement are
not to be deemed exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to render similar
services or other services to others so long as its services hereunder are not
impaired thereby.


4. During the term of this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay all of the
expenses of each Fund of the Trust (including the cost of transfer agency,
sub-advisory, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services and
license fees, if any) but excluding the fee payment under this Agreement,
interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and other expenses connected with the
execution of portfolio transactions (such as dividend and distribution expenses
from securities sold short and/or other investment related costs), distribution
and service fees payable pursuant to a Rule 12b-1 plan, if any, and
extraordinary expenses.


5. The Adviser shall arrange for suitably qualified officers or employees
of the Adviser to serve, without compensation from the Trust, as Trustees,
officers or agents of the Trust, if duly elected or appointed to such positions,
and subject to their individual consent and to any limitations imposed by law.


6. For purposes of this Agreement, brokerage commissions paid by a Fund
upon the purchase or sale of a Fund's portfolio securities or other assets shall
be considered a cost of the securities or assets of the Fund and shall be paid
by the Fund.


7. The Adviser is authorized to select the brokers, dealers, futures
commission merchants, banks, or any other agent or counterparty that will
execute the purchases and sales of a Fund's portfolio investments on behalf of
the Fund, and is directed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
best execution, which includes most favorable net results and execution of the
Fund's orders, taking into account all appropriate factors, including price,
dealer spread or commission, size and difficulty of the transaction and research


-2-





or other services provided. Subject to approval by the Trust's Board of Trustees
and to the extent permitted by and in conformance with applicable law and the
rules and regulations thereunder (including Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act), the
Adviser may select brokers, dealers, futures commission merchants or other
persons affiliated with the Adviser. It is understood that the Adviser will not
be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary duty to the
Trust, or be in breach of any obligation owing to the Trust under this
Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to pay a
member of a securities exchange, a broker or a dealer a commission for effecting
a securities transaction for the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have charged if the
Adviser determined in good faith that the commission paid was reasonable in
relation to the brokerage or research services provided by such member, broker
or dealer, viewed in terms of that particular transaction or the Adviser's
overall responsibilities with respect to its accounts, including the Fund, as to
which it exercises investment discretion.


In addition, the Adviser may, to the extent permitted by applicable law
and the rules and regulations thereunder, aggregate purchase and sale orders of
portfolio investments with similar orders being made simultaneously for other
accounts managed by the Adviser or its affiliates, if in the Adviser's
reasonable judgment such aggregation shall result in an overall economic benefit
to a Fund, taking into consideration the selling or purchase price, brokerage
commissions and other expenses. In the event that a purchase or sale of an asset
of a Fund occurs as part of any aggregate sale or purchase orders, the objective
of the Adviser and any of its affiliates involved in such transaction shall be
to allocate the securities or other assets so purchased or sold, as well as
expenses incurred in the transaction, among the Fund and other accounts in an
equitable manner. Nevertheless, each Fund acknowledges that under some
circumstances, such allocation may adversely affect the Fund with respect to the
price or size of the portfolio investments obtainable or salable. Whenever a
Fund and one or more other investment advisory clients of the Adviser have
available funds for investment, investments suitable and appropriate for each
will be allocated in a manner believed by the Adviser to be equitable to each,
although such allocation may result in a delay in one or more client accounts
being fully invested that would not occur if such an allocation were not made.
Moreover, it is possible that due to differing investment objectives or for
other reasons, the Adviser and its affiliates may purchase securities or other
instruments of an issuer for one client and at approximately the same time
recommend selling or sell the same or similar types of securities, assets or
instruments for another client.


The Adviser will not arrange purchases or sales of portfolio investments
between a Fund and other accounts advised by the Adviser or its affiliates
unless (a) such purchases or sales are in accordance with applicable law and the
rules and regulations thereunder (including Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act) and
the Trust's policies and procedures, (b) the Adviser determines the purchase or
sale is in the best interests of each Fund, and (c) the Trust's Board of
Trustees has approved these types of transactions.


To the extent a Fund seeks to adopt, amend or eliminate any objectives,
policies, restrictions or procedures in a manner that modifies or restricts
Adviser's authority regarding the execution of the Fund's portfolio
transactions, the Fund agrees to use reasonable commercial efforts to consult
with the Adviser regarding the modifications or restrictions prior to such
adoption, amendment or elimination.


-3-





The Adviser will communicate to the officers and Trustees of the Trust
such information relating to transactions for the Funds as they may reasonably
request. In no instance will portfolio investments be purchased by or sold to
the Adviser or any affiliated person of either the Trust or the Adviser, except
as may be permitted under the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations thereunder or
any applicable exemptive orders.


The Adviser further agrees that it:


(a) will use the same degree of skill and care in providing such
services as it uses in providing services to fiduciary accounts for which
it has investment responsibilities;


(b) will (i) conform in all material respects to all applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, (ii) comply in all material respects
with all policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees for the
Trust and communicated to the Adviser, and (iii) conduct its activities
under this Agreement in all material respects in accordance with any
applicable regulations of any governmental authority pertaining to its
investment advisory, commodity pool operator and commodity trading
advisory activities;


(c) will report regularly to the Board of Trustees of the Trust
(generally on a quarterly basis) and will make appropriate persons
available for the purpose of reviewing with representatives of the Board
of Trustees on a regular basis at reasonable times the management of each
Fund, including, without limitation, review of the general investment
strategies of each Fund, the performance of each Fund's investment
portfolio in relation to relevant standard industry indices and general
conditions affecting the marketplace and will provide various other
reports from time to time as reasonably requested by the Board of Trustees
of the Trust; and


(d) will prepare and maintain such books and records with respect
to each Fund's securities and other transactions as required under
applicable law and will prepare and furnish the Trust's Board of Trustees
such periodic and special reports as the Board of Trustees may reasonably
request. The Adviser further agrees that all records which it maintains
for each Fund are the property of the Fund and the Adviser will surrender
promptly to the Fund any such records upon the request of the Fund
(provided, however, that Adviser shall be permitted to retain copies
thereof); and shall be permitted to retain originals (with copies to the
Fund) to the extent required under Rule 204-2 of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 or other applicable law.


8. Subject to applicable statutes and regulations, it is understood that
officers, Trustees, or agents of the Trust are, or may be, interested persons

(as such term is defined in the 1940 Act and rules and regulations thereunder)
of the Adviser as officers, directors, agents, shareholders or otherwise, and
that the officers, directors, shareholders and agents of the Adviser may be
interested persons of the Trust otherwise than as Trustees, officers or agents.


-4-





9. The Adviser shall not be liable for any loss sustained by reason of
the purchase, sale or retention of any asset, whether or not such purchase, sale
or retention shall have been based upon the investigation and research made by
any other individual, firm or corporation, if such recommendation shall have
been selected with due care and in good faith, except loss resulting from
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence on the part of the Adviser
in the performance of its obligations and duties, or by reason of its reckless
disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.


10. Subject to obtaining the initial and periodic approvals required under

Section 15 of the 1940 Act (after taking into effect any exemptive order,
no-action assurances or other relief, rule or regulation upon which the
respective Fund may rely), the Adviser may retain one or more sub-advisers at
the Adviser's own cost and expense for the purpose of furnishing one or more of
the services described in Section 1 hereof with respect to a Fund. In addition,
the Adviser may adjust from time to time the duties delegated to any
sub-adviser, the portion of portfolio assets of the Fund that the sub-adviser
shall manage and the fees to be paid to the sub-adviser pursuant to any
sub-advisory agreement or other arrangement entered into in accordance with this
Agreement, subject to the approvals set forth in Section 15 of the 1940 Act if
required after taking into account any exemptive order, no-action assurances or
other relief, rule or regulation upon which the respective Fund may rely.
Retention of one or more sub-advisers shall in no way reduce the
responsibilities or obligations of the Adviser under this Agreement and the
Adviser shall be responsible to a Fund for all acts or omissions of any
sub-adviser in connection with the performance of the Adviser's duties
hereunder. In addition, to the extent the respective Fund is relying on an
exemptive order or an amendment thereto permitting the Fund to hire one or more
sub-advisers or amend a sub-advisory agreement without shareholder approval, the
Adviser agrees to comply with any terms and conditions provided in such
exemptive order or amendment applicable to it.


11. The Trust acknowledges that the Adviser now acts, and intends in the
future to act, as an investment adviser to other managed accounts and as
investment adviser or sub-investment adviser to one or more other investment
companies that are not a series of the Trust. In addition, the Trust
acknowledges that the persons employed by the Adviser to assist in the Adviser's
duties under this Agreement will not devote their full time to such efforts. It
is also agreed that the Adviser may use any supplemental research obtained for
the benefit of the Trust in providing investment advice to its other investment
advisory accounts and for managing its own accounts.


12. This Agreement shall be effective on the date provided on Schedule A
for each respective Fund, provided it has been approved in the manner required
by the 1940 Act (after taking into effect any exemptive order, no action
assurances, or other relief, rule or regulation upon which the Trust may rely).
This Agreement shall continue in effect until the two-year anniversary of the
date of its effectiveness as to a Fund, unless and until terminated by either
party as hereinafter provided, and shall continue in force from year to year
thereafter, but only as long as such continuance is specifically approved, at
least annually, in the manner required by the 1940 Act (after taking into effect
any exemptive order, no action assurances, or other relief, rule or regulation
upon which the Trust may rely).


-5-





This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its
assignment, and may be terminated at any time without the payment of any penalty
by a Fund or by the Adviser upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other
party. Each Fund may effect termination by action of the Board of Trustees or by
vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, accompanied
by appropriate notice. This Agreement may be terminated, at any time, without
the payment of any penalty, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by vote of
a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Trust, in the event that
it shall have been established by a court of competent jurisdiction that the
Adviser, or any officer or director of the Adviser, has taken any action which
results in a breach of the material covenants of the Adviser set forth herein.
Termination of this Agreement shall not affect the right of the Adviser to
receive payments on any unpaid balance of the compensation, described in Section
3, earned prior to such termination and for any additional period during which
the Adviser serves as such for the Fund, subject to applicable law. The terms
"assignment" and "vote of the majority of outstanding voting securities" shall
have the same meanings set forth in the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.


13. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument
executed by both parties.


14. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or made invalid by a
court decision, statute, rule, or otherwise, the remainder shall not be thereby
affected.


15. Any notice under this Agreement shall be in writing, addressed and
delivered or mailed, postage prepaid, to the other party at such address as such
other party may designate for receipt of such notice.


16. All parties hereto are expressly put on notice of the Trust's
Declaration of Trust and all amendments thereto, a copy of which is on file with
the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the limitation of
shareholder and trustee liability contained therein. This Agreement is executed
on behalf of the Trust by the Trust's officers as officers and not individually
and the obligations imposed upon the Trust or a Fund by this Agreement are not
binding upon any of the Trust's Trustees, officers or shareholders individually
but are binding only upon the assets and property of the respective Fund, and
persons dealing with the Trust must look solely to the assets of such Fund for
the enforcement of any claims.


17. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with applicable
federal law and (except as to Section 16 hereof which shall be construed in
accordance with the laws of Massachusetts) the laws of the State of Illinois.


18. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of,
or enforceable by, any person or entity that is not a party hereto.


19. Any action brought on or with respect to this Agreement or any other
document executed in connection herewith or therewith by a party to this
Agreement against another party to this Agreement shall be brought only in a


-6-





court of competent jurisdiction in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, or if venue
does not lie in any such court only in a court of competent jurisdiction within
the State of Illinois (the "Chosen Courts"). Each party to this Agreement (a)
consents to jurisdiction in the Chosen Courts; (b) waives any objection to venue
in any of the Chosen Courts; and (c) waives any objection that any of the Chosen
Courts is an inconvenient forum. In any action commenced by a party hereto
against another party to the Agreement, there shall be no right to a jury trial.

THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS EXPRESSLY WAIVED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW.


-7-





IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Trust and the Adviser have caused this Agreement
to be executed on the day and year above written.

INVESTMENT SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT



This Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (this "Agreement"), made as of
February 4, 2016, by and among the First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund III, a
Massachusetts business trust (the "Trust"), First Trust Advisors L.P., an
Illinois limited partnership (the "Manager") and a registered investment adviser
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and RiverFront
Investment Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a registered
investment adviser with the SEC (the "Sub-Adviser").


WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the "1940 Act"), as an open-end management investment company;


WHEREAS, the Trust is authorized to issues shares in separate series, with
each series representing interests in a separate portfolio of securities and
other assets;


WHEREAS, the Trust intends to offer shares in the series set forth on
Schedule A attached hereto and any other series as to which this Agreement may
hereafter be made applicable and set forth on Schedule A, which may be amended
from time to time (each such series being herein referred to as a "Fund" and
collectively, the "Funds");


WHEREAS, the Trust has retained the Manager to serve as the investment
adviser for each Fund pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement, dated
February 4, 2016, between the Manager and the Trust (as such agreement may be
modified from time to time, the "Management Agreement");


WHEREAS, the Management Agreement provides that the Manager may, subject
to certain requirements, appoint a sub-adviser at its own cost and expense for
the purpose of furnishing certain services required under the Management
Agreement; and


WHEREAS, the Trust and the Manager desire to retain the Sub-Adviser to
furnish investment advisory services for each Fund's investment portfolio, upon
the terms and conditions hereafter set forth.


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained,
the parties hereto agree as follows:


1. Appointment. The Trust and the Manager hereby appoint the Sub-Adviser
to serve as sub-adviser to each Fund and to provide certain investment
sub-advisory services to each Fund for the period and on the terms set forth in
this Agreement and Schedule A. The Sub-Adviser accepts such appointment and
agrees to furnish the services herein set forth for the compensation set forth
in Schedule A. The Sub-Adviser shall, for all purposes herein provided, be
deemed an independent contractor and, unless otherwise expressly provided or
authorized, shall have no authority to act for nor represent the Trust, a Fund
or the Manager in any way, nor otherwise be deemed an agent of the Trust, a Fund
or the Manager.





2. Services to Be Performed. Subject always to the supervision of the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the "Board of Trustees") and the Manager, the
Sub-Adviser will act as sub-adviser for, and manage on a discretionary basis the
investment and reinvestment of the assets of each Fund allocated to the
Sub-Adviser from time to time, furnish an investment program in respect of, make
investment decisions for, and place all orders through the Manager for the
purchase and sale of securities and other assets for the respective Fund's
investment portfolio, all on behalf of such Fund and consistent with the Fund's
currently effective registration statement on Form N-1A as the same may
thereafter be amended from time to time. In the performance of its duties, the
Sub-Adviser will in all material respects (a) satisfy any applicable fiduciary
duties it may have to the Fund, (b) monitor the Fund's investments or other
instruments selected for the respective Fund by the Sub-Adviser, (c) comply with
the provisions of the Trust's Declaration of Trust and By-laws, as amended from
time to time and communicated by the Fund or the Manager to the Sub-Adviser in
writing, (d) comply with (i) the investment objectives, policies and
restrictions stated in the applicable Fund's most recently effective prospectus
and statement of additional information, (ii) such other investment objectives,
policies, restrictions or instructions as the Manager or the Trust's Board of
Trustees may communicate to the Sub-Adviser in writing, and (iii) any changes to
the objectives, policies, restrictions or instructions required under the
foregoing (i) and (ii) as communicated to the Sub-Adviser in writing, and (e)
assist in the valuation of portfolio assets held by the respective Fund as
requested by the Manager or the Fund. The Sub-Adviser and Manager will each make
its officers and employees available to the other from time to time at
reasonable times to review the investment objectives, policies and restrictions
of the applicable Fund and to consult with each other regarding the investment
affairs of such Fund. Each Fund or the Manager shall provide the Sub-Adviser
with current copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, the Trust's By-laws,
the Fund's prospectus, the Fund's statement of additional information and any
amendments thereto, and any policies or limitations not appearing therein as
they may be relevant to the Sub-Adviser's performance under this Agreement.


Unless otherwise approved by the Board and the Manager, the Sub-Adviser
shall have no authority to select brokers or dealers or otherwise place orders
for the execution of the purchases and sales of portfolio investments on behalf
of the Fund.


The Sub-Adviser will not arrange purchases or sales of securities or other
assets between a Fund and other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser or its
affiliates unless (a) such purchases or sales are in accordance with applicable
law (including if applicable Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act) and the Fund's
policies and procedures, (b) the Sub-Adviser determines the purchase or sale is
in the best interests of the Fund, and (c) the Board of Trustees has approved
these types of transactions.


The Sub-Adviser will communicate to the officers and Trustees of the Trust
such information relating to transactions for a Fund as they may reasonably
request. In no instance will a Fund's portfolio assets be purchased from or sold
to the Manager, the Sub-Adviser or any affiliated person of the Trust, the
Manager or the Sub-Adviser, except as may be permitted under the 1940 Act.





For purposes of complying with Rule 10f-3, Rule 12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and
Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that it will not
consult with any other sub-adviser of an investment company or a series of an
investment company that is advised by the Manager (the "First Trust Fund
Complex") or an affiliated person of a sub-adviser (including any sub-adviser
that is a principal underwriter or an affiliated person of such principal
underwriter), concerning transactions for a Fund or any fund in the First Trust
Fund Complex in securities or other fund assets. In addition, with respect to a
fund in the First Trust Fund Complex with multiple sub-advisers, the Sub-Adviser
shall be limited to providing investment advice with respect to only the
discrete portion of the fund's portfolio as may be determined from time to time
by the Board of Trustees or the Manager, and shall not consult with the
sub-adviser (including any sub-adviser that is a principal underwriter or an
affiliated person of such principal underwriter) as to any other portion of the
fund's portfolio concerning transactions for the fund in securities or other
assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions in this paragraph do not
apply to the consultations between the Sub-Adviser and any sub-adviser retained
by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to Section 4 hereunder.


The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it:


(a) will use the same degree of skill and care in providing such
services as it uses in providing services to other fiduciary accounts for
which it has investment responsibilities;


(b) will (i) conform in all material respects to all applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
("CFTC") and any other applicable regulatory authority, (ii) comply in all
material respects with all policies and procedures adopted by the Board of
Trustees for the Trust and communicated to the Sub-Adviser in writing, and

(iii) conduct its activities under this Agreement in all material respects
in accordance with any applicable law and regulations of any governmental
authority pertaining to its investment advisory, commodity pool operator
and commodity trading advisory activities;


(c) will report to the Manager and to the Board of Trustees on a
quarterly basis and will make appropriate persons available for the
purpose of reviewing with representatives of the Manager and the Board of
Trustees on a regular basis at such times as the Manager or the Board of
Trustees may reasonably request in writing regarding the management of the
respective Fund, including, without limitation, review of the general
investment strategies of the Fund, the performance of the Fund's
investment portfolio in relation to relevant standard industry indices and
general conditions affecting the marketplace and will provide various
other reports from time to time as reasonably requested by the Manager or
the Board of Trustees;


(d) will prepare and maintain such books and records with respect
to a Fund's assets and other transactions for the Fund's investment
portfolio as required for registered investment advisers performing such
services under applicable law, the Fund's compliance policies and
procedures or as otherwise requested by the Manager or the Board of
Trustees and will prepare and furnish the Manager and the Board of
Trustees such periodic and special reports as the Board of Trustees or the





Manager may request. Such records prepared and maintained by the
Sub-Adviser as required hereunder shall be open to inspection at all
reasonable times by the Manager or the Fund and any appropriate regulatory
authorities. The Sub-Adviser further agrees that all records that it
maintains for a Fund are the property of the Fund and the Sub-Adviser will
surrender promptly to such Fund any such records upon the request of the
Manager or the Fund (provided, however, that the Sub-Adviser shall be
permitted to retain copies thereof); and shall be permitted to retain
originals (with copies to the Fund) to the extent required under Rule
204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or other applicable law;
and


(e) will monitor events relating to the issuers of those assets and
the markets in which the securities or other assets trade in the ordinary
course of managing the portfolio investments of a Fund, and will notify
the Manager promptly of any issuer-specific or market events or other
situations that occur (particularly those that may occur after the close
of a foreign market in which the investments may primarily trade but
before the time at which the Fund's investments are priced on a given day)
that may materially impact the pricing of one or more securities or other
assets in the portfolio. In addition, the Sub-Adviser will at the
Manager's request assist the Manager in evaluating the impact that such an
event may have on the net asset value of a Fund and in determining a
recommended fair value of the affected investment or investments.


3. Expenses. During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will pay
all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities under this
Agreement other than the cost of securities and other assets (including, without
limitation, interest, taxes, dividend and distribution expenses from securities
sold short and all other expenses connected with the purchase, sale and
execution, of portfolio transactions, if any) purchased for a Fund.


4. Additional Sub-Advisers. Subject to obtaining the initial and periodic
approvals required under Section 15 of the 1940 Act (after taking into effect
any exemptive order, no-action assurances or other relief, rule or regulation
upon which the Fund may rely) and the approval of the Manager, the Sub-Adviser
may retain one or more additional sub-advisers at the Sub-Adviser's own cost and
expense for the purpose of furnishing one or more of the services described in

Section 2 hereof with respect to a Fund. Retention of a sub-adviser hereunder
shall in no way reduce the responsibilities or obligations of the Sub-Adviser
under this Agreement and the Sub-Adviser shall be responsible to the respective
Fund for all acts or omissions of any sub-adviser in connection with the
performance of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder.


5. Compensation. For the services provided and the expenses assumed
pursuant to this Agreement, the Manager will pay the Sub-Adviser, and the
Sub-Adviser agrees to accept as full compensation therefor, a sub-advisory fee
(the "Sub-Advisory Fee") equal to the annual percentage rate of the average
daily net assets of the respective Fund allocated to the Sub-Adviser set forth
in Schedule A. The Sub-Advisory Fee shall be payable in arrears on or about the
first day of each month during the term of this Agreement.





For the month and year in which this Agreement becomes effective or terminates,
there shall be an appropriate proration on the basis of the number of days that
this Agreement is in effect during the month and year, respectively.


6. Services to Others. The Trust and the Manager acknowledge that the
Sub-Adviser now acts, or may in the future act, as an investment adviser to
other managed accounts and as investment adviser or investment sub-adviser to
one or more other investment companies that are not series of the Trust. In
addition, the Trust and the Manager acknowledge that the persons employed by the
Sub-Adviser to assist in the Sub-Adviser's duties under this Agreement will not
devote their full time to such efforts. It is also agreed that the Sub-Adviser
may use any supplemental research obtained for the benefit of the Fund in
providing investment advice to its other investment advisory accounts and for
managing its own accounts.


7. Limitation of Liability. The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for, and
the Trust and the Manager will not take any action against the Sub-Adviser to
hold the Sub-Adviser liable for, any error of judgment or mistake of law or for
any loss suffered by a Fund or the Manager (including, without limitation, by
reason of the purchase, sale or retention of any security or other asset) in
connection with the performance of the Sub-Adviser's duties under this
Agreement, except for a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or
gross negligence on the part of the Sub-Adviser in the performance of its duties
under this Agreement, or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations
and duties under this Agreement.


8. Term; Termination. This Agreement shall become effective on the same
date as the Management Agreement between the Trust and the Manager becomes
effective with respect to the applicable Fund (it being understood that the
Manager shall notify the Sub-Adviser of the date of effectiveness of the
Management Agreement as soon as reasonably practical after effectiveness)
provided that it has been approved in the manner required by the 1940 Act (after
taking into effect any exemptive order, no-action assurances, or other relief,
rule or regulation upon which the Fund may rely), and shall remain in full force
until the two year anniversary of the date of its effectiveness unless sooner
terminated as hereinafter provided. This Agreement shall continue in force from
year to year thereafter, but only as long as such continuance is specifically
approved for the respective Fund at least annually in the manner required by the
1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (after taking into effect any
exemptive order, no-action assurances, or other relief, rule or regulation upon
which the Fund may rely); provided, however, that if the continuation of this
Agreement is not approved for the respective Fund, the Sub-Adviser may continue
to serve in such capacity for such Fund in the manner and to the extent
permitted by the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.


This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its
assignment and may be terminated at any time without the payment of any penalty
by the Manager or the Sub-Adviser upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the
other parties. This Agreement may also be terminated by a Fund by action of the
Board of Trustees or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of such Fund upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the Sub-Adviser
by the Fund without payment of any penalty; provided, however, termination of
this Agreement by one Fund will not terminate this Agreement for the other
Funds.





This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the payment of any
penalty by the Manager, the Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the applicable Fund in the event that it shall
have been established by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Sub-Adviser
or any officer or director of the Sub-Adviser has taken any action that results
in a breach of the material covenants of the Sub-Adviser set forth herein.


The terms "assignment" and "vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities" shall have the meanings set forth in the 1940 Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.


This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event the Management
Agreement between the Manager and the Trust on behalf of the applicable Fund is
terminated, assigned or not renewed.


Termination of this Agreement shall not affect the right of the
Sub-Adviser to receive payments on any unpaid balance of the compensation
described in Section 5 earned or accrued prior to such termination and for any
additional period during which the Sub-Adviser serves as such for the Fund,
subject to applicable law.


9. Compliance Certification. From time to time, the Sub-Adviser shall
provide such certifications with respect to Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, as
are reasonably requested by a Fund or the Manager. In addition, the Sub-Adviser
will, from time to time, provide a written assessment of its compliance program
in conformity with current industry standards that is reasonably acceptable to
the Fund to enable the Fund to fulfill its obligations under Rule 38a-1 under
the 1940 Act.


10. Notice. Any notice under this Agreement shall be sufficient in all
respects if given in writing and delivered by commercial courier providing proof
of delivery and addressed as follows or addressed to such other person or
address as such party may designate for receipt of such notice.

the limitation of shareholder and Trustee liability contained therein and a copy
of which has been provided to the Sub-Adviser prior to the date hereof. This
Agreement is executed by the Trust on behalf of each Fund by the Trust's
officers in their capacity as officers and not individually and is not binding
upon any of the Trustees, officers or shareholders of the Trust individually but
the obligations imposed upon the Trust or a Fund by this Agreement are binding
only upon the assets and property of the respective Fund, and persons dealing





with the Trust or a Fund must look solely to the assets of such Fund for the
enforcement of any claims.


12. Miscellaneous. The captions in this Agreement are included for
convenience of reference only and in no way define or delimit any of the
provisions hereof or otherwise affect their construction or effect. This
Agreement will be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors.


13. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
applicable federal law and (except as to Section 11 hereof, which shall be
construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) the
laws of the State of Illinois.

modified or waived, in a writing signed by the party against which such
amendment, modification or waiver is sought to be enforced.

authorized and fully empowered to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement.
The Trust represents that engagement of the Sub-Adviser has been duly authorized
by the Trust and is in accordance with the Trust's Declaration of Trust and
other governing documents of the applicable Fund.


16. Third Party Beneficiaries. None of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be for the benefit of, or enforceable by, any person or entity that is not
a party hereto.


17. Forum Selection. Any action brought on or with respect to this
Agreement or any other document executed in connection herewith or therewith by
a party to this Agreement against another party to this Agreement shall be
brought only in a court of competent jurisdiction in Chicago, Cook County,
Illinois, or if venue does not lie in any such court only in a court of
competent jurisdiction within the State of Illinois (the "Chosen Courts"). Each
party to this Agreement (a) consents to jurisdiction in the Chosen Courts; (b)
waives any objection to venue in any of the Chosen Courts; and (c) waives any
objection that any of the Chosen Courts is an inconvenient forum. In any action
commenced by a party hereto against another party to the Agreement, there shall
be no right to a jury trial. THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS EXPRESSLY WAIVED TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.


18. Severability. Each provision of this Agreement is intended to be
severable from the others so that if any provision or term hereof is illegal or
invalid for any reason whatsoever, such illegality or invalidity shall not

Re:   First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund III


Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have acted as special Massachusetts counsel to First Trust
Exchange-Traded Fund III (the "Trust") on behalf of its series First Trust
RiverFront Dynamic Asia Pacific ETF, First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Developed
International ETF and First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Europe ETF(each, a "Fund")
in connection with the Trust's Post-Effective Amendment to its Registration
Statement on Form N-1A to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on or about April 14, 2016 (as so amended, the "Registration Statement") with
respect to each Fund's shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share
(collectively, the "Shares"). You have requested that we deliver this opinion to
you in connection with the Trust's filing of such Registration Statement.


In connection with the furnishing of this opinion, we have examined the
following documents:


(a) a certificate of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts as to the existence of the Trust;


(b) a copy, stamped as filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts on January 9, 2008, of the Trust's Declaration of Trust
dated as of January 9, 2008 (the "Declaration");


(c) a copy of Trust's Amended and Restated Establishment and
Designation of Series, effective as of March 9, 2016, as filed with the
Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on March 14, 2016 (the
"Designation");


(d) a certificate executed by an appropriate officer of the Trust,
certifying as to, and attaching copies of, the Trust's Declaration,





First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund III

Chapman and Cutler LLP

April 14, 2016



Page 2 of 3


Designation, By-Laws, and certain resolutions adopted by the Trustees of
the Trust at a meeting held on February 1, 2016 (the "Resolutions"); and


(e) a draft of the Registration Statement received on April 11,
2016.


In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures,
the conformity to the originals of all of the documents reviewed by us as
copies, the authenticity and completeness of all original documents reviewed by
us in original or copy form and the legal competence of each individual
executing any document. We note that the resolutions adopted by the Trust's
Trustees on February 1, 2016, as attached to the certificate referenced in
paragraph (d) above and reviewed by us in connection with rendering this
opinion, are in draft form, and we have assumed for the purposes of this opinion
that the resolutions, when included in the minutes of such meeting and finalized
and approved by the Trustees, will be in substantially the form attached to such
certificate. We have also assumed that the Registration Statement, as filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, will be in substantially the form of
filing referred to in paragraph (e) above. We have further assumed that the
Trust's Declaration, Designation, By-Laws and the Resolutions will not have been
amended, modified or withdrawn with respect to matters relating to the Shares
and will be in full force and effect on the date of the issuance of such Shares.


This opinion is based entirely on our review of the documents listed above
and such investigation of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate. We
have made no other review or investigation of any kind whatsoever, and we have
assumed, without independent inquiry, the accuracy of the information set forth
in such documents.


As to any opinion below relating to the due formation or existence of the
Trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, our opinion relies
entirely upon and is limited by the certificate of public officials referred to
in (a) above.


This opinion is limited solely to the internal substantive laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as applied by courts located in Massachusetts
(other than Massachusetts securities laws, as to which we express no opinion),
to the extent that the same may apply to or govern the transactions referred to
herein. No opinion is given herein as to the choice of law which any tribunal
may apply to such transaction. In addition, to the extent that the Trust's
Declaration, Designation or By-Laws refer to, incorporate or require compliance
with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or any other law or
regulation applicable to the Trust, except for the internal substantive laws of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as aforesaid, we have assumed compliance by
the Trust with such Act and such other laws and regulations.


We understand that all of the foregoing assumptions and limitations are
acceptable to you.


Based upon and subject to the foregoing, please be advised that it is our
opinion that:


1. The Trust has been formed and is existing under the Trust's Declaration
of Trust and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a voluntary
association with transferable shares of beneficial interest commonly referred to
as a "Massachusetts business trust."

2. The Shares, when issued and sold in accordance with the Trust's
Declaration, Designation and the Resolutions and for the consideration described
in the Registration Statement, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, except that, as set forth in the Registration Statement,
shareholders of the Trust may under certain circumstances be held personally
liable for its obligations.


This opinion is given as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to
update this opinion to reflect any changes in law or any other facts or
circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention. We hereby consent to
your reliance on this opinion in connection with your opinion to the Trust with
respect to the Shares and to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement. In rendering this opinion and giving this consent, we do
not concede that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required
under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.


Very truly yours,

Re:          First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund III




Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have served as counsel for the First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund III
(the "Trust"), which proposes to offer and sell shares of its series (the
"Shares"), First Trust RiverFront Dynamic Asia Pacific ETF, First Trust
RiverFront Dynamic Developed International ETF and First Trust RiverFront
Dynamic Europe ETF (each, a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds"), in the manner
and on the terms set forth in Post-Effective Amendment No. 41 and Amendment No.
42 to its Registration Statement on Form N-1A filed on or about April 14, 2016
(the "Amendment") with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, respectively.


In connection therewith, we have examined such pertinent records and
documents and matters of law, including the opinion of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius
LLP issued to the Trust or Trust's counsel upon which we have relied as they
relate to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as we have deemed
necessary in order to enable us to express the opinion hereinafter set forth.


Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


The Shares of the Funds may be issued from time to time in accordance with
the Trust's Declaration of Trust dated January 9, 2008 and the Trust's By-Laws,
and subject to compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and applicable state laws regulating
the sale of securities and the receipt by the Funds of the purchase price of not
less than the net asset value per Share, and such Shares, when so issued and
sold by the Funds, will be legally issued, fully paid and non-assessable, except
that, as set forth in the Amendment, shareholders of a Fund may under certain
circumstances be held personally liable for its obligations.

We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement (File No. 333-176976) relating to the Shares referred to
above, to the use of our name and to the reference to our firm in said
Registration Statement.


Respectfully submitted,
