Scott Brown has been a part of The John Roberts family for twenty-nine years.  Scott began his career in 1986 when his father, former Vikings player, Bill “Boom-Boom” Brown needed help servicing his accounts.  Knowing the Keene family and in honoring his father, Scott came aboard as a Customer Service Representative which slowly evolved into a “hybrid” of Customer Service and Sales.  In 1996 Scott transitioned into a full-time Sales role where he has resided as an Account Executive ever since.
Spending time working in production in the plant setting helped Scott build a strong and knowledgeable framework for being well-rounded in the sales profession. He has strong and rewarding relationships with both his fellow co-workers and customers who have been paramount in his success.
Keeping his customers happy, garnering work for the company and providing for his family are the things that Scott values the most. 
A huge music fan, Scott has always enjoyed a good concert.  He also relishes time with his wife Donna, 2 grown boys and any time spent on the golf course.

Description


Additional information



Description
John Brown gained attention during the Bleeding Kansas crisis when he led a group of abolitionists to Kansas and killed five pro-slavery Southerners.  This was in retaliation for the raid on the “free soil” city of Lawrence, Kansas.  By 1859 Brown believed an armed insurrection was the only way to overthrow the institution of slavery.  His unsuccessful raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, to gather arms and inspire a uprising of black slaves, ended in a bloody shoot-out that killed ten people and injured ten more.  This incident was known as the Pottawatomie Massacre.  He was tried and hanged for his role in the raid.  Historians credit him with solidifying the differences between the North and the South, which led to secession and the Civil War.  The song John Brown’s Body was a popular Union Army marching song.
This John Brown mug is part of our US Civil War series profiling participants in the War Between the States.  Thousands of Confederate and Union soldiers fought in battles such as Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Cold Harbor and Petersburg.  We honor their sacrifices by telling their stories.
The content on the mugs is crafted for a stunning visual experience and to inspire an interest to learn more about history.  Robert Compton, who developed History Mugs colorized the hundred-year-old photographs in order to bring the individuals back to life.  Biography and images are designed and printed in Bristol, Vermont, USA.

11 oz. mug:  3.75” H x 3” D
15 oz. mug:  4.5″ H x 3.25″ D
Mugs are premium hard coated ceramic, which are food and microwave safe.
To preserve photographic quality we recommend hand washing.
Mugs are usually shipped within 3-5 days.
Shipping charges drop dramatically on orders of 8 or more.
