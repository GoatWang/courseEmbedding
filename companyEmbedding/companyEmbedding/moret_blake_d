MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) announced today that its board of 
      directors has elected Blake D. Moret, a 30-year veteran of the Company, 
      as president and chief executive officer, effective July 1, 2016. At 
      that time Keith D. Nosbusch, 65, who has been president and chief 
      executive officer since 2004, will transition from those roles while 
      continuing as chairman of the board. Moret, 53, is currently senior vice 
      president of the Company’s Control Products & Solutions segment.
    


      Donald R. Parfet, Lead Director, said: “Blake has proven himself to be 
      an exceptional leader, with demonstrated readiness to lead the company. 
      We welcome him to his new role at the conclusion of a deliberate and 
      planned succession process. We are delighted he will build on the 
      Company’s many accomplishments under Keith’s direction and propel our 
      vision of The Connected Enterprise to the next level.”
    

      “The past 12 years have been transformational for Rockwell Automation,” 
      Parfet continued. “We’ve become a global technology leader and the 
      world’s largest company dedicated to industrial automation and 
      information. Equally important, we are well positioned to accelerate our 
      evolution with industry-leading innovation that improves our customers’ 
      global competitiveness.”
    

      “We thank Keith for his outstanding leadership during this period, 
      including his work as a vocal champion of smart, productive, and secure 
      manufacturing. We are pleased that he has agreed to stay on as chairman 
      so that the Company can continue to benefit from his experience and 
      support Blake’s transition to CEO.”
    

      Nosbusch said: “It has been an honor and privilege to lead Rockwell 
      Automation over the past 12 years. While as a team we enjoyed tremendous 
      success, I have no doubt that we are well positioned for an even greater 
      future. Blake is the ideal executive to move Rockwell Automation forward 
      in its next chapter. He brings a strong customer focus, as well as a 
      deep understanding of the Company’s values, culture, people, and 
      technology, and how each of these power the Company’s success.”
    

      Moret said: “I am honored to have the opportunity to lead Rockwell 
      Automation and its talented employees into an exciting future. We have a 
      deep management team, unmatched technology solutions, domain expertise 
      across a broad range of industries, and enduring customer relationships 
      around the world. We are committed to continue to deliver customer and 
      shareowner value in the years ahead.”
    

      Moret has 30 years of experience in sales and business management roles 
      in product, services, and solutions businesses across Rockwell 
      Automation. He began his career in 1985 as a sales trainee, and 
      subsequently served in senior positions across the organization, 
      including international assignments in Europe and Canada. In 2011, he 
      was named senior vice president of Control Products & Solutions, one of 
      the Company’s two business segments, with FY15 sales of $3.6 billion.
    

      Moret is a graduate of Georgia Institute of Technology, where he earned 
      a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. He has served as Chair of 
      the Board of the Manufacturing Institute of the National Association of

      for the Milwaukee-based Urban Ecology Center, the Board of Directors of
