I gave birth here at Virtua in Voorhees back in 2007. The room was nice and spacious, clean and organized. Plus the food was really good. Cons: The service was TERRIBLE! I had gotten attitudes from all the nurses I saw on top of one not knowing basic rules about IV's. The OB's I worked with for this Hospital sucked as well. They didn't bother to take the time and explain things to me and induced me rather than explaining to me that I could go home and wait longer. So over all...I would NOT recommend this hospital to go to when delivering a baby. South Shore Plastic Surgerytanigrl6 ratedDr. Vasisht was great, and he ...Dr. Vasisht was great, and he was very helpful! His office staff on the other hand, I would not go to again because of the office staff alone! I will not recommend him to anyone because every time I spoke to his office staff I received an attitude! They were not personable and should not be working with people. Its a shame, but when you have to deal with the office staff as much as you do its not worth it. I think that there are plenty of other plastic sergons out there with a nice office staff. Barbara WinfieldJackie S. ratedDr Winfield listens to her patients and takes how ever much time is needed to help. She is caring and shows true compassion and genuine concern.  She treats you as a person, not as a statistic or as cattle. She works with her patients, never rushing them or ignoring their questions.  Dr. Winfield is an absolute gem.Virtua Breast Specialtycourtney92 ratedVery short on the phone when you make an appointment. They called my cell phone from a number I did not recognize and did not leave a voicemail. A voicemail was important seeing as it was to remind of my appointment. I find this business to be unprofessional. The doctors are great but the office staff is rude. Barbara WinfieldLynn C. ratedAwesome DoctorDr. Winfield is a great doctor. She listens to what you are telling her and will ask you questions about what you just told her. She pays special attention to the facts and addresses the issues. I am really going to miss her and I am so thankful to have met her and to have had her as my family doctor.Virtua Breast Specialty Carecourtney92 ratedVery short on the phone when making appointments.

All info available.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

MeadWestvaco, Rock-Tenn Fold Into $8B Packaging Company









Lou Whiteman




Jan 26, 2015 10:42 AM EST













 


























































 NEW YORK ( The Deal) -- MeadWestvaco  ( MWV) and Rock-Tenn ( RKT) said Monday they intend to combine in a deal that values each at more than $8 billion and would create the world's second-largest packaging manufacturer.   Terms of the deal call for MeadWestvaco holders to receive 0.78 shares of the new company for each share held, while RockTenn holders can elect either one share of the merged entity or a cash amount equal to the volume weighted average price of RockTenn shares around the time of close. The elections are to be prorated in such a way that MWV holders will own about 50.1% of the new company, meaning about 7% of RockTenn holders are to receive cash.   Post-deal the combination, which has yet to be named, will have RockTenn CEO Steven C. Voorhees as chief executive and current MeadWestvaco chief John A. Luke Jr. set to become non-executive chairman. The post-deal board will include eight RockTenn directors and six from MeadWestvaco, with the merged company keeping MeadWestvaco's Richmond headquarters and housing an operating office at RockTenn's Norcross, Ga., home base.   The combined company would have annual Ebitda of about $2.9 billion on sales of $15.7 billion, including about $300 million in expected cost savings, creating a global packaging powerhouse. Together the companies would rank as the second-largest global packaging firm in terms of sales, trailing only International Paper  ( IP) .   "This transaction brings together two highly complementary organizations to create a new, more powerful company with leadership positions in the global consumer and corrugated packaging markets," Voorhees said. "This is a terrific opportunity for shareholders, employees and customers of both companies, all of whom stand to benefit enormously from the combination."   The deal comes just weeks after MeadWestvaco, which has been under pressure from activist Starboard Value, said that it was spinning off its specialty chemicals business to shareholders. Starboard, which as of December owned 6.1% of MeadWestvaco, had called on the company to also seek to monetize real estate assets and address what it called MWV's "overfunded" pension plan, among other criticisms.   The companies said Monday that they are targeting MeadWestvaco owning 50.1% of the combination to facilitate the continued favorable tax attributes of the planned spin, which is to be completed after the merger closes.   Luke, current CEO of MeadWestvaco, in a statement said that the deal is "a logical step that is borne of our strategic progress and financial success, and it offers MWV shareholders both immediate value and the opportunity to participate in significant upside as the new company generates substantial growth from its market-focused global strategy."   Starboard had no immediate comment on Monday's announcement. Investors are believed to have until Wednesday, January 28, to nominate candidates to MeadWestvaco's board, a step Starboard according to sources was strongly considering prior to the merger agreement.   RockTenn was advised by Blackstone Advisory Partners LP, with Lazard's Donald Fawcett and William Lewis providing a fairness opinion to RockTenn's board and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP acting as legal counsel. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP partners Barbara Becker and Dennis Friedman advised Lazard.   MeadWestvaco received financial advice from a Bank of America Merrill Lynch team of Ravi Sinha, Joseph Messina, Kevin England, Bobby Connell and Ashrika Kohli along with Goldman, Sachs & Co., with Greenhill issuing a fairness opinion to the board and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz providing legal advice.
