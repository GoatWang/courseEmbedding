History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

Avon Products, Inc, known as Avon, is an American international manufacturer and direct selling company in beauty, household, and personal care categories. Avon had annual sales of $10.0 billion worldwide in 2013.[2]
It is the fifth-largest beauty company and, with 6.4 million representatives, is the second largest direct selling enterprise in the world (after Amway).[4] Avon Products is a multi-level marketing company.[5] The company's CEO is Sherilyn S. McCoy, who was appointed to the position in April 2012.[6] The former CEO, Andrea Jung, became the executive chairman of the board. Recently, Avon has struggled with the global sales falling for five straight years and North American revenues falling 18% in 2014.[7]
In 2016, Avon completed the sale of the remainder of its American business. All of its operations are now outside the United States. As part of a three-year plan, Avon will also move its headquarters to the United Kingdom.[8]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

Avon Products, Inc, known as Avon, is an American international manufacturer and direct selling company in beauty, household, and personal care categories. Avon had annual sales of $10.0 billion worldwide in 2013.[2]
It is the fifth-largest beauty company and, with 6.4 million representatives, is the second largest direct selling enterprise in the world (after Amway).[4] Avon Products is a multi-level marketing company.[5] The company's CEO is Sherilyn S. McCoy, who was appointed to the position in April 2012.[6] The former CEO, Andrea Jung, became the executive chairman of the board. Recently, Avon has struggled with the global sales falling for five straight years and North American revenues falling 18% in 2014.[7]
In 2016, Avon completed the sale of the remainder of its American business. All of its operations are now outside the United States. As part of a three-year plan, Avon will also move its headquarters to the United Kingdom.[8]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

Our History 
 




history of it works!


IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
It Works!® started in 2001 and is now debt-free and expanding all over the world. But no matter how big we grow, we'll always do things at It Works! our way: the It Works! way.







1995 FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
It Works! was born out of Mark & Cindy Pentecost’s passion to offer families like yours the opportunity to dream big, to begin living life in your own terms—because they too had those dreams once themselves.
Long before the founding of It Works! Global, Mark was a high school teacher and basketball coach in the small town of Allegan, Michigan. Cindy was a stay-at-home mom with their three children, a job of the utmost importance that the family took great pride in her doing.  They were rich in love and filled with dreams, but struggling to make ends meet financially.
So Mark & Cindy devised a plan: an extra $500 a month, to be earned through a home-based business opportunity in the telecommunications industry.
After months of evening hours dedicated to their new side business, the Pentecosts’ earnings grew far beyond the goal they had originally set. After a few years, Mark became a top-ten earner in the company, bought the family’s freedom, and began to dream of the next big challenge: helping other families do the same.  They weren’t sure how they would do it yet, but the seed had been planted for It Works! Global.









2001 THE ULTIMATE BODY APPLICATOR
"The biggest challenge in this industry—and really the worldwide market—is to offer an uncommon solution, a true original, that captivates people and offers them something they never thought possible before.  When we found the Ultimate Body Applicator, we knew we had something special to share with the world.” - Mark Pentecost, CEO It Works! Global
To this day, It Works!’ first product is still its most popular: The Ultimate Body Applicator.  The site-specific body contouring treatment has been in the hands of celebrities at Hollywood events and at the doorsteps of people like you all over the world—exclusively available through It Works! Global.
It all started when Mark Pentecost received a call from Pam Sowder (now It Works! Chief Networking Officer) raving about a product that was an alternative to the growing trend for more drastic measures like cosmetic surgeries or constricting shapewear.
When the Pentecosts traveled to try this seemingly unbelievable product, Mark recalls, “I watched my wife try it. She was ecstatic with the results, and I watched her call her girlfriend right away to tell her what had happened.  Her girlfriend said that she wanted to try it, and they hung up.  It wasn't 30 seconds later, her girlfriend called back and said, ‘My daughter was listening, and she wants one for her chin. Is there something for the chin?' That was when I knew that we had a perfect product for direct selling, a product that people would be excited to share with their friends and family."
Since then, the Ultimate Body Applicator has become a global phenomenon, and Pam Sowder now travels all over the world to meet with distributors, give hands-on training and support, and share the Ultimate Body Applicator.







2001 THE MIND BEHIND THE MAGIC
A product so special as the Ultimate Body Applicator could only come from a mind that is both brilliant and passionate about the use of safe, natural ingredients: Luis Mijares.  Luis, the formulator behind the It Works! body contouring and skin care products, has been a friend and business partner to Mark Pentecost since their first introduction in 2001.
Luis' passion for research and development in the skin care, nutritional, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries began when he was a child, learning natural remedies from his grandmother in Mexico.  His abundant credentials, including his experience as the CEO of a top pharmaceutical company, his international reknown as an herbalist and university educator of phytotherapy (the uses of plants for medicinal purposes), along with his keen personal interest in natural solutions made Luis the ideal candidate for the It Works! Product Development Specialist.









2005 THE IT WORKS! PREMIUM SUPPLEMENTS   	LINE
The It Works! premium supplements line began when Mark made a routine visit to his doctor’s office several years ago. On this visit, Mark’s doctor instructed him to start taking a daily multi-vitamin supplement. But when Mark asked his doctor which one he should take, he was taken aback by the physician’s response: “I don’t know, but I wouldn’t take a cheap one. You only live once!" 
"I didn't know what to do with that," recalls Mark. "You want to know that you're putting the very best things in your body, so I began the long and hard search for the best multi-vitamin on the market."
Mark took a trip to a local nutrition store looking for answers. Sales people swarmed after him. Vitamins filled the shelves, all claiming different benefits. Over an hour later, Mark left feeling more confused than when he had gone in, overwhelmed with options. Next, he began asking his friends which vitamins they were taking. Some made their choices because the vitamin had a nice package. Others simply looked for a mid-priced vitamin, unsure of what exactly they were putting in their bodies. And others picked up the most expensive item, hoping that it was, in fact, the very best for them. 
"The more I got into the education of a vitamin, I started learning more about what's all natural versus synthetic," says Mark. "A lot of times you'd find that a product might have 100-200 ingredients, but there wasn't enough of each ingredient for the product to actually do what the clinicals showed they could do. You want something foundational that you know has the key ingredients to help keep us healthy and be the best we can be."
Eventually, Mark's search brought him to meet Don VerHulst, MD, a doctor with an extensive background in researching the effects of nutrition and natural remedies on today's common health issues. Mark and Dr. Don worked together to kick off the It Works! premium dietary supplements line with It's Vital, an advanced formula multi-vitamin, mineral, and enzyme supplement with all the known nutrients the body needs on a daily basis.
In his pursuit to find the best vitamin to keep his own body healthy, Mark has made it possible for you to have access to the same superior formula for yourself and your family. This standard of providing the best quality supplements on the market has carried through all our product formulations and remains the driving force behind the It Works! dietary supplements line.
Today, the It Works supplements line is a comprehensive collection of nutritional solutions for real people like you to help you combat the elements and stay healthy, and Dr. Don travels around the world with Chief Networking Officer Pam Sowder to teach on the benefits of the It Works! supplements and spread his message of ten easy steps to better health.
We proudly stand behind our commitment to nutritional supplements that contain the highest quality ingredients, offering you real, life-changing results at affordable prices. Whether you’re looking to reduce stress, lose weight, get top-notch nutrition, regulate your digestive system, or turn back the hands of time from the inside out, there is a solution for you in the It Works! supplements line.








2009 GROWING THROUGH A TOUGH ECONOMY
The economic crisis that began in 2009 presented many families and businesses across the world with devastating cirumstances.  We at It Works! feel very fortunate to have been able to be a source of hope for families in need during such difficult years through our steadfast business opportunity.
Despite the grim economy, It Works! became debt-free in 2009, and sales began to reach unprecendented heights.   








2010 REACHING INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
In 2010, It Works! expanded into Australia and select areas of Europe, and the company continued to break new records throughout the year.
"We have been blessed with products and an opportunity that not only withstood the financial market of recent years, but sales have skyrocketed from 2009 onward," says Mark. "We want to pour hope and goodness into people's lives through our product solutions and the It Works! opportunity, and we continue to be honored to be able to touch the lives of more and more people every year."








2011 A NEW HEADQUARTERS & FAMILY DESTINATION
In 2011, It Works! Global made the move from Grand Rapids, Michigan where it all began to a beautiful new home in Bradenton, Florida.  The corporate headquarters is nestled in a thriving community, just 20 minutes away from multiple world-class beaches and only a short mile down the road from It Works!' new sister company: Stoneybrook Golf Club of Bradenton.
Always ready for a competitive game of golf, Mark had long held the dream of owning his own golf course.  But a larger part of that dream was to have a place to share laughter and good times with the It Works! family, both corporate and distributors alike.
"It's been so much fun to have distributors out for leadership meetings at the beach, to host games at Stoneybrook, and to have everyone out here for company-wide Green Carpet Days where we treat distributors from all over the world to a good time," says Mark. "We look forward to many years of fun and fellowship at our Florida facilities."
The last ten years have been full of great memories, but we're just getting started.  The next ten years will be about you and your family, the differences you will see in your own life and the changes you will impact in the lives of others. 
See It Works! through the eyes of some of our distributors who have been with us for years, check out the It Works! opportunity, or shop our amazing product line. We look forward to meeting you and hearing your story next!








2012 It Works! reaches $100 million sales goal
It Works! reaches $100 million sales goal, then doubles it.  The G.O.O.D. bonus and new mantra “Debt Free Is the New Sexy” are introduced to align the field with the corporate philosophy of debt freedom.  With a 690 percent growth rate over three years, the company plans new, larger corporate headquarters.








2013 It Works! reaches $450 million mark 
 A history of exponential growth continues as It Works! reaches the $450 million mark.  The leadership team continues to focus on creating jobs while being the beacon of hope for those seeking to improve their health, appearance and lifestyle.
