Investments in the Fidelity VIP Government Money Market Portfolio are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. During extended periods of low interest rates, and partly as a result of asset based separate account charges, the yield on this investment option may become low and possibly negative. Although the underlying fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Portfolio. The 7-day yield quotation is net of all recurring contract fees and charges, is prorated and more closely reflects the current earnings of the Money Market Fund than the total return quotation. 


Investments in the Guardian Investor IISM Variable Annuity or any of its investment options are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or endorsed by any bank or depository institution; further, neither the contract nor such investments are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), the Federal Reserve Board, or any other government agency. 


Investments in any of the variable investment options involve risk, including the possible loss of principal. This information is authorized for use with the public only when preceded or accompanied by a prospectus for the Guardian Investor IISM Variable Annuity. 


                        Performance data quoted is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the underlying securities. Contract owner units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment.

                        Charges and expenses for the B Series option of this variable annuity include: a) the investment division charges consisting of fund-level expenses, which are similar to the charges on traditional mutual funds (these fees range from 0.28% to 1.33% for the year ended 12/31/11 after giving effect to applicable fee waivers, expense reimbursements or reductions, offset arrangements, or custody credits; in the absence of such arrangements these fees would be higher), b) the separate account level charges consisting of the annual mortality and expense risk charge (M&E charge) of 1.15% and the administrative charge of 0.25%, and c) contract level charges consisting of: i) the $35.00 annual contract fee (fee is waived for contracts with an accumulation value over
						$100,000), and ii) for Non-Standardized Average Annual Total Returns (adjusted for all charges) and Standardized Average Annual Total Returns only, the contract’s contingent deferred sales charge. The contract’s contingent deferred sales charge is a percentage of the amount withdrawn, in excess of any free withdrawal amount, that consists of premiums that were paid into your contract during the seven years prior to the date of the withdrawal. The charge declines annually over a seven year period based on the number of full years completed since the premium payment was made in accordance with the following schedule: 8%, 7.5%, 6.5%, 5.5%, 5%, 4% and 3% from the date of the premium payment, respectively. After a premium payment has been in the contract for seven years, the charge is zero


                        Please note that performance results for contractowners who elect an enhanced death benefit or other optional rider would be lower if the charges for these features were reflected. These charges are as follows: for the Highest Anniversary Value Death Benefit Rider, 0.40% of variable investment option assets; for the Earnings Benefit Rider, 0.25% of variable investment option assets; for the Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Rider (GLWB) single life options, a current charge of 0.95% to 1.30% (1.00% to 2.50% maximum) of the adjusted guaranteed withdrawal balance at the time the charge is deducted and, for the GLWB Rider with spousal options, a current charge of 1.05% to 1.55% (2.00% - 3.50% maximum) of the adjusted guaranteed withdrawal balance at the time the charge is deducted. The optional
						death benefit features of the GLWB Rider will increase the rider percentage fee by 0.50% (GLWB Step-Up Death Benefit) or 0.60% (GLWB Return of Premium Death Benefit) annually.
                    

The following funds have asset-based distribution fees (12b-1 fees) that were imposed on the dates noted. Returns for these funds prior to the dates on which these fees were imposed do not include the effects of the 12b-1fees and returns listed would have been lower for these funds if these fees had been in place and reflected in the performance. All time periods for any funds not listed below reflect the effects of any applicable 12b-1 fees.

Risk Disclosure/ Footnotes
                        Certain portfolios may have similar investment objectives and policies and, in some cases, similar names to retail mutual funds managed by the same manager. The portfolios named are not the same funds as the retail funds. As a result, specific investments may be different and investment results may be higher or lower. While all funds involve some risk, including possible loss of principal amount invested, there are some additional risks to consider when investing in certain types of funds or certain types of asset classes that comprise a fund’s portfolio. For further information on risks associated with the various funds see the fund prospectuses.
                    

[A] Foreign Securities and Emerging Markets Risk. Investing in International funds or funds that invest any of their assets in foreign securities has special risks relating to changes in currency rates, foreign taxation, differences in auditing and other financial standards, political uncertainty and greater volatility. These risks are even greater when investing in emerging markets.
                    

[B] Small Cap and Mid Cap Companies Risk. Risks associated with investments in small and mid cap companies include less publicly available information, higher volatility, and less liquidity than investments in larger companies.
                    

[C] Concentration Risk Investments concentrated in specific industries, market segments, regions or securities may be subject to increased share price volatility.
                    

[D] Debt Securities Risk. Investing in Bond funds or funds that invest any of their assets in debt securities exposes the contractowner to the general risks of investing in debt markets, such as interest rate, credit, and prepayment risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, bond prices rise. Therefore, an increase in interest rates would decrease the value of a bond fund’s holdings. The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security’s maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change. Duration is a measure of bond price sensitivity to a given change in interest rates. Generally, the longer a bond’s duration, the greater is its price sensitivity to a change in interest rates.
						However, low duration bond funds are not an alternative to money market funds. Low duration bond funds, unlike money market funds, do not seek to maintain a stable net asset value and as a result are a riskier asset class.
                    

[E] High Yield Debt Securities Risk. Investments in high yield bonds or lower rated and unrated debt securities are subject to greater credit risk and price fluctuation than investments in higher-rated securities.
                    

[F] Derivatives Risk. Since the value of a derivative instrument derives from an underlying asset, the use of derivatives involves risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid, and difficult to value.
