Welcome to feeney




















For more than 60 years, Feeney has pioneered industry-leading architectural and rigging products. Our products are both innovative and easy to install for professionals and DIY homeowners alike.
Learn more about Feeney, Inc.



Feeney means qualityThere are many ways in which our quality is superior.  For instance, we use type 316 marine-grade stainless steel for our cables and fittings and high strength 6000 series aluminum with state-of-the-art powder coating finishes for our railings and trellis. And, our product review and testing procedures are comprehensive and meticulous, ensuring consistent quality and performance.



Not only do we have a commitment to quality, we also have a firm commitment to the environment. Read Feeney's environmental statement

Feeney makes it easyDoing business with us is easy from beginning to end. It is quick and uncomplicated to research, order, and install our products and to get customer support if you need it.

Over the years, we have worked closely with our customers to understand their needs and provide trouble-free solutions.  Many of our staff have worked in the building trades, and they recognize the struggles that installers face.  We seek to create products that do not require special or expensive installation tools and to develop our products as kits so that they are straightforward enough for a DIY homeowner to use. Our new line of Quick-Connect® cable fittings makes it faster and easier to install cable assemblies in the field.  And we constantly review our product information and installation instructions, to make sure they are as complete and simple to use as possible.

The bottom line:  If you want the highest quality architectural solutions supported by a friendly and easy process, you’ve come to the right place.
