Stop Endlessly Spraying For Flies
	


Fly Predators are the natural enemy of flies, but never bother people or animals. Without resorting to chemicals, you’ll kill flies before they emerge. That way they never get a chance to bother you or your animals or reproduce by the gazillions.
You simply sprinkle Fly Predators near all manure areas every three to four weeks during warm months. It just takes a few minutes and you’ve done your fly control for the month. It’s as simple as opening a sack of potato chips!
Preventing flies is key,  If you just go after adult flies buzzing around but that’s only about 15% of the population at any time. If you don’t stop the future ones you’ll be plagued all summer.
