Di Monspace kita tak menjanjikan bulan dan bintang tetapi saham IPO ini berada di taraf bursa Nasdaq(pelancaran hujung tahun 2017).Pendapatan dari modal minima tadi dalam tempoh 3 tahun akan datang Insyallah boleh mencecah 1 Juta ringgit Malaysia. kita tunjukkan pengiraan secara kasar saja.., modal minima 560 bersamaan 500 unit dan melalui istem split iaitu unit menjadi berganda x2 sebanyak 5 kali dalam  masa setahun... :- 500...1000...2000...4000..16000...(5x) =16000 x 10usd(rate minima di nasdaq) x 4.5(pertukaran ringgit) =RM720,000(dalam tahun pertama) :-katakan dah masuk tahun ke-3  =16000 x 15usd(rate dah meningkat) x 4.5(kadar masih sama) =RM1,080,000 Jadi apa yg kita nampak disini adalah satu peluang besar..Marilah kita sama2 manfaatkan saham IPO ini walaupun pada hakikatnya ianya kecil tetapi pengaruhnya sgt besar.Jadi kepada sesiapa yg nak tahu lbh lanjut boleh menghubungi di talian 0129155645. **untuk makluman panggilan kami sentiasa sibuk akhir2 ini dan jika panggilan tidak berjawab boleh hantarkan saja butir peribadi anda seperti "nama & kawasan" cth: Ali seremban ke aplikasi whatsapp 0129155645 dan kami akan menghubungi anda semula. #sahamIPOmonspace 展开更多

Mon Space Net Inc. Amends Articles of Incorporation
Feb 6 17
On January 13, 2017, the majority shareholder of Mon Space Net Inc. approved the increase of its authorized shares of common stock from 500,000,000 to 1,000,000,000, par value $0.001 per share. On the same day, the board of directors of the company adopted the resolution to amend its articles of incorporation to affect the increase of authorized stock.
What is Business-to-Consumer (B2C)?
Business-to-consumer – “B2C” – refers to commerce between a business and an individual consumer.
While it applies to any type of direct-to-consumer selling, it has come to be associated with online selling, also known as ecommerce or etailing. Ecommerce took off significantly in the late 1990s, with the 1998 holiday shopping season identified as the first “e-tail Christmas.” That year, Amazon surpassed more than $1 billion in sales for the first time.
In recent years, the growth in business-to-consumer online sales has created significant challenges for traditional “brick-and-mortar” businesses and services that are losing in-person sales to online competitors.
As a result, many brick-and-mortar businesses are establishing their own online presence to stay competitive. This has created opportunities for consumers, who can now enjoy the convenience of online ordering while saving on shipping expenses with certain retailers by picking up or returning orders to the online retailer’s brick-and-mortar stores.
Business-to-Consumer Sales Models
In online business-to-consumer sales, there are generally five business models.
1. Direct Sellers
This is the type most people are familiar with – they are the online retail sites where consumers buy products. They can be manufacturers such as Gap or Dell or small businesses that create and sell products, but they can also be online versions of department stores selling products from a wide range of brands and manufacturers. Examples include Target.com, Macys.com, and Zappos.com.
2. Online Intermediaries
These “go-betweens” put buyers and sellers together without owning the product or service. Examples include online travel sites such as Expedia and Trivago and arts and crafts retailer Etsy.
3. Advertising-Based
This approach leverages high volumes of web traffic to sell advertising which, in turn, sells products or services to the consumer. This model uses high-quality free content to attract site visitors, who then encounter online ads. Media outlets that have no paid subscription component, such as the Huffington Post and Observer.com, are examples.
4. Community-Based
This model uses online communities built around shared interests to help advertisers market their products directly to site users. It could be an online forum for photography buffs, people with diabetes, or marching band members. The best-known example is Facebook, which helps marketers target ads to people according to very specific demographics.
5. Fee-Based
These direct-to-consumer sites charge a subscription fee for access to their content. They typically include publications that offer a limited amount of content for free but charge for most of it – such as The Wall Street Journal – or entertainment services such as Netflix or Hulu.
Businesses selling directly to consumers should take into account how their target customers like to shop and buy products like theirs as they explore various business-to-consumer options, whether those possibilities involve in-person or online transactions.

	offer an online marketplace to sell products and services using a business to business to consumer model. The Company’s
	operations to date have been limited to offering shares of Common Stock to investors.




	 




	On
	March 28, 2017, the Company incorporated MSNI (M) Sdn. Bhd., a company formed under the laws of Malaysia, as a wholly owned subsidiary.




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America (“GAAP”) in all material respects.




	 





	Principles
	of Consolidation





	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MSNI (M) Sdn. Bhd. Intercompany
	transactions and balances have been eliminated.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates and Assumptions





	 




	The
	preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions. Balances held by the Company are not typically
	in excess of FDIC insured limits. At March 31, 2017, all of the Company’s cash was deposited in one bank.




	 





	Loss
	Per Common Share





	 




	Loss
	per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
	during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts
	to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
	in the net income of the entity. As of March 31, 2017, there are no outstanding dilutive securities.




	 





	Foreign
	Currency





	 




	The
	Company has determined that the functional currency of the Company is U.S. Dollars. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses
	are included in the statement of operations as other income (expense).




	 





	Subsequent
	Events





	 




	The
	Company has evaluated all transactions through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration.

	NOTE
	2 – GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	Company has not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has operating losses of $14,176 for the three months ended March
	31, 2017. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to execute its operation plan to generate
	sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other
	sources, as may be required. There can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will
	be available on terms acceptable to our company. We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, our available cash will
	not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations, without further financing, for up
	to 12 months.




	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern;
	however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements
	do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the
	amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




	 




	We
	are attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however, our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations.
	While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional
	funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
	our ability to further implement our business plan, generate sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses and in our ability
	to raise additional funds.




	 





	NOTE
	3 – EQUITY





	 




	The
	Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock.




	 




	During
	the March 2017, the Company recorded $2,625 in additional paid in capital for filing expenses paid on behalf of the Company from
	one of its directors, Low Koon Poh.




	 





	NOTE
	4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION








	 


	During January 2017, the Company paid
	certain general and administrative expenses on behalf of Mon Space Plantation Inc, a company whose directors include Lai Chai
	Suang, Low Koon Poh and Chan Foo Weng, who are also directors of Mon Space Net Inc. in the amount of $5,000. The amounts are recorded
	as a receivable on the accompanying balance sheet.


	 






	NOTE
	5 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	 




	On
	April 7, 2017, the wholly-owned subsidiary, MSNI (M) Sdn Bhd entered into a collaboration agreement with Monspacemall Sdn Bhd.,
	a company formed under the laws of Malaysia to conduct its business jointly under the name of “monspacemall.com”.
	Monspacemall Sdn Bhd is partially owned by the CEO of the Company. The Company will be entitled to 50% of the profits of the venture.




	 




	On
	April 7, 2017, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement with the shareholders of Monspacemall Sdn Bhd pursuant to which
	the Company agreed to purchase a 100% equity interest, or 100,000 ordinary shares of Monspacemall Sdn Bhd for an aggregate purchase
	of $50,000. The consummation of the acquisition is subject to the completion of an audit of Monspacemall Sdn Bhd.

	Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations







	 





	Overview





	 




	We
	were incorporated on December 31, 2015 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Mon Space Net, Inc. (“Mon Space”) plans
	to build an online marketplace that will be created to sell products and services to its members using a business to business
	to consumer model (B2B2C). With respect to our business, we plan to build an online platform that allows the users to be
	“merchants” as well as “shoppers” at the same time. Through the features, products and services offered
	in our platform, the platform is expected to create interaction among the users and encourage them to promote and advertise their
	products on our platform. In the meantime, the users could purchase products and services from other users who sell such products
	and services at a discounted price. Our platform is also designed and built to encourage users to return and refer new users.
	It is the Company’s objective to develop a large base of users so that the merchant users on our platform can offer their
	products and services at a discount that is not available through any other channels, and so that our shopper users will choose
	our platform as their primary destination for purchasing products and services. Despite of our plan, we currently have no commitments
	for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal.




	  




	In
	February 2016, we completed a Regulation S offering in which we sold 208,330,000 shares of Common Stock to thirty-seven (37) investors,
	at a purchase price of $0.001 per share for aggregate offering proceeds of $208,330. 





	 






	Plan
	of Operations





	 




	Our
	goal is to maintain the quality of our product and to obtain the resources sufficient to obtain new members and merchandisers


	.




	 




	In
	April 2017, we acquired the company Monspacemall Sdn Bhd (“MSB”), which owned and operated an e-commerce platform
	called “monspacemall.com”. MSB was incorporated less than one year but the e-commerce platform started commercialisation
	in Q3 2016. We shall inject more database of consumers into this platform to build the user base.




	 




	In
	the next three months thereafter, we plan to expand our merchants and product base and increase membership through aggressive
	referral campaigns by the then-existing members. We also plan to set up warehouse and logistic systems for orders, distribution
	and packaging, as well as to hire necessary warehouse and logistic staff.




	 




	During
	the third quarter, it is our goal to create our own brand merchandises for items such as apparel, gift products and other promotional
	items. We plan to achieve this by hiring internal design staff for our own products.




	 




	By
	the end of the next fiscal year, it is our goal to set up offices in countries such as China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand
	for sourcing more merchants. We also plan to engage in marketing activities in various local markets to bring in more awareness
	of our online platform. Our goal is to obtain as many members as possible so that we can use our members’ collective bargaining
	power to negotiate the lowest price with the merchants for their products. 




	 




	If
	we are unable to build a sustainable customer base through our marketing channels, we will cease our development and/or marketing
	operations until we raise money. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult.
	As such, if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment.
	We intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the OTCQB, for which there is no
	assurance. If we need additional cash but are unable to raise it, we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise
	the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.




	 





	Results
	of Operations





	 




	We
	generated no revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, and the following summarizes our operating
	expenses, and net loss for all periods presented below. The Company’s operations to date have been limited to offering shares
	of Common Stock to investors.

	Three
	Months Ended March 31, 2017 compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2016





	 






	General
	and administrative:

	 

	The consolidated general and administrative expenses increased $1,640, or 13%, to $14,157 for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $12,517 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was attributable to
	the inclusion of the subsidiary-incurred secretarial, printing and stationery fees as well as increase in filing fees.




	 






	Other
	expenses:

	 

	The consolidated other expenses increased $19, or 100%, to $19 for the three months ended March 31, 2017
	from $nil for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was attributable to foreign currency transactions carried out
	by the wholly owned subsidiary, MSNI (M) Sdn. Bhd.




	 






	Net
	loss:


	Net loss increased by $1,659, or 13%, to $14,176 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $12,517 for the
	three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net loss was driven by an increase of $1,640 in total general and administrative
	expenses and an increase of $19 in other expenses.




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	As
	of March 31, 2017, we had a cash balance of $46,249. During the first three months ended March 31, 2017, we had no cash inflows,
	and operations used $19,448 in cash. We can provide no assurance that we can continue to satisfy our cash requirements for at
	least the next twelve months.




	 




	We
	have nominal assets and have generated no revenues since inception. We currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures.
	We may be required to raise additional funds, particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our
	operations. We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our
	cash requirements under our present operating expectations, without further financing, for up to 12 months. In addition, our company
	may, from time to time, receive continued funding and capital resources from related parties. However, as of the date of this
	Form 10, such related parties do not have any existing obligation to advance funds or working capital to support our business,
	nor can our company rely on any advance funds from such related parties. Other than working capital, we presently have no other
	alternative source of working capital. We may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and
	to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations. We may need to raise significant additional capital
	to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We do not anticipate we will be profitable in 2017.
	Therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. Financing transactions may include
	the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, a downturn in
	the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities.
	Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect
	amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore,
	if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities
	may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional
	capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable
	to obtain additional financing, we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our
	operations.




	 











	 



	8



	 







	 









	 




	We
	anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future.
	Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.




	 




	Our
	liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs
	associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
	and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations
	to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	We
	have not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has operating losses of $14,176 for the three months ended March 31,
	2017. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to execute our operating plan to generate sufficient cash
	flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources, as
	may be required. There can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available
	on terms acceptable to our company. We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, our available cash will not be sufficient
	to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations, without further financing, for up to 12 months.




	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern; however,
	the above conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not include
	any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
	of liabilities that may result should the we were unable to continue as a going concern.




	 




	We
	are attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however, our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations.
	While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional
	funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of us to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability
	to further implement our business plan, generate sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses and in our ability to raise additional
	funds




	 





	Significant
	and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices





	 




	While
	our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that
	the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion
	and analysis.




	 





	Principles
	of Consolidation





	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MSNI (M) Sdn. Bhd. Intercompany
	transactions and balances have been eliminated




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions. Balances held by the Company are not typically
	in excess of FDIC insured limits. At March 31, 2017, all of the Company’s cash was deposited in one bank.




	 





	Foreign
	Currency





	 




	The
	Company has determined that the functional currency of the Company is U.S. Dollars. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses
	are included in the statement of operations as other income (expense).

	Use
	of Estimates and Assumptions





	 




	The
	preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	From
	time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting
	bodies that are adopted by our company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that recently
	issued accounting pronouncements adopted do not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.




	 





	Contractual
	Obligations





	 




	We
	do not have any contractual obligations at this time.





	 






	Off
	Balance Sheet Arrangement





	 




	We
	do not have any off-balance sheet arrangement.

	Controls
	and Procedures.







	 





	Disclosure
	controls and procedures





	 




	Pursuant
	to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), the Company carried out an evaluation,
	with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)
	and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (the Company’s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness
	of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end
	of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s
	disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of March 31, 2017 to ensure that information required to be disclosed
	by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
	reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
	to the Company’s management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
	required disclosure for the reason described below.




	 




	Because
	of our limited operations, we have limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. In addition, we lack a
	formal audit committee with a financial expert. As we grow and expand our operations we will engage additional employees and experts
	as needed. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will expand.




	   





	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 




	There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have
	materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	(a)


	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and




	 


	 


	 




	 


	(b)


	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.

	CAUTIONARY
	NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS





	  




	This
	Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements”. Forward-looking statements discuss matters that
	are not historical facts. Because they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking statements may include words such
	as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “could,” “should,”
	“would,” “may,” “seek,” “plan,” “might,” “will,” “expect,”
	“anticipate,” “predict,” “project,” “forecast,” “potential,” “continue”
	negatives thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, are based on various
	underlying assumptions and current expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve known and unknown
	risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievement to be
	materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.




	 




	We
	cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that
	the results or conditions described in such statements or that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume
	any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
	are found at various places throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include information concerning possible or assumed
	future results of our operations, including statements about potential acquisition or merger targets; business strategies; future
	cash flows; financing plans; plans and objectives of management; any other statements regarding future acquisitions, future cash
	needs, future operations, business plans and future financial results, and any other statements that are not historical facts.




	 




	These
	forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are
	subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results
	to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties
	and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or
	at a different time than we have described. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
	which speak only as of the date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements
	concerning other matters addressed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf
	are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Annual Report on Form
	10-K.




	 




	Except
	to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result
	of new information, future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or
	otherwise.

	Overview





	 




	Mon
	Space Net, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on December 31, 2015 under the laws of the State of Nevada,

	Mon
	Space Net Inc. (“Mon Space”) plans to build an online marketplace that will be created to sell products and services
	to its members using a business to business to consumer model (B2B2C). 

	With respect to our business, we plan to build
	an online platform that allows the users to be “merchants” as well as “shopper” at the same time. Through
	the features, products and services offered in our platform, the platform is expected to create interaction among the users and
	encourage them to promote and advertise their products on our platform. In the meantime, the users could purchase products and
	services from other users who sell such products and services at a discounted price. Our platform is also designed and built to
	encourage users to return and refer new users. It is Company’s objective to develop a large base of users so that the merchant
	users on our platform could offer their products and services at a discount that is not available through any other channels and
	our shopper users will choose our platform as their primary destination for purchasing products and services. Despite of our plan,
	we currently have no commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal. 



	 



	In
	February 2016, we completed a Regulation S offering in which we sold 208,330,000 shares of Common Stock to thirty-seven (37) investors,
	at a purchase price of $0.001 per share for an aggregate offering price of $208,330. 



	 




	Implications
	of Being an Emerging Growth Company





	 




	We
	qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified
	reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:





	 









	●




	A
	requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years
	of related MD&A; 





	 


	 


	 







	●




	Exemption
	from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s
	internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
	of 2002; 





	 


	 


	 







	●




	Reduced
	disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements;
	and	 





	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	No
	non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.





	 




	We
	have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus, which are also available to us as a smaller
	reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).




	 




	In
	addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
	period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying
	with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore our
	financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.




	 




	We
	could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year
	in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as
	defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates
	exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which
	we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

	Our
	Business





	 






	Online
	Platform






	 




	We
	plan to launch “Mon Space Mall”, an online platform that would allow third-party merchants, as well as individual
	users, to sell their general merchandise products and services directly to other users on our platform. We plan to charge the
	sellers a service fee of approximately 3% of the total purchase price with respect to their general merchandise sold through our
	website. We also plan to generate revenue through from third-party merchants if they advertise products through our website. Third-party
	merchants use our website to advertise and sell their goods, manage customer data, and track orders and shipments. Consumers shop
	online and pay for products and services through the system. Thus, we do not buy, hold, or sell any inventory. In addition, as
	we begin to accumulate a large base of membership for our website, we plan to negotiate with merchandisers and source quality
	products at a discount not available anywhere else for our users.




	 




	Any
	user could register to become a member for an annual fee, which will provide our members with exclusive discounts and benefits.
	We expect our website to provide retail, as well as a potential wholesale, channel to manufacturers and distributors who wish
	to sell directly to consumers. Our platform will eliminate most intermediate links and results in substantial channel cost savings.
	By providing direct access to our members, merchants attain an immediate and dramatic expansion of their retail exposure throughout
	the world. Merchants benefit from the online nature of business-to-consumer e-commerce transactions that facilitate fast and immediate
	receipt of orders, shorten accounts receivable periods, enhance cash flow, reduce cost of sales, and increase a seller’s
	operational capacity. 




	 




	While
	our website is still under construction, we plan to provide consumer goods and services in the following major categories:




	 




	1.      Clothing
	and shoes;




	2.      Nutrition
	and health supplements;




	3.      Cosmetics
	and beauty;




	4.      Jewelry
	and accessories;




	5.      Office
	supplies;




	6.      Household
	items;




	7.      Luxury
	products;




	8.      Kitchen
	appliances




	9.      Cultural
	decorations;




	10.    Toys
	and games;




	11.    Consumer
	electronics;




	12.    Home
	furnishings




	 





	Recent
	Development





	 




	On
	March 28, 2017, we incorporated MSNI (M) Sdn. Bhd., a company formed under the laws of Malaysia (“MSNI Malaysia”).
	As a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company, MSNI Malaysia entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”)
	with Monspacemall Sdn Bhd, a company formed under the laws of Malaysia (“Monspacemall”) on April 7, 2017. Pursuant
	to the Collaboration Agreement, MSNI Malaysia agreed to conduct its business jointly with Monspacemall under the name of “monspacemall.com”.
	As part of the collaboration, MSNI Malaysia has agreed to contribute to the business an initial consumer database of up to 500,000
	members, whereas Monspacemall has agreed to provide services in connection with the management and operation of the e-commerce
	engine with domain name “monspacemall.com”. In consideration of its respective contribution to the collaboration,
	MSNI Malaysia and Monspacemall will each receive 50% of the profit generated from monspacemall.com.




	 




	On
	April 7, 2017, we entered into an acquisition agreement with the shareholders of Monspacemall pursuant to which we agreed to purchase
	100% equity interest, or 100,000 ordinary shares of Monspacemall for an aggregate purchase price of US$50,000. The consummation
	of the acquisition is subject to the completion of the audit for Monspacemall.

	Competition





	 




	We
	compete against both domestic and international e-commerce businesses as well as traditional retailers that are expanding into
	e-commerce. We believe our major competitors include, among others, Amazon, EBay, and Alibaba.




	 




	We
	believe our e-commerce business model possesses a number of strategically significant strengths. For example, our platform will
	contain business-to-consumer e-commerce with full range of consumer goods and services, from clothing and consumer electronics
	to household appliances and home furnishings. For sellers, the platform provides comprehensive retail channel benefits and geographical
	breadth while permitting autonomy and flexibility in how sellers fulfill and ship goods to consumers. By concentrating on e-commerce
	technology, we help sellers avoid the overhead and operational difficulties of logistics and supply chains.




	 




	Our
	website is presently disadvantaged by its limited history in the marketplace and our need to recruit and train experienced personnel.
	In addition to the competition we face from other e-commerce businesses, we require time and resources to further integrate our
	banking, merchant, and consumer partners.




	 





	Marketing
	Strategy






	 





	Our
	marketing efforts are comprised primarily of online social media and word of mouth advertising geared toward building brand recognition
	and brand differentiation.  We also plan to provide existing members with referral bonus for each new member that they sign
	up. In addition, we plan to incentivize existing members to refer new members by rewarding additional bonus for each sale or purchase
	that the new member makes. Once we establish a large base of membership, we believe we will have sufficient bargaining strength
	to negotiate with merchandisers to provide deep discounts on our platform to attract more members. We aim to build ourselves to
	be a leader in the E-commerce market, and attempt to reinforce on a consistent basis that it should be a destination of choice
	for merchandisers and consumers worldwide.




	 





	Government
	Regulation





	 




	In
	connection with the operation of our business, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including
	those related to:




	 





	 


	●



	nutritional
	content labeling and disclosure requirements;





	 


	 


	 




	 


	●



	management
	and protection of the personal data of our employees and customers;





	 


	 


	 




	 


	●

	  




	sales
	tax; and





	 


	 


	 




	 


	●



	various
	federal, state and local laws relating to, among other things, business, health, food safety codes.








	 




	These
	laws and regulations are complex, which complicates monitoring and compliance. As a result, regulatory risks are inherent in our
	operations. We may experience material difficulties or failures with respect to compliance with these laws and regulations in
	the future. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in litigation, fines, penalties, judgments or other
	sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, operations and reputation.  




	 





	Employees





	 




	We
	presently have no employees apart from our officers and directors.





	 






	Seasonality





	 




	We
	do not have a seasonal business cycle.





	 






	Environmental
	Matters





	 




	Our
	business currently does not implicate any environmental regulation.




	 





	Intellectual
	Property





	 




	We
	do not hold any patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property on products relating to our business. However, in
	addition to our domain name, from time to time, we may apply for patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property
	essential to the protection of our brand and success of our business.




	 





	Domain
	Names





	 




	As
	of the date of this annual report, we plan to register a domain that would be suitable for our business and easy for our potential
	members to remember.

	Item 1A.






	Risk Factors







	 





	Risks
	Related to Our Business





	 





	LIMITED
	OPERATING HISTORY





	 




	Mon
	Space was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 31, 2015. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have had
	limited operations upon which an evaluation of our company and its prospects could be based. There can be no assurance that our
	management will be successful in completing the our business development plans, implementing the corporate infrastructure to support
	operations at the levels called for by our business plan, devise a marketing plan to successfully reach customers who will purchase
	the various baked good products and services marketed by our company or that our company will generate sufficient revenues to
	meet our expenses or to achieve or maintain profitability.




	 





	SUBSTANTIAL
	DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN

	 




	 




	We had no revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and now operating losses for the reporting period then ended.
	These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 




	 




	We
	are attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however, our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations.
	While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds,
	there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s
	ability to further implement its business plan, generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds.




	 





	FAILURE
	TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR VENDORS





	 




	Maintaining
	good relationships with suppliers of products and services that are offered through our website that compete with each other can
	be difficult.  For example, suppliers of similar products may compete for desirable virtual shelf space or priority
	exposure of their products on our website to our customer base.  There can be no assurance that our current vendors
	will continue to offer their products and services through our website, or that we will be able to establish new or extend current
	vendor relationships to ensure a steady supply to our members in a timely and cost-efficient manner.  If we are unable
	to develop and maintain good relationships with these manufacturers and distributors, it may inhibit our ability to offer products
	and services demanded by our customers, or to offer them in sufficient quantities and at prices acceptable to them. In
	addition, if our vendors cease to provide us with favorable pricing or payment terms or return policies, our working capital requirements
	may increase and our operations may be materially and adversely affected. Any breakdown in our relationships with the
	manufacturers and distributors, or a failure to timely resolve disputes with or complaints from our vendors, could materially
	and adversely affect our business, prospects, and results of operations.




	 





	COUNTERFEIT
	PRODUCTS SOLD AT OUR WEBSITE.






	 





	We
	anticipate to offer goods and products from all over the world. Those manufacturers and distributors are separately
	responsible for sourcing the products they sell on our website. Although we plan to adopt necessary measures to verify
	the authenticity of products sold on our website and minimize potential infringement of third-party intellectual property rights
	in the course of sourcing and selling products, we may not always be successful.  In the event that counterfeit or infringing
	products are sold on our website, we could face claims that we should be held liable for selling counterfeit products or infringing
	on others’ intellectual property rights. If there is a successful claim against us, we might be required to pay
	substantial damages or refrain from further sale of the relevant products.  Moreover, regardless of whether we successfully
	defend against such claims, our reputation could be severely damaged. Successful claims of infringement of third-party intellectual
	property rights against us is a violation by the sellers of products and services on our website of agreements we have with such
	sellers, which automatically terminates such agreement, and any damages obtained against us may be deducted from sales by such
	sellers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial
	condition. 




	 





	FAILURE
	TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS





	 




	In
	connection with the operation of our business, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including
	those related to:




	 





	 



	●




	nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements;





	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	management

	and
	protection of the personal data of our employees and customers;





	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	sales tax;
	and




	 


	 


	 






	●



	various
	federal, state and local laws relating to, among other things, business, health, food
	safety codes.






	 




	These
	laws and regulations are complex, which complicates monitoring and compliance. As a result, regulatory risks are inherent in our
	operations. We may experience material difficulties or failures with respect to compliance with these laws and regulations in
	the future. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in litigation, fines, penalties, judgments or other
	sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, operations and reputation.

	SIGNIFICANT
	ADVERSE IMPACT TO OUR CAPITAL RESERVE OF ANY LIABLE UNINSURED CLAIM





	 




	We
	may not have sufficient insurance to cover potential risks and liabilities, including, but not limited to, injuries or economic
	losses arising out of or relating to our omission or errors in providing our services. Even if we decide to obtain additional
	insurance coverage in the future, it is possible that: (1) we may not be able to get enough insurance to meet our needs; (2) we
	may have to pay very high premiums for the additional coverage; (3) we may not be able to acquire any insurance for certain types
	of business risk; or (4) we may have gaps in coverage for certain risks. We may be exposed to potential uninsured claims for which
	we could have to expend significant amounts of capital. Consequently, if we were found liable for a significant uninsured claim
	in the future, we may be forced to expend a significant amount of our capital to resolve the uninsured claim.




	 





	OUR
	ABILITY TO ADAPT TO CONSTANTLY CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES





	 




	The e-commerce and
	retail industries are subject to changing consumer preferences.  Consequently, we must stay abreast of emerging lifestyle
	and consumer trends and anticipate trends that will appeal to existing and potential customers.  If our members cannot
	find their desired products on our website, they may stop purchasing products and services on our website, stop visiting our website,
	or visit less often.  If we do not anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to consumer preferences or changes
	in consumer trends at an early stage, we may not be able to generate our desired level of sales.  Such circumstances
	could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.




	 





	INTERRUPTION
	IN THE FUNCTIONING OF OUR NETWORK OR SERVICES





	 




	We
	conduct all of our transactions through our website, and the proper functioning of our website is essential to our business. Our
	website is subject to unanticipated interruptions through failures of our software or network or virus attacks. The
	satisfactory performance, reliability, and availability of our website, our transaction-processing systems, and our network infrastructure
	are critical to our success and our ability to attract and retain customers. Any system interruptions caused by telecommunications
	failures, computer viruses, hacking or other attempts to harm our systems that result in the unavailability or slowdown of our
	website or reduced order fulfillment performance would reduce the volume of products and services sold and the attractiveness
	of offerings at our website.  Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins,
	and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of data, or the inability to accept and fulfill customer
	orders. We may also experience interruptions caused by reasons beyond our control. There can be no assurance
	that such unexpected interruptions will not happen and occurrences could damage our reputation and result in a material decrease
	in our revenues.




	 





	DEPENDENCE
	ON KEY PERSONNEL





	 




	The
	Company will be dependent on its key executives for the foreseeable future. The loss of the services from our officers could have
	a material adverse effect on the operations and prospects of the Company. Our officers are expected to handle all marketing and
	sales efforts and manage the operations in the early stage. Their responsibilities include developing and maintaining the customer
	base for our website, launching our website, and formulating marketing materials to be used as part of ongoing marketing efforts
	designed to build customer demand for the Company’s products and services. Another seasoned business manager with an interest
	and skills in the E-commerce industry would be needed to run the Company if the current officers are no longer available. At this
	time, the Company does not have an employment agreement with Mr. Low or Mr. Chan, though the Company may enter into such an agreement
	with them on terms and conditions usual and customary for its industry. The Company does not currently have “key man”
	life insurance on the officers.





	 






	INTENSE
	COMPETITION





	 




	We
	expect the online retail environment to be intensely competitive, and we face competition from established global or regional
	e-commerce businesses as well as traditional retailers that are expanding into e-commerce.




	 




	We
	compete with our competitors primarily on technological advancements, price and quality of products and services, volume of traffic
	and users, quality of website and content, strategic relationships, quality of services, effectiveness of sales and marketing
	efforts, talented staff, and pricing. We believe our particular disadvantages are that our website has had limited time in the
	marketplace and we must recruit and train experienced personnel. Over time, our competitors may gradually build certain competitive
	advantages over us in terms of greater brand recognition among internet users, better products and services, larger customer and
	vendor bases, more extensive and well-developed marketing and sales networks, and substantially greater financial and technical
	resources.




	 





	NEED
	FOR FINANCING





	 




	We largely depend on additional capital to implement our business plan and support our operations. Currently, we have no established
	bank-financing arrangements. Therefore, it is likely we will need to seek additional financing through future private offering
	of our equity securities, or through strategic partnerships and other arrangements with corporate partners. We have no current
	plans for additional financing in place. 




	 




	We
	cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the working capital as needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The sale
	of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our shareholders. The occurrence of indebtedness would result in increased
	debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.




	 




	If
	we are unable to raise capital as needed, we are required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could
	harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results, or cease our operations entirely, in which case, you will
	lose all your investment.




	 











	 



	5



	 







	 





	 





	ADVERSE
	EFFECT TO YOUR INTEREST UPON ADDITIONAL FINANCING





	 




	If
	we raise additional capital subsequent to this offering through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage
	ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution.
	In addition, we may also have to issue securities that may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our Common Stock.
	In the event we seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or its equivalents, this will result in increased
	interest expense.




	 





	INDEMNIFICATION
	AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY





	 




	Our
	Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws include provisions that eliminate the personal liability of the directors of the Company
	for monetary damages to the fullest extent possible under the laws of the State of Nevada or other applicable law. These provisions
	eliminate the liability of directors to the Company and its shareholders for monetary damages arising out of any violation of
	a director of her fiduciary duty of due care. Under Nevada law, however, such provisions do not eliminate the personal liability
	of a director for (i) breach of the director’s duty of loyalty, (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional
	misconduct or knowing violation of law, (iii) payment of dividends or repurchases of stock other than from lawfully available
	funds, or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived an improper benefit. These provisions do not affect a director’s
	liabilities under the federal securities laws or the recovery of damages by third parties. 




	 





	DISRUPTIONS
	IN THE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES





	 




	Disruptions
	in the United States national and global economies may result in high unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and
	spending. If such conditions occur, they may result in significant declines in the retail industry, which could directly affect
	the demand of our products. There can be no assurance that government responses to the disruptions will be able to restore investor
	confidence. Disruptions in the national and global economies therefore may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations,
	business and financial condition.




	 





	Risks
	Related to Our Common Stock





	 





	RESTRICTED
	SECURITIES; LIMITED TRANSFERABILITY





	 




	The
	securities should be considered a long-term, illiquid investment. Our securities have not been registered under the Securities
	Act, and cannot be sold without registration under the Securities Act or any exemption from registration. In addition, the securities
	are not registered under any state securities laws that would permit their transfer. Because of these restrictions and the absence
	of an active trading market for our securities, a shareholder will likely be unable to liquidate an investment even though other
	personal financial circumstances would dictate such liquidation.




	 





	NO
	TRADING MARKET





	 




	There
	is no established trading marketing for our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that one will ever develop. Market liquidity
	will depend on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness
	of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able
	to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. As a result holders of our securities
	may not find purchasers for our securities should they to sell securities held by them. Consequently, our securities should be
	purchased only by investors having no need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our securities for an indefinite
	period of time.




	 





	NOT
	LIKELY TO PAY DIVIDENDS





	 




	We
	currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not
	expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy as circumstances dictate.




	 





	MAY
	BE SUBJECT NOW AND IN THE FUTURE TO THE SEC’S “PENNY STOCK” RULES





	 




	We
	may be subject now and in the future to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules if our shares of Common Stock sell below
	$5.00 per share. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers
	to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature
	and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations
	for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson, and monthly account statements showing the market
	value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson
	compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given
	to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation.




	 




	In
	addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction; the broker dealer must make a special written determination
	that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction.
	The penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading activity for shares of our
	Common Stock. As long as our shares of Common Stock are subject to the penny stock rules, the holders of such shares of Common
	Stock may find it more difficult to sell their securities.

	COSTS
	TO COMPLY WITH U.S. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS





	 




	We
	may incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable
	corporate governance requirements, including but not limited to requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We expect all
	of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some
	activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult
	and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits
	and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult
	for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently
	evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount
	of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. In addition, we may not be able to absorb these costs of being a
	public company which will negatively affect our business operations.





	 






	MANAGEMENT’S
	LACK OF PUBLIC COMPANY EXPERIENCE





	 




	Our

	 

	management
	lacks public company experience, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those
	imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management has never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company. Such
	responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our management
	may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased
	legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements, including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial
	reporting. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply
	with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) which is necessary
	to maintain our public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations, our ability to continue as a U.S. public
	company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our company.




	 





	OUR
	STATUS AS AN “EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY” UNDER THE JOBS ACT OF 2012





	 




	We
	are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an “emerging
	growth company,” we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public
	companies but not to “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with
	the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
	executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
	advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We
	could be an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the
	first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated
	filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Common Stock that
	is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter,
	or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.




	 




	In
	addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended
	transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
	In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards
	would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore
	our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.




	 




	Because
	of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an “emerging growth company,” we may be less
	attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable
	to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our reports are not as transparent as other
	companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results
	of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

	project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty
	on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that
	could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.





	 





	Overview





	 








	We
	were incorporated on December 31, 2015 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Mon Space Net, Inc. (“Mon Space”) plans
	to build an online marketplace that will be created to sell products and services to its members using a business to business
	to consumer model (B2B2C). With respect to our business, we plan to build an online platform that allows the users to be
	“merchants” as well as “shoppers” at the same time. Through the features, products and services offered
	in our platform, the platform is expected to create interaction among the users and encourage them to promote and advertise their
	products on our platform. In the meantime, the users could purchase products and services from other users who sell such products
	and services at a discounted price. Our platform is also designed and built to encourage users to return and refer new users.
	It is the Company’s objective to develop a large base of users so that the merchant users on our platform can offer their
	products and services at a discount that is not available through any other channels, and so that our shopper users will choose
	our platform as their primary destination for purchasing products and services. Despite of our plan, we currently have no commitments
	for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal.



	  


	In February 2016, we completed a Regulation
	S offering in which we sold 208,330,000 shares of Common Stock to thirty-seven (37) investors, at a purchase price of $0.001 per
	share for aggregate offering proceeds of $208,330.

	Plan
	of Operations





	 




	Our
	goal is to maintain the quality of our product and to obtain the resources sufficient to obtain new members and merchandisers


	.




	 







	In April 2017, we acquired the company
	Monspacemall Sdn Bhd (“MSB”), which owned and operated an e-commerce platform called “monspacemall.com”.
	MSB was incorporated less than one year but the e-commerce platform started commercialisation in Q3 2016. We shall inject more
	database of consumers into this platform to build the user base.


	 


	In the next three months thereafter,
	we plan to expand our merchants and product base and increase membership through aggressive referral campaigns by the then-existing
	members. We also plan to set up warehouse and logistic systems for orders, distribution and packaging, as well as to hire necessary
	warehouse and logistic staff.


	 


	During the third quarter, it is our
	goal to create our own brand merchandises for items such as apparel, gift products and other promotional items. We plan to achieve
	this by hiring internal design staff for our own products.


	 


	By the end of the next fiscal year,
	it is our goal to set up offices in countries such as China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand for sourcing more merchants. We also
	plan to engage in marketing activities in various local markets to bring in more awareness of our online platform. Our goal is
	to obtain as many members as possible so that we can use our members’ collective bargaining power to negotiate the lowest
	price with the merchants for their products. 


	 



	If
	we are unable to build a sustainable customer base through our marketing channels, we will cease our development and/or marketing
	operations until we raise money. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult.
	As such, if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment.
	We intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the OTCQB, for which there is no
	assurance. If we need additional cash but are unable to raise it, we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise
	the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans. 




	 





	Recent
	Development





	 




	On
	March 28, 2017, we incorporated MSNI (M) Sdn. Bhd., a company formed under the laws of Malaysia (“MSNI Malaysia”).
	As a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company, MSNI Malaysia entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”)
	with Monspacemall Sdn Bhd, a company formed under the laws of Malaysia (“Monspacemall”) on April 7, 2017. Pursuant
	to the Collaboration Agreement, MSNI Malaysia agreed to conduct its business jointly with Monspacemall under the name of “monspacemall.com”.
	As part of the collaboration, MSNI Malaysia has agreed to contribute an initial consumer database of up to 500,000 members to
	the business, whereas Monspacemall has agreed to provide services in connection with the management and operation of the e-commerce
	engine with domain name “monspacemall.com”. In consideration of its respective contribution to the collaboration,
	MSNI Malaysia and Monspacemall will each receive 50% of the profit generated from monspacemall.com.



	 


	On April 7, 2017, we entered into an
	acquisition agreement with the shareholders of Monspacemall pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 100% equity interest, or 100,000
	ordinary shares of Monspacemall for an aggregate purchase of US$50,000. The consummation of the acquisition is subject to the
	completion of the audit for Monspacemall. (forward-looking statement not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language) 


	 












	Results
	of Operations






	 






	Fiscal
	Year ended December 31, 2016





	 







	We generated no revenue for the fiscal years ended
	December 31, 2016 and 2015. We incurred operating expenses of $173,724, which is solely attributable to general and administrative
	expenses, comparing to 5,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 The significant increase is primarily due to the significant
	increase of professional expenses incurred from the launch of our business. As a result, we had a net loss of $173,724.



	 




	Our
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
	of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability
	and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue
	as a going concern.





	 







	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources






	 






	As of December 31, 2016, we had a cash balance
	of $65,700. During 2016, we raised $208,330 from the sale of our common stock to fund our future operating expenses, pay our obligations,
	and grow our company. We can provide no assurance that we can continue to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next
	twelve months.


	 










	 



	9



	 







	 





	 




	We
	have nominal assets and have generated no revenues since inception. We currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures.
	We may be required to raise additional funds, particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our
	operations. We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our
	cash requirements under our present operating expectations, without further financing, for up to 12 months. In addition, our company
	may, from time to time, receive continued funding and capital resources from related parties. However, as of the date of this
	registration statement, such related parties do not have any existing obligation to advance funds or working capital to support
	our business, nor can our company rely on any advance funds from such related parties. Other than working capital, we presently
	have no other alternative source of working capital. We may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations
	and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations. We may need to raise significant additional
	capital to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We do not anticipate we will be profitable
	in 2016. Therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. Financing transactions
	may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, a
	downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or
	debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses,
	fail to collect amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.
	Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity
	securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to
	obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations.
	If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and
	possibly cease our operations. 




	 




	We
	anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future.
	Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.




	 




	Our
	liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs
	associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
	and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations
	to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly.





	 






	Going
	Concern




	 




	Our financial statements have been prepared
	on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
	business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts
	of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern. 


	 


	The Company has not yet generated any
	revenue since its inception and has operating losses of $173,724 for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. These factors
	raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability
	to continue to execute our operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance that the
	necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to our company.


	 


	We are attempting to generate sufficient
	revenue; however, our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations. While we believe in the viability of
	our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances
	to that effect. The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our
	business plan, generate sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses and in our ability to raise additional funds.



	 





	Significant
	and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices





	 






	While
	our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements, we believe that the following
	accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis. 




	 






	Use
	of Estimates and Assumptions






	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	From
	time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting
	bodies that are adopted by our company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that recently
	issued accounting pronouncements adopted do not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.





	 






	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	have no off-balance sheet arrangements.




	 





	Contractual
	Obligations





	 




	We
	do not have any contractual obligations at this time.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 




	To
	the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

	Mon Space Net Inc.




	Selangor,
	Malaysia





	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mon Space Net Inc. as of December 31 2016 and 2015, and the related statements
	of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the one day ended
	December 31, 2015. Mon Space Net Inc.’s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is
	to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.



	 



	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
	free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
	over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
	audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
	of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
	principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.



	 



	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mon
	Space Net Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December
	31, 2016 and for the one day ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America.



	 



	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Mon Space Net Inc. will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 2 to the financial statements, Mon Space Net Inc. has no established source of revenues and has suffered losses from operations
	that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters
	are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
	uncertainty.

	NOTES
	TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 





	NOTE
	1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	The
	Company





	 




	Mon
	Space Net, Inc (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 31, 2015. The Company plans to
	offer an online marketplace to sell products and services using a business to business to consumer model. The Company’s
	operations to date have been limited to offering shares of Common Stock to investors. 




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	financial statements and accompanying notes to financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) in all material respects.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates and Assumptions





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions. Balances held by the Company are not typically
	in excess of FDIC insured limits. At December 31, 2016, all of the Company’s cash was deposited in one bank. 




	 





	Stock-based
	Compensation





	 




	The
	Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based compensation award at the grant date by using Black-Scholes Option Pricing
	Model. The fair value determined represents the cost of the award and is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee
	is required to provide service in exchange for the award. As stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on awards ultimately
	expected to vest. Excess tax benefits, if any, are recognized as additional paid in capital.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	An
	asset and liability approach is used for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
	are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
	amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
	enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
	or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
	not be realized. As of December 31, 2016, there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating
	loss or carry forward prior to expiration. 





	 






	Earnings
	(Loss) Per Common Share





	 




	Basic
	earnings (loss) per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number
	of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share reflect the potential dilution that could
	occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
	issuance of common stock that then shared in the net income of the entity. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there are no outstanding
	dilutive securities. 






	 

















	 


	F-

	6



	 







	 






	 






	Foreign
	Currency





	 




	The
	Company has determined that the functional currency of the Company is U.S. Dollars. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses
	are included in the statement of operations as other income (expense).




	 





	Subsequent
	Events





	 




	The
	Company has evaluated all transactions through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration.




	 





	New
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	In
	April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
	2016-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation” (topic 718). The FASB issued this update to improve the accounting
	for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several
	aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b)
	classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The updated guidance
	is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
	adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.



	 



	In
	May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606

	).” The new guidance
	provides new criteria for recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect
	the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance requires
	expanded disclosures to provide greater insight into both revenue that has been recognized and revenue that is expected to be
	recognized in the future from existing contracts. Quantitative and qualitative information will be provided about the significant
	judgments and changes in those judgments that management made to determine the revenue that is recorded. This accounting standard
	update, as amended, will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods
	within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to
	each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. Early adoption
	is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal 2017. The Company is currently assessing the provisions of the guidance and has not determined
	the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its financial statements.




	 







	In August
	2014, the FASB issues ASU 2014-15,

	Disclosure of Uncertainties about and Entity’s Activities to Continue as a Going Concern.

	The new standard requires management to assess the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Disclosures are
	required if there is substantial doubt as to the company’s continuation as a going concern within one year after the issue
	date of financial statements. The standard provides guidance for making the assessment including consideration of management’s
	plans which may alleviate doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is effective
	for years beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on
	our consolidated financial statements.

	2 – GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	Company has not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has operating losses of $173,724 for theyear ended December
	31, 2016. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations
	to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources, as may be required. 




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the
	above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
	to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of
	liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




	 




	In order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require additional working capital from either cash flow
	from operations, debt financing or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company currently has no commitments from any third
	parties for financing. If the Company is unable to acquire additional financing, it will be required to significantly reduce its
	current level of operations or cease business.

	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	 




	Pursuant
	to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), the Company carried out an evaluation,
	with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the Company's principal executive
	officer and interim principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as
	defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,
	the Company's Chief Executive Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of
	December 31, 2016   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company
	files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
	the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including Chief
	Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	We
	maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
	filed under the

	Securities Exchange Act of 1934

	, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
	time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
	including our president and chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal
	financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



	 



	As of December 31, 2016, the end of our fiscal year covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
	and with the participation of our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our
	principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
	controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial
	officer and principle accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end
	of the period covered by this annual report due to the material weakness in our control environment and financial reporting process
	consisting of the following: 



	 



	1)
	lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors
	on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal control
	and procedures;




	 




	2)
	inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives;




	 




	3)
	ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes; and




	 




	4)
	lack of accounting personnel with adequate experience and training.




	 





	Management’s
	Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

	  




	 




	The
	management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for
	the Company. Our internal control system was designed to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management
	and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations,
	internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
	to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
	of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	 











	 



	12



	 







	 





	 




	Our
	management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. The
	framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “Internal Control
	– Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO –

	2013 framework

	). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
	was not effective, as of December 31, 2016. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal
	control over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that amounted to material weaknesses.




	 




	The
	matters involving internal control over financial reporting that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the
	standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a
	majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective
	oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties
	consistent with control objectives of having segregation of the initiation of transactions, the recording of transactions and
	the custody of assets; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.  The aforementioned
	material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the audit of
	our financial statements as of December 31, 2016. 




	 





	Management's
	Remediation Initiatives





	 




	In
	an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to
	initiate, the following series of measures:




	 




	We
	plan to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available
	to us. First, we plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives of having separate individuals
	perform (i) the initiation of transactions, (ii) the recording of transactions and (iii) the custody of assets. Second, we
	will create a senior position to focus on financial reporting and standardizing and documenting our accounting procedures with
	the goal of increasing the effectiveness of the internal controls in preventing and detecting misstatements of accounting information.
	Third, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee
	resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
	internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available
	to us.




	 




	Management
	believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee,
	will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. We did not implement
	the said remedial measures in 2016. We anticipate that these remedial measures will be implemented when our financial conditions
	permit.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Controls over financial reporting





	 




	No
	change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31,
	2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Suang, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in the amount of $201,476. An amount of $190,000 was subsequently
	repaid in October 2016, leaving the balance of $11,476 outstanding as at December 31, 2016. This loan is interest free and due
	on demand.


	 


	The Company paid travel allowances totaling $15,000 to two
	directors, Low Koon Poh and Chan Foo Weng, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and recorded payments as compensation
	expense.


	 


	During 2016, the Company paid incorporation
	expenses on behalf of Mon Space Plantation Inc, a company whose directors include Lai Chai Suang, Low Koon Poh and Chan Foo Weng,
	in the amount of $1,599.


	 





	Free
	Office Space






	 




	We
	currently use the office space provided by our Director, Low Koon Poh at no cost. Once our business grows and generates sufficient
	revenue, we will look for a more suitable office space in a separate corporate office. 




	 





	Transactions
	with Promoters





	 




	We
	did not expressly engage a promoter at the time of its formation. Due to Mr. Low and Mr. Chan’s initiative in founding and
	organizing the business of the Company, they may be deemed to be a promoter under the Securities Act Rule 405. 




	 





	Independence
	of the Board of Directors





	 




	For
	a director to be “independent” under these standards, the Board must affirmatively determine that the director has
	no material relationship with us, either directly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship
	with us. Applying corporate governance standards, and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Board of Directors
	has determined that none of our directors are independent. This does not constitute an independent board of directors.

Monspace memberi peluang kepada anda yang berminat untuk menambah pendapatan sampingan yang lumayan. Sila whatsapp atau sms ke nombor 0129874740 atau 0189575505 untuk keterangan lanjut.





PENGENALAN 


Mon Space (M) Sdn Bhd, sebuah syarikat Malaysia yang stabil, berbakat dan bertaraf antarabangsa. Bermula pada November 2014 syarikat ini mempamerkan kejayaan cemerlang pada tahun pertama. Justeru itu, ia meraih pencapaian yang unggul di seluruh Asia. Asia merupakan benua penting dalam perkembangan ekonomi dunia masa kini. Antara 6 industri penting diberi fokus untuk masa hadapan adalah Industri Kewangan, Perumahan, Komunikasi, E-Dagang, Media Sosial dan Pelancongan.
Industri Kewangan: Merupakan industri yang berkembang pesat di abad ini. Menyediakan pinjaman modal kewangan peringkat antarabangsa. ‘Bond’ dan juga perdagangan FOREX antara contoh betapa pentingnya industri ini di dalam bandar-bandar besar.
Projek Perumahan: Dengan perkembangan yang pesat dan pembukaan bandar-bandar baru secara menyeluruh serta peningkatan taraf pendapatan rakyat malaysia menyebabkan permintaan yang tinggi dalam industri perumahan. Ini menyebabkan syarikat membuat pelaburan yang tinggi untuk industri ini.
Industri Komunikasi: Kajian menunjukkan, penggunaan komunikasi mudah alih di Asia telah melebihi separuh dari penduduk dunia. Ianya akan bertambah di masa akan datang.
E-Dagang: Dalam tahun 2015 sahaja 30% transaksi runcit di dunia, dikesan melalui  e-dagang. Pengguna tertinggi adalah penduduk Asia.
Media Sosial: Masakini, media sosial dilihat telah mengubah corak kehidupan manusia di seluruh dunia samada dalam komunikasi harian hingga cara para usahawan mempromosikan produk mereka.
Industri Pelancongan: Minat para pelabur dalam industri ini semakin berkembang. Kajian menunjukkan seramai 79.1 juta pelancong melawat negara-negara Asia dalam setahun dan dijangka meningkat 61.9% setiap tahun.
Atas sebab-sebab di atas, Mon Space (M) Sdn Bhd merancang untuk membuat pelaburan besar dalam keenam-enam industri penting seperti yang tersebut di atas. Monspace juga memfokuskan untuk membuka sebuah syarikat telekomunikasi baru di Malaysia iaitu YS Mobile. Ini adalah langkah pertama yang mempunyai potensi dan masa depan yang cerah kepada kami. Fokus kedua kami adalah Industri Perumahan yang telahpun bermula pembinaan kondominium mewah di Negeri Sembilan.
Berikutnya adalah Industri Pelancongan. Sebagai contoh adalah projek pembinaan sebuah resort bertaraf dunia di atas laut di Pulau Melaka. Dalam masa yang sama kami mula melabur dalam industri perhotelan di seluruh dunia. Sebagai permulaan syarikat kami telah membeli sebuah hotel 4 bintang di Ha Long Bay, Vietnam. Kami juga menyediakan sebuah ‘CLUB HOUSE’ bagi ahli Monspace yang pertama di dunia.
Selain itu, syarikat telah melancarkan landasan e-dagang bagi memudahkan para peniaga dan ahli Mon Space membina empayar perniagaan masing-masing. Syarikta kami juga akan memperkenalkan media sosial yang baru yang dikenali sebagai YS Chat.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.  The following plan of operation provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.  Overview  We were incorporated on December 31, 2015 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Mon Space Net, Inc. ("Mon Space") plans to build an online marketplace that will be created to sell products and services to its members using a business to business to consumer model (B2B2C). With respect to our business, we plan to build an online platform that allows the users to be "merchants" as well as "shoppers" at the same time. Through the features, products and services offered in our platform, the platform is expected to create interaction among the users and encourage them to promote and advertise their products on our platform. In the meantime, the users could purchase products and services from other users who sell such products and services at a discounted price. Our platform is also designed and built to encourage users to return and refer new users. It is the Company's objective to develop a large base of users so that the merchant users on our platform can offer their products and services at a discount that is not available through any other channels, and so that our shopper users will choose our platform as their primary destination for purchasing products and services. Despite of our plan, we currently have no commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal.  In February 2016, we completed a Regulation S offering in which we sold 208,330,000 shares of Common Stock to thirty-seven (37) investors, at a purchase price of $0.001 per share for aggregate offering proceeds of $208,330.  Plan of Operations  Our goal is to maintain the quality of our product and to obtain the resources sufficient to obtain new members and merchandisers.  In April 2017, we acquired the company Monspacemall Sdn Bhd ("MSB"), which owned and operated an e-commerce platform called "monspacemall.com". MSB was incorporated less than one year but the e-commerce platform started commercialisation in Q3 2016. We shall inject more database of consumers into this platform to build the user base.  In the next three months thereafter, we plan to expand our merchants and product base and increase membership through aggressive referral campaigns by the then-existing members. We also plan to set up warehouse and logistic systems for orders, distribution and packaging, as well as to hire necessary warehouse and logistic staff.  During the third quarter, it is our goal to create our own brand merchandises for items such as apparel, gift products and other promotional items. We plan to achieve this by hiring internal design staff for our own products.  By the end of the next fiscal year, it is our goal to set up offices in countries such as China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand for sourcing more merchants. We also plan to engage in marketing activities in various local markets to bring in more awareness of our online platform. Our goal is to obtain as many members as possible so that we can use our members' collective bargaining power to negotiate the lowest price with the merchants for their products.  If we are unable to build a sustainable customer base through our marketing channels, we will cease our development and/or marketing operations until we raise money. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult. As such, if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment. We intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the OTCQB, for which there is no assurance. If we need additional cash but are unable to raise it, we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.  Recent Development  On March 28, 2017, we incorporated MSNI (M) Sdn. Bhd., a company formed under the laws of Malaysia ("MSNI Malaysia"). As a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company, MSNI Malaysia entered into a collaboration agreement (the "Collaboration Agreement") with Monspacemall Sdn Bhd, a company formed under the laws of Malaysia ("Monspacemall") on April 7, 2017. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, MSNI Malaysia agreed to conduct its business jointly with Monspacemall under the name of "monspacemall.com". As part of the collaboration, MSNI Malaysia has agreed to contribute an initial consumer database of up to 500,000 members to the business, whereas Monspacemall has agreed to provide services in connection with the management and operation of the e-commerce engine with domain name "monspacemall.com". In consideration of its respective contribution to the collaboration, MSNI Malaysia and Monspacemall will each receive 50% of the profit generated from monspacemall.com.  On April 7, 2017, we entered into an acquisition agreement with the shareholders of Monspacemall pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 100% equity interest, or 100,000 ordinary shares of Monspacemall for an aggregate purchase of US$50,000. The consummation of the acquisition is subject to the completion of the audit for Monspacemall. (forward-looking statement not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language)  Results of Operations  Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2016  We generated no revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We incurred operating expenses of $173,724, which is solely attributable to general and administrative expenses, comparing to 5,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 The significant increase is primarily due to the significant increase of professional expenses incurred from the launch of our business. As a result, we had a net loss of $173,724.  Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of December 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $65,700. During 2016, we raised $208,330 from the sale of our common stock to fund our future operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We can provide no assurance that we can continue to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.  We have nominal assets and have generated no revenues since inception. We currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures. We may be required to raise additional funds, particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our operations. We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations, without further financing, for up to 12 months. In addition, our company may, from time to time, receive continued funding and capital resources from related parties. However, as of the date of this registration statement, such related parties do not have any existing obligation to advance funds or working capital to support our business, nor can our company rely on any advance funds from such related parties. Other than working capital, we presently have no other alternative source of working capital. We may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations. We may need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We do not anticipate we will be profitable in 2016. Therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations.  We anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly.  Going Concern  Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern.  The Company has not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has operating losses of $173,724 for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to continue to execute our operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to our company.  We are attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however, our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan, generate sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses and in our ability to raise additional funds.  Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices  While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis.  Use of Estimates and Assumptions  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by our company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that recently issued accounting pronouncements adopted do not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Contractual Obligations  We do not have any contractual obligations at this time.
