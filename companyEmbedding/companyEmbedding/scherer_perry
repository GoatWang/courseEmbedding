This essay has been submitted by a student. This is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers.
Now companies are improving their production by adopting different strategies in which backward integration is one of them. Backward Integration is a type of vertical integration in which a company gets control over its suppliers to improve the efficiency and save the cost which improves its profit margins and make the firm more competitive. Backward integration occurs through acquiring input suppliers, establishing long-term contracts with existing suppliers or investing in new input production capacity through internal corporate growth.
The main advantages of backward integration regardless of the industry are decreased marketing expenses, the stability of operations, the certainty of supplies of materials, much control on the distribution of products, tighter quality control, the on time review of fabrication and allocation policies, more control over inventory, and additional profit margins or the ability to charge lower prices on final products. These advantages must be weighed against the disadvantages which normally are disparities among productive capacities at a range of stages of manufacturing, governmental pressure, lack in interest of specialty, the firmness of operations, the extension of the management team and lack of direct competitive influence on the costs of transitional products.
Background:
This report highlights the comparison of two companies from Pakistan Food Industry the ENGRO FOODS and NESTLE PAKISTAN, which are applying backward integration to enhance their production capability. In Pakistan these are the top most companies which are playing a vital role in the food industry through their dairy and beverage products.
Nestle is a subsidiary of Swiss origin company which headquarter is located in vevey, Switzerland. Nestle Pakistan started its operations in 1988 with the collaboration of Milk Pak Ltd in Pakistan which is further took over total control in 1992. In Pakistan, its head quarter is located in Lahore and the company currently operating four production facilities. Two of its factories are located in sheikhupura and Kabirwala while one in Islamabad and one in Karachi. It has also the biggest milk collection operation in Pakistan through which they collects milk from an estimated 190,000 farmers and from their dairy farms located in different areas of Pakistan. Nestle Pakistan is currently the leading food & beverage company of Pakistan.
While Engro food is another biggest and fastest growing company in Pakistan. In 2005 Engro Foods limited was established and it is 100% owned by Engro Corporation. Engro Foods limited began their operations in 2006 and within 5 years they make realization to their competitor by increasing their market share gradually. At the end of 2010 Engro Foods Limited took control in the market of Ultra High Temperature by launching new products including ice cream, juices, powder milk and flavoured milk which contain great potential to compete in future. The Company is also entering into global markets. Its first mission is that to administer a Halal food business in North America known as Al-Safa, which was recently acquired by Engro Corporation at a total cost of 6.3 mn dollars.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Recently a seminar "Current Status of Foods Industry in Pakistan: Threats and Challenges" was held at Lahore on September 07, 2012 in which different analysts of PCSIR and Federal Minister of Science and Technology addresses that food industry in Pakistan has become the second largest industry by participating with 17% share in GDP and in Pakistan it is now become most consuming industry because people spent 42% of their earnings in foods products. And at the end of the session some analysts point out weak point of the food industry that the in appropriate management of food products and the large harvest losses in vegetables, fruits and grain create a food shortage in market.
There are several sectors of food industry while some are given below which are related to the project report, we will mainly focus on these. These sectors are as follows:
Dairy
Juices
Ice creams
2.1 Dairy
Dairy sector is one of the most important sectors of Pakistan which affects more than 10 mn families. There are a lot of companies in Pakistan who are purchasing milk from farmers for their satisfaction. The dairy industry is providing packed milk to its consumers in the shape of UHT, Pasteurized, Tea Whitener and Flavored milk. The industry is also producing Ice Cream, Yoghurt, Cheese, Butter and miscellaneous food items for children's. 
Milk is the most consumable food item having a life of 4 hours under at a certain temperature level of room. Pakistan is 3rd leading milk producing country in the world with more than 47 billion litters' production and 11.30% contribution in GDP and a milk economy that in value terms is 27.7% of the total agriculture sector. According to analysts the milk production is expected to grow at 2% annually, however the processed industry is only 7% of operated milk. The milk, remaining wastages and farmer preservation is 20.7 bn liters of which 1.4 bn goes into processing and the rest is sold as a commodity in retail outlets and through door to door Gawala system. So, there is an immense prospect and +prospective to grow the processed milk business.
The processed milk has segmented into three categories namely:
Ambient UHT
Powder
2.1.1 Ambient UHT
As of 2010, Ambient UHT constitutes only 4% of the total Tradable Milk segment. Industry volumes have grown 10% from 2006-2010 and the market size was 790 million liters as of December 2010.
2.1.2 Powder
Currently, the size of the branded powder market is approximately 57,000 tons, which uses approximately 540 mn liters of milk and 3% of tradable milk. Powder market size has grown 17% from 2006 to 2010 and it is expected to grow 14% in the next five years due to economy that powder offers as well as its specialize use as growing up and infant nutrition source. Nestle Pakistan is the market leader in this segment.
2.2 Juices
The Juices, Nectars and Still drinks market are of 507 Million Liters which has total market value of PKR 31 Billion. This market is subdivided into Juice and Nectar and Value added Still Drinks. Juices contain 100% fruit substance, Nectar contain 25% to 99% fruit substance while still drinks contain 0 to 24 % fruit substance & value added still drinks have innovative packaging or addition of pulp etc. Nestle Pakistan is the market leader in this segment.
2.3 Ice Cream
The Ice Cream sector of Pakistan has growing constantly and registers a volume growth of 20% in 2010 as compare to 2009. The overall volume of ice cream sold in 2010 was 71 Million liters while the total market value was PKR 8.8 billion. The industry volumes have grown 11% over the last four years. However, it is expected that growth will be higher in next five years on the back of significant investment by the industry's key players. Walls are the market leader in this industry which is followed by Omore.

The main advantage of creating own farms is that both the companies get on time delivery of their material, which help them to enhance their production and deliver their product on time to the end consumers. The details of Engro Foods and Nestle Pakistan farms are given below:
4.1 Engro Foods Dairy Farm
Engro Food has selected the Nara Canal due to the presence of its outstanding water, farming land availability and suitable weather for its Dairy Farm. The company has launched a comprehensive vaccination programme with the provision of clean water and balanced nutrition to have infection free, strong and happy animals at all times. The Company's Nara Dairy Farm continued to remain a rich and nutritious source of raw material for its dairy section. The Nara Farm formed over 5.8 mn liters of milk in 2011 with a total herd size of over 3,000 animals. But in 2012, Dairy Farm produced 26,979 liters of milk per day. At March 31, 2012 Dairy Farm herd increased to 3,204 animals. Through it the profit after tax stood at Rs. 5 million versus loss of Rs. 19 million in March 2011, primarily due to higher yield and production.
4.2 Nestle Dairy Farms
Nestle Pakistan manages the project under its Agricultural Division. Over 75 professionals are currently associated with these services; intend to help in increasing the sustainability of the dairy segment in Pakistan. They give the farmers with free technical assistance and veterinary services to build the skills of the farmers in best farming practices and improved livestock management and link them to small businesses and to the dairy market.
For this purpose,Nestle has built two demonstrations and teaching farms, one of which is still under process. The main training facility is the Sarsabz Demonstration and Training Farm which is located on Multan Road, near Okara. The second training Sukeki Farm, is under in building process near Lahore. At the farm, there are more than 250 cows, animal huts, milking machinery, a teaching centre, and hostel for the farmers, management office and necessary farm equipment and highly qualified instructors who train farmers on high quality dairy farming and livestock management. Nestle Pakistan has established this training facility over 103 acres of leased land as an investment for the development of the dairy sector and to work towards sustainable farming and an improved rural economy.
 
5. LITERATURE REVIEW
The concept of vertical integration is very old and we saw a lot of academic and legal debates over the costs and benefits of vertical integration. McGee, Bassett and Williamson (1975, 1985, 1989) said that vertical integration is a mean of reducing transactions costs, assuring supply, reducing risk and alleviating the efficiency losses.
But on the other side, economists see vertical integration as a means for firms to reduce competition or extract market rents (Scherer, Perry 1978, 1989).Perry, Hart and Tirole (1978), said that most discussions have focused on the effects of forward integration into a competitive product market and little work exists on the effects of backward integration into a competitive input market. However, Knoeber and Thurman (1996) further said that backward integration is of growing importance in many agricultural and natural resource industries.
According to Azzam (1996), backward integration occurs through acquiring input suppliers, establishing long-term contracts with existing suppliers or investing in new input production capacity through internal company growth. In some businesses, there is growing concern about the effects of such integration on remaining un- integrated input suppliers. First he said that backward-integrated dominant firm benefits from production efficiency gains. Second he further adds that backward-integrated dominant firm may benefit from a lower acquisition price for externally supplied raw inputs.
As per Blois (1972), the biggest advantages of backward integration are to lower down transportation and marketing expense, production or operation stability, timely supplier services, high quality control, necessary revisions in production and execution policies, maintained inventory control, and high profit margin able produces to charge lower prices on finished products.
While Williamson (1971) do not consider supply dependability as a necessary advantage and point out the interests harmonization and efficient utilization in process of decision making as the core advantages of backward integration. As per Williamson (1971), backward integration allows management to easily harmonized interest as possible differences can be resigned.
As per Lambertini and Rossini (2008), backward vertical integration is indirectly proportional to producers and suppliers. As compare to forward vertical integration, backward vertical integration provides large incentives in investment to the manufacturer. The biggest disadvantage of backward integration for trader is that it discourages them for innovation, on the other hand forward integration discourages producers to innovate. This theory is not parallel to transaction cost theory which does not consider forward and backward integration as a separate concept.
Many researchers like Armour, Teece, Langlois, Robertson, Gopala Krishnan, Bierly (1980, 1989, 1992, 1996, and 2001) have stated that vertical integration facilitates the development and implementation of systemic innovations. Further, Armour and Teece (1980) argue that if the innovation at one stage involves adaptation in a preceding or a consequent stage, then the usual ownership of the various stages i.e. vertical integration enables the necessary adaptations and adjustments to be made in a timely and efficient fashion.
Similarly Langlois, Robertson (1989) and Langlois (1992) propose that vertical integration is the most appropriate organizational structure for integrative systemic process innovations because the necessary learning and experience proceed faster between functions in a vertically integrated environment. Furthermore, Teece (1996) explains that vertical integration enables the successful development and implementation of systemic innovations by facilitating information flows and coordination and removing institutional barriers such as cost and benefit allocation. Similarly, Gopal krishnan and Bierly (2001) point out that open exchange of information is easier and safer in house than between different organizations because each firm wants to gain more from the innovation and therefore unwilling to share information freely.
Teece (1996) however adds that while systemic innovations favour vertically integrated structures from the coordination point of view and some relevant technological or other capabilities needed in the development and implementation of the innovation may exist outside of the vertically integrated firm. Therefore, larger firms may still have an advantage by using their scale to create sufficient momentum and attract smaller firms to get involved with the innovation or simply by being able to secure minority investment positions in smaller firms that have the necessary capabilities needed in the innovation.

Weakness of Engro Foods
Weakness of Nestle Pakistan
Packaging:
Engro Food is dependent on Tetra Pak for packaging of its entire dairy products. It is the only option for them as Tetra pack has monopoly in packaging sector. This cause higher production costs.
Distribution cost:
About 85% milk collection centers of Engro Foods are located in Punjab, and its processing facility is in Sind. This huge distance increase distribution cost and increasing overall cost of production. Also it increases the chances of milk getting spoiled due to long travelling time.
Narrow Product Line:
Since the launch of its first dairy product, Engro Foods has only extended to very few products, where as its competitors like Nestle has diversified and extensive product lines.
Owning Red Color:
Engro Food like its competitors has not owned colors that identify its products. Colors represent products, like green represents Milkpak. There is no color connection attached to Olper's which creates problems for consumers in remembering the product.
Less Proactive:
Nestle being a huge company is very less proactive to the demands. Unless competitors initiate a campaign or come up with new strategy, Nestle does not bring changes.
Limited Distribution Channel:
A major weakness of Nestle is their limited distribution channel as compared to their competitors. Nestle distribute their products to whole sellers in their own factory vehicles.

Government Funding:
Government has provided increased funds to farmers. This has allowed farmers to invest in better storage facilities to save milk for longer period of time and to cope bad weather conditions.
Awareness:

This will create higher demands and consumption of processed milk. This is a great opportunity for growth and to gain more market.
Fifth Largest producer of milk:
Pakistan is the 5th largest milk production country in the world, the country is blessed four seasons and high quality crop, good species of buffaloes and cows and largest canal system. However it is only obtaining 2500ltr of milk per annum from an animal in comparison with 18000ltr per animal in developed countries. This is a good opportunity to increase production significantly by adopting best practices and modern techniques.
Support from Foreign Investors;
Government is supporting overseas outlay in Pakistan which is a great opportunity for Nestle to expand its business in Pakistan and to cater large markets.
Enhance Distribution Channel:
Nestle should work on its distribution channel to make it efficient in order to maintain supply of their products. This will not allow consumer to shift to competitors brand in case of stock outs.
Changing Social Trend:
Consumers, especially younger generation are hugely influenced by western societies. This has changed the trends for packed ready to use products. This changing social trend has created large demand and opportunity to increase market share.

Perceptions and Price Differentials:
Consumer preferences and perceptions plays very important role in success of a brand. It is very important for Engro to understand and come up with ways to meet consumer expectations and provide quality that a brand promises.

6.2 Pest Analysis
PEST analysis is used to determine and understand external factors such as Political, Economical, Social and technological, and their effect on business. For understanding Nestle and Engro foods position in market, we will carry out PEST analysis to understand the external forces.
6.2.1 Political, Legal & Economic Factors
Pakistan current fiscal year inflation rate has been grown to 7.7% which decreases the purchasing power of consumers as a whole and which also create higher impact on those products which transform from another products like packed milk & powder milk because these is already sell on high prices in market because of high quality so this whole scenario directly create impact on those organization whole deals or manufacture these products like Engro & Nestle, they have two option in this situation either to sustain prices or to decrease prices on the other hand government regulation related to taxes become more contracting day by day and government is not given any compensation in current budget policy.
Engro and Nestle also facing competition new domestic player are entering in the dairy and food sector, so they have to increase their investments in order to remain the market leaders. For example Nirala, Good milk and Pakola are the few names which have recently introduced their dairy product lines in the market. Major textile groups are also entering into dairy and livestock business and some of them have even acquired lands to start their business. In March this year, Nestle Pakistan opened a state of the art milk processing facility in Kabirwala, Punjab. This plant of Nestle Pakistan is the largest milk reception facility in the world which has a processing capacity of 2 million liters of milk per day.
6.2.2 Socio Cultural Factors
In order to make a noticeable increase in saturation many challenges and perceptions still have to be overcome by the Engro and Nestle. The least important one perhaps is tradition as still urbanized consumers have the perception that the arrival of the doodhwala at their home on his trusty bicycle has the fresh and natural milk which is coming straight away from the cow and still it is this perception that only loose milk is fresh.
Over the years, all companies of this sector especially the two older players; Nestle and Haleeb while on the other hand in order to convert loose milk consumer in to processed milk consumer Engro Foods Limited have been making dynamic efforts by various development program in interior sindh. Regardless these campaigns will not change perception of loose milk consumer overnight but it is not impossible, it take time and continuous investment create awareness of the processed milk to the consumer of loose milk. Every product's whole period consists of a starting phase, expansion phase and maturity phase.
Another hurdle which is facing by Engro Foods and Nestle is the price to convert loose milk users to processed liquid milk. The situation is worst in Punjab as most of the dairy farms are located there and the the price of loose milk very cheap as compare to the price of Olpers and Milpak. In Sindh, however, the price differential between loose and processed milk is very narrow. As a result of price considerations Engro Foods and Nestle have not increasing their prices rapidly. Moreover, Nestle and Engro have introduced smaller packages to cater to consumers with limited cash flows although there is a convenience factor at play here as well.
6.2.3 Technological Factors
In year 2005, the Ministry of Industries and Production established Dairy Pakistan Company on the lines and model of Australian Dairy. The main objectives of the company are as under:
To advance milk and other dairy products in the domestic as well as international markets.
To promote advancement of dairy supply chain in Pakistan by supporting and make it easy for the farmers.
To support dairy division development by way of supporting and facilitating business development services for the enterprises across the dairy value chain.
To promote skill improvement, transfer, assimilation, streamlining, acquiring and/or up-gradation across dairy value chain by undertaking new initiatives.
To help introduce global best executive practices for better productivity and operational efficiencies.
To promote education and skills advancement of human resources associated with the dairy sector.
This Dairy Pakistan Company plays a vital role in the dairy industry and the two major player of this industry the Engro foods and Nestle Pakistan are now heavily focusing on the technological factor. Engro Foods has developed the 3rd generation UHT milk plant in the country. It is the only plant that uses Bactofuge technology to virtually eliminate bacteria and ensure premium quality and hygiene. Whereas, Nestle has built two training farms to educate and train the local farmers. The main training facility is the Sarsabz Demonstration and Training Farm which is located on Multan Road, near Okara. The second training Sukeki Farm, is under construction near Lahore.
6.3 Secret of their Success (Engro Foods Limited & Nestle Pakistan)
As we all know in processed milk industry Engro Foods limited is now at the top of it in term of quality and market share. The main reason of its success is their Supply Chain Strategy and before making Supply Chain Strategy they make Nestle as a benchmark. Before establishing this unit, initially their top management realized that if milk and ice cream is going to be our core products then supplier will be the most important area to be maintain because they analyzed that minor lacking in supply chain management system will cause them in facing imbalance demand and supply, Low quality, issues raise in infrastructure and less knowledge among farmers. So in this way they started to make partnership with suppliers and support its strategy of establishing long term relationship with its suppliers by helping them in difficult times. In order to lower than their transportation cost they made strategic moves by establishing two production plants in Sahiwal and Sukkur which are near to farmers and cattlemen's. In this way Engro Foods lower their transportation cost and other issues like less time to reach production area so they easily manage cooling temperature for the production of ice cream. And not only educated local people of interior regarding farming but also built new farms co-operated with UNDP and Pakistan Dairy Development.
The second most important step which Engro Foods took to make their strategy more effective and efficient is that they started Livestock Development Program to build awareness among local public of interior sindh to how to cattle their sheep, goats and cows better, this whole program was stated with UNDP collaboration through this program interior locals increase milk yield and also use livestock potential. The best part of their supply chain strategy is that their strategy starts from customer need rather than raw materials procurement, this approach lead them to success.
Storage
Processing
Transportation to plant
Packaging
Customer Need
Raw Material Acquisition
Warehousing
Distribution
Retailer
Whole seller
Final consumer
The main success of Engro Foods is there supply chain and their approaches toward supply chain are different which is not followed by any other competitors of this industry. And the other factor of EFL success is their advertising which creates big impact on the consumers; especially in Ramadan they launch very attractive and very appealing advertise through electronic media.
Similarly Nestle Pakistan is one of the top leading companies in dairy products. The secret of their success is almost same like Engro Foods they built their production plant in those villages from where farms are near like in Kabirwala and Sheikhupura. The main difference between Engro Foods and Nestle is that the Nestle is the first mover in processed milk who come with the idea for those women who are professionals and who are unable to feed their infant children, so with this idea they made a formula of processed milk in late nineties and after getting bigger success in Europe they thought to move to Asia. And in Pakistan they are running their operation with same strategy as Engro Foods is following like establishing new farms but they did it before because Nestle was the first company in Pakistan who come up with the idea of making new farms in order to improve quality and transportation cost but they didn't take a part in development of cattleman's regarding milk collection like Engro Foods did it.
7. Conclusion
Nestle is one of the leading and the most renowned multinational company of food and beverages sector which is enjoying a leading position in the food and beverage industry of Pakistan however Nestle Pakistan should focus more on its marketing via other Medias such television commercials and news papers ads like other competitors to achieve higher market share in its growing industry locally and transfer its lower cost benefit to its consumers in order to create long term loyal consumers.
Engro Foods Limited current standings and market share is totally in favour of them because of their supply chain management strategy approach and it can be expect that in long term their position will sustain their position because of their good will which is being created secondly the company is backed by a very strong group in term of reputation and financial position in market.
8. Recommendation
1. Nestle should invest more in the marketing activities for Nestle Milkpak.
2. Nestle should need to create strong brand loyalty among its consumers for Milkpak as now there are many competitors in the market that are trying to outperform each other.
3. While designing any strategy for the products the company should keep in the intricate competitive environment
4. The company should try to create the lasting impression of its milk products on its customers through easily recallable jingle bells like Haleeb used; "Sabs se Gharra Doodh Haleeb, Chai Bnaye Khoob Haleeb."
5. For Nesvita the company should concentrate on both genders and of all ages instead of just concentrating on just young women.
As far as Engro Foods Limited is concern they should sustain their current position in order to launch differentiated products timely in future like Nestle introduced Maggi something like that they should introduce because in this sector EFL has a gap. And Dairy Technology Program should be starting in order to make production more efficient and effective like they previously started Livestock Development Program.
