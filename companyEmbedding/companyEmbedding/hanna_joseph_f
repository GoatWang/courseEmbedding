Description

                    A man is found dead in a secured room of a large drug manufacturer. His mistress has been called the most beautiful woman in the world. When she turns her charms on Lawton Close, he doesn't stand a chance. Still, the question remains, Who killed her last lover? How was it done?  The cops think it must have been suicide but Lawton Close knows better. Everyone is at risk, especially Max, Lawton Close's chief investigator, because the world's most beautiful woman has an equally beautiful sister.  Not everyone will make it. Could this be the last book in the "Lawton Close series"?show more

Overview



When beautiful socialite Edwina Borning loses her sight in an acid attack, she withdraws from her promising political career and withdraws from the world. Unfortunately the assets she controls have been placed in a blind trust and are the key to the family fortune. Her sister turns to Lawton Close. LT sends his trusted associate and man-of-action Max to interview the victim of the attack, but Max in turn becomes a victim of the famous Borning charm. Search for the attacker turns deadly. Is it revenge, power, sex, money or all of the above that has driven someone to murder? The list of suspects includes a U.S. Senator, the head of an alleged crime family, a fast talking industrialist, a prep school dropout fighting an addiction and the partners in a powerful New York Law firm.

Joseph Hanna has a varied background that includes a brief time on the road as a professional musician, a number of years spent in a recording studio as engineer, producer, songwriter, technician, and commercial voice. He has written for audio magazines and for two decades wrote a humor column for a weekly newspaper in the Hamptons. He has also been an industrial designer, a cabinetmaker, an architectural drafter, and once sold caviar and luxury goods online. His experience may give others some hope that a B.A. in English does not necessarily have to hold you back.     He lives in Asheville NC with his wife and a dog.
