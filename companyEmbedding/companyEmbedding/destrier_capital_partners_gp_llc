NGL Energy Partners LP Announces Transaction with ArcLight Capital 
      Partners






January 08, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NGL) today announced that it has entered 
      into an agreement with an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners 
      (“ArcLight”) to sell TransMontaigne GP LLC (“TLPGP”) for $350 million in 
      cash. TLPGP is the general partner of TransMontaigne Partners L.P. 
      (“TLP”) and holds the 2% general partner (“GP”) interest and incentive 
      distribution rights (“IDRs”) of TLP. NGL expects to close the 
      transaction by the end of January 2016 and will use the cash proceeds to 
      repay borrowings outstanding on its revolving credit facility.
    


      Mike Krimbill, CEO of NGL Energy Partners stated: “I believe this is a 
      very positive transaction for both NGL and ArcLight. NGL will remain the 
      long-term exclusive tenant in the TLP Southeast terminal system and we 
      look forward to our ongoing partnership with ArcLight. ArcLight has been 
      great to work with and NGL will enter into certain commercial 
      transactions with, as well as provide various transition services for, 
      ArcLight.”
    

      “We are excited to acquire a leading refined products platform that is 
      complementary to our recent activity in the refined product storage and 
      logistics segment,” said Dan Revers, Managing Partner and co-founder of 
      ArcLight. “The acquisition of TransMontaigne GP will mark the fourth 
      major refined product terminals acquisition in the last twelve months 
      and is emblematic of a concerted strategy to acquire and develop 
      infrastructure along the refined products value chain. We are also 
      pleased to continue the long-term relationship with NGL as a significant 
      customer and look forward to expanding the relationship as we grow the 
      assets.”
    

      The TransMontaigne marketing business is a significant part of NGL’s 
      refined products business (and will remain with NGL) uninterrupted by 
      this transaction. NGL will retain TransMontaigne Product Services LLC, 
      its customer contracts and its line space on the Colonial and Plantation 
      pipelines.
    

      With respect to the impact on NGL’s EBITDA, the transaction results in 
      an increase of an estimated $20 million annually from cost reductions 
      and revenue enhancements. NGL will no longer receive $7.6 million of 
      distributions associated with the IDRs and GP interest it owns in TLP, 
      resulting in a net increase of about $12 million going forward.
    

      NGL will retain approximately 3.2 million common units it owns in TLP 
      and has granted an option to ArcLight to purchase 800,000 of those 
      common units at a future date.
    

      Mike Krimbill added: “Within a 75-day period, NGL will have reduced 
      capital requirements by approximately $200 million through the 
      previously announced Grand Mesa / Saddlehorn transaction, and raised 
      $350 million in cash in this transaction, while generating additional 
      EBITDA and DCF. These recent actions provide many benefits to NGL and 
      position it to successfully execute its growth plans in what continues 
      to be a challenging market environment for MLPs.”
    


        The net sale proceeds fund NGL’s growth capital expenditures for the 
        next 18 months, and therefore, NGL does not expect to access the debt 
        and equity capital markets to provide such growth capital.
      

        The net proceeds from this transaction will significantly reduce 
        leverage and increase liquidity.
      

        NGL can reduce leverage further through the sale of its approximately 
        3.2 million TLP common units.
      

        NGL has no significant debt maturities until the fourth calendar 
        quarter of 2018.
      

        Beginning in the 4th calendar quarter of 2016, NGL 
        anticipates significant additional EBITDA from its Grand Mesa pipeline 
        project, which will further strengthen NGL’s credit profile and 
        enhance unitholder value.
      


      In conclusion, this transaction positions NGL to complete its growth 
      projects at an attractive cost of capital, reduce leverage, bridge to 
      the Grand Mesa pipeline in-service date and continue paying its $2.56 
      annual common unit distribution.
