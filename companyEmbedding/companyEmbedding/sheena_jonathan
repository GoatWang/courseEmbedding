matthew-rabinowitz-Natera_5.png

 

Matthew Rabinowitz, Ph.D.
Chief Executive Officer
Dr. Matthew Rabinowitz has had dual careers in industry and academia. While completing his dissertation, Dr. Rabinowitz co-founded an intelligent online merchandizing company, Panop.com, which later sold for $100M. Shortly after, Dr. Rabinowitz started his second company, Rosum, which developed a location technology using TV signals to augment GPS. He received the World Economic Forum “Technology Pioneers” award for founding Rosum and Natera.
In 2003, Dr. Rabinowitz’s life took a turn; a family member had a child born with a genetic disease, and the child passed away in infancy. Dr. Rabinowitz experienced firsthand the trauma, stress, and devastation that an unexpected diagnosis of genetic disease can bring to a family and was moved to action.
Drawing on expertise from his seemingly unrelated background, Dr. Rabinowitz embarked on a journey to ensure that other families need not experience similar pain. Through a team of experts in medicine, engineering, statistics, and genetics, along with Dr. Rabinowitz's own skills in optimization, signal processing, informatics, and entrepreneurship – Natera was born. Natera’s results have been remarkable; Dr. Rabinowitz and the entire Natera team are dedicated to bringing breakthrough technology to all.
Dr. Rabinowitz is now an authority in the field of prenatal and preconception informatics-based genetic testing. He has served as the Principal Investigator on six research grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health. Multiple publications have emerged in leading journals including Bioinformatics, Human Reproduction, and Molecular Human Reproduction. He actively presents at medical conferences around the world, including at the annual meeting of the American College of Medical Genetics, American Society of Reproductive Medicine, and Fetal Medicine Foundation World Congress.
Dr. Rabinowitz is a board member, advisor, and angel investor for multiple companies in biotechnology, communications, cleantech and healthcare. He has received the Scott Helt Memorial Award from IEEE and was selected by MIT Technology Review Magazine as one of the top 35 technology innovators under 35 in the United States.
Dr. Rabinowitz completed his B.A., M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees at Stanford University, receiving both the Levin and Terman Awards — the highest academic honors offered in engineering and physics — and a graduate fellowship to the school of engineering.

After leaving UCLA, Mr. Chapman worked in a commercial role with Genzyme Genetics, where his team was responsible for prenatal and preconception genetic testing revenues nearing $100 million. During his time at Genzyme, Mr. Chapman’s efforts reshaped the way medicine is practiced when he led Genzyme’s sales initiative into population screening for Fragile X Syndrome. He established the largest global network of physicians who routinely screen for the disorder, and radically altered the way the test is offered. In 2005, he elevated carrier screening for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) to the forefront of business development efforts at Genzyme, playing a critical role in the groundbreaking launch of SMA carrier screening. Today, SMA screening is recommended by the ACMG and is routinely offered to couples across the United States. At Genzyme, Mr. Chapman was the direct recipient of 27 sales awards and was a two-time winner of the prestigious Alpine Award, which recognizes outstanding achievement and innovation. Since joining Natera in 2010, he has been responsible for building Natera’s sales and managed-care teams and has also led the commercial team. He has also overseen the successful launch of five products and the establishment of the premier worldwide distribution network for noninvasive prenatal testing.

Jonathan Sheena founded Natera Inc.
            








 



The prenatal testing industry is shaping up as one of the most competitive in the medical diagnostics arena, and the Bay Area has become a center of innovation and new-company formation with the likes of Aria Diagnostics in San Jose, Verinata Health in Redwood City and Natera Inc. in San Carlos.
What's more, as my colleague Diana Samuels wrote earlier this year, the fight has turned to the courtroom as Bay Area test makers challenge each other and Sequenom Inc. (NASDAQ: SQNM), the San Diego-based company that was first to the market with a non-invasive test.

Jonathan Sheena founded Natera Inc.
                        










 


The competition makes it all the more important for these companies to prove that their technology is best, and one of the more aggressive companies in that regard has been Natera.
The 120-employee company, formerly known as Gene Security Network, has doubled its workforce this year, most recently bringing on former Exelixis and Genentech executive Gautam Kollu as vice president of marketing and business development. It moved in May from Redwood City to new digs in San Carlos, and earlier this year it completed a $20 million funding round with Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Claremont Creek Ventures.
The company launched tests in 2009 and 2010 that screened embryos at in vitro fertilization clinics for Down syndrome. Another test in 2010 provides information about extra or mission chromosomes, deletions or duplications and a noninvasive paternity test hit the market last year.
This year, it introduced a test to determine whether parents carry one or more gene mutations, and later this year it expects to start selling a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic, or NIPD, that detects genetic abnormalities, including for Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome, Patau syndrome and certain sex chromosome abnormalities.
I spoke recently with Jonathan Sheena, Natera's founder and chief technology officer, about the company's non-invasive prenatal tests, its ongoing clinical trials, its hiring and its attempts to win insurance coverage for its tests.




Q.: Have you settled into the new building?

Sheena: Over the past year, we grew out of the Redwood City space and on May 1 we moved to new space in San Carlos. We moved from 7,000 square feet to 21,000 square feet.
We were bursting at the seams in Redwood City. In the past year, we've more than doubled headcount. We're now over 120 people.
Q.: Why all the hiring?
Sheena: It supports our new test that we launched and the upcoming NIPD test. We launched our paternity test last year and the screening test earlier this year. We have several NIPD trials, including the prenatal trial, and we released initial validation data.
Q.: So many life sciences companies have been holding tight on hiring, trying to be more efficient. What were some of the internal discussions before you decided to bring on more people?
Sheena: It's hard to know when to pull the trigger, but we made sure the test met the needs of the market. Since we know something performs better and provides better clinical coverage, we were confident to begin staffing. The staffing supports tests that we're selling already, so we can hire people and they have something to sell.
Q.: In which areas of expertise have you hired?
Sheena: We staffed up the lab to support the increase in samples. We staffed up G&A for customer support and insurance billing, which we deal with on behalf of patients, and our sales team, and we continued to round out the R&D team.




 


The R&D team's getting bigger, despite the fact that we've launched, not smaller.
We're also staffing up marketing. We brought in Gautam Kollu from Exelixis and our COO, Brad Roberts, in the past year.
Q.: What are the costs of the tests?
Sheena: The paternity test -- the first noninvasive test -- is billed at about $1,600 in the U.S. and distributed through DDC (DNA Diagnostics Center) and others.
The prior-to-conception test is covered by insurance with a low out-of-pocket cost.
Testing in (in vitro fertilization) ranges from about $1,500 to $5,000, depending on the complexity of the test.
Q.: Have you had to fight with insurers for coverage?
Sheena: There are a number of the big players that have positive policies for prior-to-conception to help women who have had multiple miscarriages.
Some (insurers) are very supportive, some not supportive.
We published one paper on prior-to-conception and another one is coming out to show the clinical utility of the prior-to-conception test for insurers. Our test can find something indicative of a molar pregnancy.
[A molar pregnancy occurs when tissue that normally develops into a fetus instead forms an abnormal growth in the uterus.]
When you have a molar, you can't go to term (with the pregnancy) and it's an indicator to watch for certain cancers. It provides closure to the mother on why the miscarriage happened, but you can detect certain things to watch for cancer.
We started this journey in IVF -- we tested embryos three days after conception -- and added the prior-to-conception test that has added utility.
Q.: What's the money behind Natera?
Sheena: We have three sources of funding. We get revenue from our current tests; (venture backing from) Sequoia, Lightspeed and Claremont Creek; and our third backing is from NIH grants for developing a number of our tests. We're the only company with NIH backing for NIPD tests.
Q.: Are noninvasive prenatal diagnostics the summit of product development in this space?
Sheena: It has the broadest reach, the biggest impact on lives. It's the next summit, but there are other summits right after that. There are all sorts of directions that you can take this NIPD testing.
We're excited by the NIPD tests because they have twice the clinical coverage and shorter turnaround times and higher accuracy because of the different approach we take. The industry standard is about two weeks to 10 business days for turnaround time; our informatics allow us to have a more-targeted approach, shorter turnaround time.
We're launching with a seven-day guarantee.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
