Company Overview[edit]
Plex Systems began as an internal IT project at an automotive parts manufacturer, MSP Industries Corporation, in 1989. The company was formed as Plexus Systems LLC in 1995, providing client/server manufacturing software based on Progress Software's database technology. The company began offering its software via the software as a service (SaaS) or cloud computing model when Plexus Online was launched in 2001.[3]
In 2006 Apax Partners acquired a majority interest in the company.[4] In 2009, the company changed its name to Plex Systems and renamed its flagship product Plex Online.[5] On June, 2012, the company announced the acquisition from a group of share holders, including Apax Partners by Francisco Partners.[6][7] In June 2012, Accel Partners invested $30 million in Plex:[8] In June 2014, Plex secured $50 million in additional funding led by T. Rowe Price, which joined existing investors Francisco Partners and Accel Partners:[9]
Aberdeen Group suggested in its "Aberdeen AXIS: ERP in Manufacturing 2009” report that Plex Systems was among the top four performing ERP vendors.[10] Plex was the only ERP software solution provider placed entirely within the “Champion” performance category,[11] just ahead of SAP AG. (There is evidence of Plex acting as a sponsor for Aberdeen Group[12][13] so this report from Aberdeen may be biased) However, other vendors evaluated in the same report are also sponsors of Aberdeen Group.[14][15][16][17]
Historically, the company has not released detailed financial information, citing its status as a privately held corporation. However, in May 2012, the company reported a revenue increase of 30.6% in the first quarter ending March 31, compared to a year earlier. Recurring revenue increased by 30.5 percent, representing the 19th consecutive quarter of growth."[18]
Plex is known as the first provider of a complete SaaS ERP solution for manufacturing companies.[19] Several IT software bloggers have written about Plex’s ability to provide a wide scope of critical features for manufacturers in a SaaS model, where larger ERP vendors had not succeeded at the time.[20][21]
In 2014, the firm raised $50 million in funding to support expanded product development, as well as investments in marketing and sales.[22]
The Plex Manufacturing Cloud[edit]
The Plex Manufacturing Cloud is a software as a service (SaaS) or cloud application ERP that manages the manufacturing process and supports the functions of production, inventory, shipping, supply-chain management, quality, accounting, sales, and human resource departments, in addition to the traditional ERP roles of finance/accounting, procurement, human capital management, etc.[23] Plex is targeted towards manufacturing industries with rigorous traceability, quality and food safety requirements, including automotive, aerospace, food & beverage, and life sciences or medical manufacturing.[24][25] The system must be accessed using a web browser, making its functions available from anywhere with an Internet connection.[26] The software is designed to provide managers and engineers with real-time visibility to production data.[23]
While Plex Systems calls the SaaS solution "ERP", the software also includes the following integrated functions:

Enterprise resource planning (ERP):
Manufacturing execution system (MES) or manufacturing operations management (MOM)[26][27]
Quality management systems (QMS).[23] It helps maintain compliance with quality standards including ISO 9000 and ISO 14000, QS-9000, TS-16949, AS-9100, etc.
Customer relationship management (CRM)
Supply chain management software (SCMS):

Software as a service (SaaS) or cloud application[edit]
The Plex Manufacturing Cloud is built on a multi-tenant architecture. Software as a service (SaaS) (also referred to as cloud application) is an application delivery model in which the user accesses software over the Internet, from anywhere, at any time. The physical location and ownership/maintenance burden of the system that actually serves the software is outside the responsibility and concern of the end users.[28] Some IT professionals have expressed concern about moving ERP to a SaaS model. At the same time many companies have successfully performed such deployments with Plex Systems and other providers.[29][30] SaaS applications are deployed atop the platform layer of the cloud computing stack. These applications tend to be sold as a subscription, shifting the burden of the software cost across the useful life of the software, and trend to be accounted as an operating expense (OpEx). This is in contrast to traditional methods that require upfront payment or financing and tend to be accounted as a capital expense (CapEx).[31]

The product redesign was late, the workload was increasing, promised headcount additions weren't coming through, and moral was low.- As Winter turned to Spring, something very refreshing came out of the company meeting that changed my perspective of Plex - honesty. Revenue targets were lowered. Our Board of Directors finally understood that the growth they modeled in Excel wasn't going to happen by hiring n+1 salespeople. I feel bad for those that were let go, but I sometimes wonder if those requisitions ever should have existed in the first place. The truth is that the product wasn't ready for the kind of customers they thought they were going to sell to. That doesn't mean the product isn't robust, it just means that we need to spend a bit more on adding features/polish to compete against our larger competition. And that's OK!- Spring brought investments in tooling and process workflow that finally started to show some results. If you're not measuring your performance, you're just guessing. Internal quality metrics were published, which was fantastic to see. Data doesn't lie. I'm glad Plex made investments in this area, it was very much needed.- While Summer at Plex has been busy, we’re finally getting the headcount in certain areas that we were promised at the beginning of year.- Hackathons are coming! Yes! This is an extremely important recruiting tool - continual self improvement/creativity should be a core tenant of Plex culture.- We made a strategic acquisition that seems to be a good fit. Time will tell.- Healthy snacks! Thanks for the additional weekly fruit from Nino's : )Cons- Still quite a bit of politics. Let’s talk about the elephant in the room – key management positions are not held by people with global manufacturing experience. If you want to grow the product into something that punches above its weight, you need people from Fortune 500 manufacturing companies that have extensive manufacturing/supply chain experience. We’re presently clueless about how to grow the product – we ask our Top 10 (by their subscription revenue) customers what they want to see built. What?! Just because they want something developed doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the right strategic investment for Plex. The fact we’re guessing on what to build next is scary to me. We need talent from Intel/GM/Ford/GE/Dell or consultants from PwC/Ernst & Young/ Deloitte/ KPMG, who have worked on large global manufacturing projects and know what large customers are looking for, directing product development. The current product management decisions do not inspire confidence.Advice to Management- Keep the administrative & sales vs. product development & support ratio in balance. Let the product sell itself; ultimately the market will discover the true value of what you're offering. It always does.- I understand the desire to attract talent outside of Detroit, but the number of key personnel/managers working remotely outside of Troy is still too large. How can these people make any sort of meaningful impact on the product without actually working face to face with the people that are building/using it on a day to day basis? Again, be honest with yourself - you need to be here to shape product design. We need people that are passionate about Plex's success - if you aren't at Tower building the product or influencing how it should be built, you are a B/C player in it for the compensation. A-level players are passionate about their work because it's an extension of who they are. If these out of state people you hired are so talented, help ($) relocate them to Troy. Either go all the way with the investment or hire local - this half way stuff isn't good for Plex or the remote hire. And look, I get that we live in a world where Skype for Business/Webex/Zoom is just a tap away on our iPhone - that still _does not_ replace being at Tower, down on the engineering/implementation/support floors. True leaders lead the charge with the troops, and are down in the foxhole from time to time; they don’t issue edicts from the Boardroom.- Since I’m assuming the Board is financially astute, I very much hope you’re following the peculiar movements of US equity markets – it seems the market is levitating upward based on earnings misses (Macy’s / Berkshire Hatahaway) that beat expectations. This sort of 1999 craziness is usually followed by a harsh recession. The Fed has propped up asset prices to an untenable level, and things will be correcting soon (although markets can stay irrational longer than shorts can stay liquid). I’m glad we’re looking to break even financially by the end of the year. Please keep a healthy cash position in 2017 so Plex can weather the storm. Winter is coming.- Be honest with yourself, the product, the employees, and the customers. Eventually, the truth always reveals itself.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (16) Plex Systems, Inc.

Company Overview[edit]
Plex Systems began as an internal IT project at an automotive parts manufacturer, MSP Industries Corporation, in 1989. The company was formed as Plexus Systems LLC in 1995, providing client/server manufacturing software based on Progress Software's database technology. The company began offering its software via the software as a service (SaaS) or cloud computing model when Plexus Online was launched in 2001.[3]
In 2006 Apax Partners acquired a majority interest in the company.[4] In 2009, the company changed its name to Plex Systems and renamed its flagship product Plex Online.[5] On June, 2012, the company announced the acquisition from a group of share holders, including Apax Partners by Francisco Partners.[6][7] In June 2012, Accel Partners invested $30 million in Plex:[8] In June 2014, Plex secured $50 million in additional funding led by T. Rowe Price, which joined existing investors Francisco Partners and Accel Partners:[9]
Aberdeen Group suggested in its "Aberdeen AXIS: ERP in Manufacturing 2009” report that Plex Systems was among the top four performing ERP vendors.[10] Plex was the only ERP software solution provider placed entirely within the “Champion” performance category,[11] just ahead of SAP AG. (There is evidence of Plex acting as a sponsor for Aberdeen Group[12][13] so this report from Aberdeen may be biased) However, other vendors evaluated in the same report are also sponsors of Aberdeen Group.[14][15][16][17]
Historically, the company has not released detailed financial information, citing its status as a privately held corporation. However, in May 2012, the company reported a revenue increase of 30.6% in the first quarter ending March 31, compared to a year earlier. Recurring revenue increased by 30.5 percent, representing the 19th consecutive quarter of growth."[18]
Plex is known as the first provider of a complete SaaS ERP solution for manufacturing companies.[19] Several IT software bloggers have written about Plex’s ability to provide a wide scope of critical features for manufacturers in a SaaS model, where larger ERP vendors had not succeeded at the time.[20][21]
In 2014, the firm raised $50 million in funding to support expanded product development, as well as investments in marketing and sales.[22]
The Plex Manufacturing Cloud[edit]
The Plex Manufacturing Cloud is a software as a service (SaaS) or cloud application ERP that manages the manufacturing process and supports the functions of production, inventory, shipping, supply-chain management, quality, accounting, sales, and human resource departments, in addition to the traditional ERP roles of finance/accounting, procurement, human capital management, etc.[23] Plex is targeted towards manufacturing industries with rigorous traceability, quality and food safety requirements, including automotive, aerospace, food & beverage, and life sciences or medical manufacturing.[24][25] The system must be accessed using a web browser, making its functions available from anywhere with an Internet connection.[26] The software is designed to provide managers and engineers with real-time visibility to production data.[23]
While Plex Systems calls the SaaS solution "ERP", the software also includes the following integrated functions:

Enterprise resource planning (ERP):
Manufacturing execution system (MES) or manufacturing operations management (MOM)[26][27]
Quality management systems (QMS).[23] It helps maintain compliance with quality standards including ISO 9000 and ISO 14000, QS-9000, TS-16949, AS-9100, etc.
Customer relationship management (CRM)
Supply chain management software (SCMS):

Software as a service (SaaS) or cloud application[edit]
The Plex Manufacturing Cloud is built on a multi-tenant architecture. Software as a service (SaaS) (also referred to as cloud application) is an application delivery model in which the user accesses software over the Internet, from anywhere, at any time. The physical location and ownership/maintenance burden of the system that actually serves the software is outside the responsibility and concern of the end users.[28] Some IT professionals have expressed concern about moving ERP to a SaaS model. At the same time many companies have successfully performed such deployments with Plex Systems and other providers.[29][30] SaaS applications are deployed atop the platform layer of the cloud computing stack. These applications tend to be sold as a subscription, shifting the burden of the software cost across the useful life of the software, and trend to be accounted as an operating expense (OpEx). This is in contrast to traditional methods that require upfront payment or financing and tend to be accounted as a capital expense (CapEx).[31]

Company Overview[edit]
Plex Systems began as an internal IT project at an automotive parts manufacturer, MSP Industries Corporation, in 1989. The company was formed as Plexus Systems LLC in 1995, providing client/server manufacturing software based on Progress Software's database technology. The company began offering its software via the software as a service (SaaS) or cloud computing model when Plexus Online was launched in 2001.[3]
In 2006 Apax Partners acquired a majority interest in the company.[4] In 2009, the company changed its name to Plex Systems and renamed its flagship product Plex Online.[5] On June, 2012, the company announced the acquisition from a group of share holders, including Apax Partners by Francisco Partners.[6][7] In June 2012, Accel Partners invested $30 million in Plex:[8] In June 2014, Plex secured $50 million in additional funding led by T. Rowe Price, which joined existing investors Francisco Partners and Accel Partners:[9]
Aberdeen Group suggested in its "Aberdeen AXIS: ERP in Manufacturing 2009” report that Plex Systems was among the top four performing ERP vendors.[10] Plex was the only ERP software solution provider placed entirely within the “Champion” performance category,[11] just ahead of SAP AG. (There is evidence of Plex acting as a sponsor for Aberdeen Group[12][13] so this report from Aberdeen may be biased) However, other vendors evaluated in the same report are also sponsors of Aberdeen Group.[14][15][16][17]
Historically, the company has not released detailed financial information, citing its status as a privately held corporation. However, in May 2012, the company reported a revenue increase of 30.6% in the first quarter ending March 31, compared to a year earlier. Recurring revenue increased by 30.5 percent, representing the 19th consecutive quarter of growth."[18]
Plex is known as the first provider of a complete SaaS ERP solution for manufacturing companies.[19] Several IT software bloggers have written about Plex’s ability to provide a wide scope of critical features for manufacturers in a SaaS model, where larger ERP vendors had not succeeded at the time.[20][21]
In 2014, the firm raised $50 million in funding to support expanded product development, as well as investments in marketing and sales.[22]
The Plex Manufacturing Cloud[edit]
The Plex Manufacturing Cloud is a software as a service (SaaS) or cloud application ERP that manages the manufacturing process and supports the functions of production, inventory, shipping, supply-chain management, quality, accounting, sales, and human resource departments, in addition to the traditional ERP roles of finance/accounting, procurement, human capital management, etc.[23] Plex is targeted towards manufacturing industries with rigorous traceability, quality and food safety requirements, including automotive, aerospace, food & beverage, and life sciences or medical manufacturing.[24][25] The system must be accessed using a web browser, making its functions available from anywhere with an Internet connection.[26] The software is designed to provide managers and engineers with real-time visibility to production data.[23]
While Plex Systems calls the SaaS solution "ERP", the software also includes the following integrated functions:

Enterprise resource planning (ERP):
Manufacturing execution system (MES) or manufacturing operations management (MOM)[26][27]
Quality management systems (QMS).[23] It helps maintain compliance with quality standards including ISO 9000 and ISO 14000, QS-9000, TS-16949, AS-9100, etc.

This is in contrast to traditional methods that require upfront payment or financing and tend to be accounted as a capital expense (CapEx).[31]

SOFTWARE / VIDEO:  Opened Software and Videos
    may be exchanged within 30 days of your product's shipping date, for the same item

Calculating Your Refund
When the item is returned in
its original condition with all original packaging, your credit card will be credited for the price of the
purchase and any taxes, excluding shipping costs and re-stocking fees. If the return is due to a  MyPilotStore error, the return shipping charges will be waived. 
Many times we charge a 
discounted shipping cost for the original shipment.  If you return an item 
and the outbound shipping cost was greater than you paid, the difference will 
be deducted from your return.  For example, if we charged you $4.95 for 
shipping and our actual shipping cost was $8.50 we will deduct $3.55 ($8.50 
minus $4.95) from the value of the return.

If you need clarification on 
this return policy, please
email us at service@MyPilotStore.com.

Plex Terms of Service

Revised July 10, 2015
Thank you for using Plex! By accessing, using, downloading, or visiting any Plex “Service(s)”, which includes the Plex website, Plex software and products described here, and any other products or materials provided by Plex GmbH, a Swiss company, and its affiliates (together, “Plex”), you agree to the terms (“Terms”) listed in this agreement (“Agreement”). Plex reserves the right to amend these Terms at any time and without notice. Any revisions to the Terms will be posted on the Plex website. By continuing to access or use the Services, you accept any changes or revisions to the Terms.
Plex Software

Plex grants you a personal, non-commercial, worldwide, royalty-free, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Plex as part of the Services (“Software”). This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services in the manner permitted by these Terms.
The Software includes certain executable modules that Plex has licensed from third party providers (“Third Party Components”) that may be subject to different end user license terms as specified in the license agreement(s) provided with such Third Party Components.
Except as provided in the next section, you may not, or allow anyone else to, directly or indirectly to: (1) copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Software; (2) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or structure, sequence, and/or organization of all or any part of the Software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission; (3) rent, lease, or use the Software for timesharing or service bureau purposes; (4) develop any improvement, modification, or derivative works of the Software, or include any portion thereof in any other product, software, work, equipment, or item (except that you may customize and/or modify the Software only as set forth in the documentation or as authorized in any license agreement of Plex’s third party licensors and applicable to Third Party Components); or (5) allow the transfer, transmission, export, or re-export of the Software or any portion thereof or any technical data associated with any Software.
Plex grants you a personal, non-commercial, worldwide, royalty-free, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and non-exclusive license to reproduce the Plex Media Server Software (PMS Software) in copies and distribute the copies to others, provided that: you may not charge a fee for the PMS Software, and you may not individually charge for installing it; you may copy, distribute and install the PMS Software only as others actually need the PMS Software, and not more than five (5) times per calendar day or more than twenty-five (25) times per calendar month; you may not offer the PMS Software to the public for downloading on or in connection with any commercial online site, whether or not a fee is charged for the PMS Software; you shall comply with all other terms and conditions set forth in this document; you agree that Plex may revoke or terminate the license granted to you under this paragraph at any time for any reason in its sole discretion. As an example, this section is intended to permit reasonable copying and distribution of the PMS Software in connection with services such as home theater or home media center installation in which you install the PMS Software on the computers of your customers as a convenience in connection with other services or products that you are providing to them, and/or in Arch Linux repositories and similar distributions.
You shall maintain and shall not remove nor obscure any proprietary notices on the Software, and shall reproduce such notices exactly on all permitted copies of the Software.
You may reverse engineer the Software solely (1) as permitted by applicable law, or (2) for the purpose of debugging modifications made by you to certain third party files in source code format that are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or under the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPL2) and only provided that you have made, prior to any such reverse engineering permitted under this sentence, unsuccessful prior reasonable good faith efforts to debug such modifications using techniques other than the reverse engineering of the Software.
As between the parties and except as otherwise provided in any license agreement for Third Party Components, Plex shall own all title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Software, and any copies or derivative works thereof, except that by downloading the Software, you retain any title that you may own in and to the recording media on which the Software is recorded.
You understand that Plex or its licensors may modify or discontinue offering the Services at any time.
You shall not make, or assist others in making, any use of data adapters or similar technologies used by or with the Services that are designed to receive and use data from Plex, its third party data providers, and their affiliates and third parties, other than to receive and use such data in accordance with these Terms and your agreement with the third party data providers, and their affiliates and third parties, including without limitation any data passing through the Services or otherwise effectively made available by any Service through an API, a download, a database, or the like.
This Agreement does not entitle you to any support, upgrades, patches, enhancements, or ﬁxes (collectively, “Support”) for the Services. Any such Support for the Services that may be made available by Plex, in its sole discretion, shall become part of the Services and will be subject to these Terms.

Data
Data provided by Plex or other third party data providers may be delayed or unavailable as specified by Plex or such third party data providers. Plex does not verify any data provided by Plex or other third party data providers and disclaims any obligation to do so. Plex, its third party data providers, and each of their affiliates and business partners: (1) expressly disclaim the availability, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of any data or third party data provider, and (2) shall not be liable for any errors, omissions, or other defects in, unavailability of, delays or interruptions in such data or third party data provider.
Acceptable Use

You may not, or allow anyone else to, use any of the Services to do the following:

Infringe the intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy of any third party;
Violate any law, statute, ordinance, or regulation, or perform any other action that would incur civil liability or constitute a crime;
Disseminate, transfer or store information or materials in any form or format that is harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable, or that otherwise violate any law or right of any third party; or
Disseminate any software viruses or any other computer code, files, programs, or the like that may without limitation interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment, violate the security of any computer network, or the like.


If the occurrence of any prohibited use comes to our attention, we reserve the right to disable any accounts associated with prohibited use or otherwise terminate your access to the Services.

Your Content

You continue to retain any ownership rights you have in content you make available via the Services, or otherwise use in conjunction with the Services. However, by using the Services with particular content, for example by using the Services to share particular content or access particular content, you grant to Plex (and to each of the third parties with whom we work to provide you with the Services) a worldwide license to reproduce, modify, create derivative works, transmit, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute, and otherwise use the particular content and metadata associated with the content, such as images of you or images otherwise associated with your account. The rights you grant us in this license are only for the limited purpose of providing you with our Services. You may not use the Services in connection with any content for which you do not have the right to grant us this license.
The Services may include features that allow you to share your content with others. Please be careful when choosing to share content with other users; Plex is not responsible for how others use your content. Additionally, you hereby grant to any user with whom you share content a non-exclusive license to access the content through the Service, and to use, reproduce in copies, distribute, display and perform the shared content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under this Agreement. You may not share any content with others via the Services if you do not have the right to grant this license to any user with whom you share the content.
You understand that Plex may delete any content that you post in or contribute to a message forum or similar service that Plex hosts, in its sole discretion, for any reason.

Content of Others

You acknowledge that all content that you access through use of the Software or other Services is accessed at your own risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage or liability to any party resulting from such access.
You understand that by using the Services you may encounter content that you may find offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Plex does not inspect, screen, or otherwise control the content that is posted, shared or made available via the Services, and Plex does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such content.
You acknowledge that unauthorized use of copyrighted content of others may subject you to civil and criminal penalties, including possible monetary damages, for copyright infringement.

Developers and Interfacing Software

“Interfacing Software” means any software that you obtain or provide and that accesses or calls any Software provided by Plex as part of the Services including, but not limited to, plug-ins for the Services, channel plug-ins, metadata agents, and client applications that communicate directly or indirectly with the Services.
By making, or assisting others in making, Interfacing Software, you agree to the following terms:

You grant Plex and its affiliates worldwide a worldwide, non-exclusive, and royalty-free right and license to use (including testing, hosting and linking to), copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce in copies for distribution, and distribute the copies of any Interfacing Software made by you or with your assistance.
You will include in the source code of the Interfacing Software a copyright notice of the form: Copyright © <year> <copyright holders>. You grant, and authorize Plex to grant on your behalf if necessary, a license, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Interfacing Software and associated documentation files from Plex, to deal in the Interfacing Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Interfacing Software, and to permit persons to whom the Interfacing Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Interfacing Software. THE INTERFACING SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE INTERFACING SOFTWARE.
You may notify us if you do not wish for Plex to use, distribute, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce in copies for distribution, or distribute copies of any Interfacing Software that was created by you. Plex will comply with such a request but Plex must be granted a transition period of thirty (30) days after receipt of the request to comply.
A request to take down Interfacing Software must include (1) an identification of the Interfacing Software you wish to be removed; (2) your signature in either electronic or physical form; and (3) the following statements:

“I swear under penalty of perjury that I am the owner of the Interfacing Software or I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the Interfacing Software.”
“I swear under penalty of perjury that the information in this notification is accurate.”


You shall protect the privacy and legal rights of Plex users. If the users provide, or the Interfacing Software accesses or uses, user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that such information will be available to the Interfacing Software, and you must provide privacy notices and protection for those users in compliance with applicable law. Further, the Interfacing Software may use that information only for the limited purposes for which the user has given you permission to do so. If the Interfacing Software stores personally identifying information of users or information that a reasonable user would consider to be sensitive, then the Interfacing Software must do so securely and only for as long as it is needed. However, if the user has opted or entered into a separate agreement with you that allows you or the Interfacing Software to store or use personally identifying information of users or information that a reasonable user would consider to be sensitive, then the terms of that separate agreement will govern your use of such information. If the user provides the Interfacing Software with Plex account information, the Interfacing Software may only use that information to access the user’s Plex account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
Prohibited Uses. Plex prohibits performing certain actions using the Interfacing Software. You shall not make, or assist others in making, any Interfacing Software that:

Knowingly violates a third party’s terms of service;
Violates any applicable laws or regulations;
Interferes with, disrupts, damages, harms, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the machines, hardware. devices, servers, networks, data, or other properties or services of any other party including, but not limited to, Plex users, Plex or any network operator;
Posts misleading information about an application’s purpose;
Infringes on the intellectual property rights of others; or
Performs any other prohibited action listed under “Acceptable Use” above.


You will require your end users to comply with any applicable law and these Terms. You will not knowingly enable your end users to violate applicable law or these Terms.
You shall indemnify and hold harmless Plex and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, licensors, suppliers, distributors, contractors, agents, and third party contributors from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs and fees (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from any use of the Interfacing Software or from Plex’s distribution of the Interfacing Software.
Brand Features and Attribution

“Brand Features” is defined as the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of a party. Except where expressly stated, these terms do not grant either party any right, title, or interest in or to the other party’s Brand Features. Any use by you of Plex’s Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to the benefit of Plex. Plex Brand Features include the Plex Play Logo (“>” in stylized format) and the trademarks, trade names and designs as may be identified from time to time in the Plex Trademark Notice that is posted at https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/.
You must seek prior written approval from Plex to display Plex’s Brand Features, including for the purpose of promoting or advertising that your Interfacing Software is for use in conjunction with Plex Services. Plex, in its sole discretion and in a separate writing such as an e-mail from an authorized representative of Plex, may grant you a revocable, non-transferable, nonexclusive license, without right of sub-license, to display Plex’s Brand Features for the purpose of promoting or advertising that your Interfacing Software is for use in conjunction with Plex Services. You understand and agree that Plex has the sole discretion to determine whether your attribution(s) and use of Plex’s Brand Features are in accordance with the above requirements and guidelines and that Plex may revoke the license granted herein at any time, or may require you to modify your use of Plex’s Brand Features, for any reason in its sole discretion.

You grant us all necessary rights for the above purposes.





Children
While Plex does distribute products that may be used by children, the Services are not intended to be used by children, without involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or legal guardian. Therefore, if an account owner sets parental controls or establishes sub-accounts that the account owner intends to permit a child to use, the account owner should not reveal the account password to the child. Plex and its contributors may not provide controls that restrict the maturity level of content available via Plex and an adult account owner has sole responsibility for determining what maturity level is appropriate for or accessible to any children whom the account owner permits to use the Plex service or a sub-account.

ALL THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS ALSO APPLY IN FULL WITH RESPECT TO PLEX’S LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, AND THIRD PARTY CONTRIBUTORS.

PLEX’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU TO PLEX (IF ANY) FOR THE PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE THAT GAVE RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES OR $100 (U.S.), EXCEPT WHERE NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN WHICH CASE PLEX’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MINIMUM AMOUNT PERMITTED BY SUCH APPLICABLE LAW. ALL THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ALL THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO PLEX’S SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, AND THIRD PARTY CONTRIBUTORS. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

This website and other Services may provide links to websites, software, or other materials provided by third parties.

Malware

You acknowledge that the Internet, Internet service providers, shared or dedicated telecommunication lines, wireless access points and wireless networks, other forms of communication, online resources including websites and cloud computing environments, or other means that you use to connect to the Software may not be secure and may be vulnerable to attack by third parties, and that it is possible to receive Malware by using the Internet, dedicated lines, other forms of communication, or other means. In order to protect the Software, you shall regularly obtain, use, and update appropriate third party software or other means to protect yourself from Malware and to detect and remove Malware that may be downloaded using the Internet, dedicated lines, other forms of communication, or other means. Plex does not warrant that the Software will be free of Malware including, but not limited to, Malware that is introduced by third parties, the Internet, dedicated lines, other forms of communication, or other means.

Any such termination or suspension shall be made by Plex in its sole discretion and Plex will not be responsible to you or any third party for any damages that may result or arise out of such termination or suspension of your access to the Services.
Miscellaneous

This Agreement does not give you any rights not expressly and unambiguously granted herein.
No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Plex in any respect whatsoever.
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with Plex’s prior written consent. Plex may transfer, assign, or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent.
Plex’s failure to enforce any right or provisions in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such or any other provision.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, as if made within California between two residents thereof, and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, but without limiting Plex’s right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, any disputes arising with respect to this Agreement shall be referred to an arbitrator affiliated with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”). The arbitrator shall be selected by joint agreement of the parties. In the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating party providing the other party with written notice that it plans to seek arbitration, the parties shall each select an arbitrator affiliated with JAMS, which arbitrators shall jointly select a third such arbitrator to resolve the dispute. The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties. The arbitration proceeding shall be carried on and heard in Santa Clara County, California using the English language and pursuant to the rules of (and administered by) JAMS. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees from the other party. A separate written license agreement or order and signed by Plex and you or your company, employer, or principal may state other terms and conditions that apply to you, including terms relating to price, payment, delivery, confidential information, support services, and the like. You are solely responsible to review such terms or conditions with your company, employer or principal. In the event of any conflict in terms, the terms of the separate license agreement shall supersede the terms of this Agreement.
Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

Plex is Built for Manufacturers



ERP Software Solutions
ERP System




Manufacturing ERP software is not all the same. Historical ERP software solutions involve painful implementation projects followed by challenging periodic updates – often forcing companies to go years without updating their ERP system. Meanwhile, these same companies lose value day after day as new features and functions elude them, only implemented with the next painful ‘big bang’ upgrade.
Modern manufacturing ERP software from Plex takes a different approach. No more waiting. No more upgrades. New features are added daily to a single line of code, shared instantly with all Plex customers. Those customers not only realize renewed value daily, but share best practices real time with other peer Plex customers, all of which have access to exactly the same features, functions and capabilities enabled by a true, single ERP software code SaaS cloud offering.
ERP software solutions should truly be just that; solutions. Manufacturers are often tempted by ERP software vendors touting strong financial, accounting, and even retail ERP software solutions and systems. None of these, however, do the one thing they need particularly well – manufacturing.
Plex is different, offering the only ERP software solution built from the ground up in the cloud and focused exclusively on manufacturing. At Plex, we know manufacturing isn’t just part of the business: manufacturing is the business. The Plex ERP software solution is purpose-built to fit your manufacturing business needs, evolving with you while adding value daily.
Manufacturing ERP software is not all the same. Plex can help you be different. Find out how.






Manufacturers have moved beyond the need for non-integrated point solutions to solve their challenges – they require a true ERP system. Beyond individual, bolt-on products, an ERP system enables connectivity between companies, their customers and their suppliers.
An ERP system must fit the business needs of a given company, while offering a broad array of capabilities designed for that business. With an eye toward the future, the right ERP system gives companies the power to scale at their pace while adding constant value in real time.
Move your business forward with a true ERP system. Find out how.

Tekni-Plex Inc.
        Tekni-Plex Inc.'s new medical molding plant in Suzhou, China.
    

Tekni-Plex Inc. is expanding its global footprint and product offerings through two of its subsidiaries.
First, the firm is investing $15 million for a new manufacturing facility in Suzhou, near Shanghai. Officials said it represents the single largest recent investment by Tekni-Plex, responding to the growing needs of the Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical and medical device markets. The site will manufacture products from three of the firm's units — Natvar, Colorite and Action Technology.
In a joint move, the facility will produce Natvar's recently announced silicone extrusion tubing capabilities for catheters, feeding tubes, drug delivery and peristaltic pump applications, as well as microextrusion tubing that targets many neurovascular interventional therapies and surgical applications.
And in the U.S., Tekni-Plex's Colorite unit recently established a new dedicated line for TPE extrusion at its Holland, Ohio, facility, localizing its Cellene-branded line of TPEs in North America for medical devices, packaging and other regulated markets.
"The new China facility offers specialized space for building a medical component and assembly business as well as opportunities in silicone," Russell Hubbard — vice president, international and general manager, Tekni-Plex Technologies Suzhou — said in an email. "It complements the new investments in Costa Rica with state-of-the-art facilities and strengthens our testing capabilities in Asia."More space needed
The Suzhou plant spans 140,000 square feet and is only about 30 miles away from its current Suzhou site, which it is designed to replace. Hubbard said the facility will employ about 140, with more jobs as business dictates. He added that while the new factory has comparable total space, it also has a better layout and material flow. It provides about five times the clean room space compared to its former facility.
Production has stopped at the old location, and Hubbard said almost all of the employees from the old site have accepted jobs at the new one.
"We've been working for the last three or so years on putting up a new facility in China," Natvar General Manager Bob Donohue said. "The reason we moved is we outgrew the environment. We needed to open a new facility with larger clean rooms and better flow for increased silicone extrusion, injection molding and microextrusion production capacity."
The facility is designed to give Tekni-Plex a stronger presence in what it views as a growing Chinese market for medical devices. The firm said Natvar's new tight-tolerance microextrusion silicone medical tubing and overall expansion of its silicone extrusion capabilities should give it a key advantage.
The firm currently has microextrusion capacity in Costa Rica to serve the Latin America market.
"There aren't a lot of local suppliers [in China] for silicone products," Donohue said. "There was a need and we had a lot of customers that were asking us to manufacture these products in China for medical applications."
Colorite's compounding arm is projected to be operational by September, Hubbard said. Action Technologies' products, including dip tubing and other capabilities, have begun operations at the facility.Coming to America
Heath Schmid, director of business development at Tekni-Plex, said Colorite's decision to localize Cellene production is in response to a trend in the medical field to move away from PVC-sourced products. Currently, the firm's line of TPEs consists of about 28 core products with the ability to custom formulate off of that platform to address more specific needs.
"These materials are recyclable," Schmid said. "When you're going to a TPE versus a silicone or a rubber, there is a cost advantage. There's also a specific gravity advantage, so you're getting the best of both worlds. Your cost per pound is much more affordable than that of a rubber or silicone. A lot of applications that use rubber or silicone are over-engineered, and these compounds lend themselves well as alternative materials for those kinds of compounds."
The official North American launch of the line was at MD&M West in February, and the firm also highlighted Cellene at MD&M East in June. The products previously were produced only at Colorite's Ireland facility, and now are localized in Ohio with the addition of an extrusion line. Schmid said the firm primarily is targeting the medical market, but also sees opportunities in food packing.
Schmid did not disclose how much Tekni-Plex invested in the new Holland line, but said it was "substantial." He added that additional investment might be required as the business grows further.
"As the global landscape changes, there is greater pressure to compete on a global level," Schmid said. "OEMs are being driven by regulatory bodies to offer alternatives to PVC, particularly within the [European Union] and Asia. In North America, hospital systems are becoming much larger, have greater buying power and more influence over which products they utilize in their facilities. They're pushing for PVC-free materials to be used in their hospitals."

"We are delighted to offer Codonics SLS with Plexus TG's Anesthesia Touch™ and Pharmacy Touch™ products to our customers as a fully integrated solution, offering a complete answer for barcode medication verification of IV meds at the point of care in the operating room," said Tony Mira, CEO of Plexus Technology Group. "It has been a pleasure working with the team at Codonics and we look forward to teaming up together on future projects."

This solution simplifies anesthesia medication management with its intuitive, easy-to-use system that delivers to pharmacists and anesthesia providers an integrated solution with controlled-access cabinets, barcoding syringe labeling, closed-loop reconciliation and automated charging.

Botten, President & CEO of Codonics Inc. "Integrating Codonics Safe Label System with Plexus TG's Anesthesia Touch reinforces patient safety throughout the entire surgical process while closing the loop, enabling electronic reconciliation and documentation at the point of care."
