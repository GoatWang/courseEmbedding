History[edit]
In 2012, Profitect, Inc. released a software solution to computationally deliver solutions they historically provided their customers through consulting using analytics with prescribed actions. The Profitect Suite was created to consolidate the tools into a single platform.[7] Since then the company has continuously released newer versions of their solution with ongoing improvements.[8]
Early History[edit]
Profitect Consulting was founded in December 2007 by David Haim and Omer Matityahu.[1] Prior to joining the retail market, David Even-Haim and Omer Matityahu studied and developed their practice of airline anti-terrorism consulting over several years.[citation needed]
The co-founders started Profitect as a consulting firm for security, risk, loss reduction, and prevention. Their first retail consultations were successful, uncovering high value fraud in the supply chain. They found that implementing pattern seeking analytics identified challenges retailers were experiencing before they became a bigger issue.[9] Thus, allowing the company to resolve the issue with timely, detailed, and guided actions.
2010 and Beyond[edit]
In 2010, Profitect moved its corporate headquarters to Waltham, MA, named Guy Yehiav as the new CEO, and relaunched itself as a software company, transitioning from consulting.[10]
Profitect developed a SaaS offering consisting of 8 modules, each focusing on a different area of the value chain. All modules use pattern detection technology and machine learning algorithms to interrogate a company’s data to find anomalies.[3] These anomalies often indicate areas for profit improvement. To capitalize on these profit opportunities Profitect sends alerts to the right manager with a with step-by-step instructions, in plain language, to correct the issue creating the anomalous data.[5] Since the software's original development, the company has released newer versions of their SaaS and have made constant improvements so it is user friendly.[8]
Customers[edit]
Some of Profitect's customers include: Abercrombie & Fitch, Ahold USA, Delek, King Kullen, Sally Beauty, Weis Markets, Factory 54, Woolworths, Suitsupply among many others.[11]

History[edit]
In 2012, Profitect, Inc. released a software solution to computationally deliver solutions they historically provided their customers through consulting using analytics with prescribed actions. The Profitect Suite was created to consolidate the tools into a single platform.[7] Since then the company has continuously released newer versions of their solution with ongoing improvements.[8]
Early History[edit]
Profitect Consulting was founded in December 2007 by David Haim and Omer Matityahu.[1] Prior to joining the retail market, David Even-Haim and Omer Matityahu studied and developed their practice of airline anti-terrorism consulting over several years.[citation needed]
The co-founders started Profitect as a consulting firm for security, risk, loss reduction, and prevention. Their first retail consultations were successful, uncovering high value fraud in the supply chain. They found that implementing pattern seeking analytics identified challenges retailers were experiencing before they became a bigger issue.[9] Thus, allowing the company to resolve the issue with timely, detailed, and guided actions.
2010 and Beyond[edit]
In 2010, Profitect moved its corporate headquarters to Waltham, MA, named Guy Yehiav as the new CEO, and relaunched itself as a software company, transitioning from consulting.[10]
Profitect developed a SaaS offering consisting of 8 modules, each focusing on a different area of the value chain. All modules use pattern detection technology and machine learning algorithms to interrogate a company’s data to find anomalies.[3] These anomalies often indicate areas for profit improvement. To capitalize on these profit opportunities Profitect sends alerts to the right manager with a with step-by-step instructions, in plain language, to correct the issue creating the anomalous data.[5] Since the software's original development, the company has released newer versions of their SaaS and have made constant improvements so it is user friendly.[8]
Customers[edit]
Some of Profitect's customers include: Abercrombie & Fitch, Ahold USA, Delek, King Kullen, Sally Beauty, Weis Markets, Factory 54, Woolworths, Suitsupply among many others.[11]

About Us Profitect is a different type of software company. We improve or replace your current business intelligence and exception based reporting tools, working with all organizations within retail and CPG. Instead of sending someone a report to analyze, just tell them the opportunity and prescribe the actions they should take. It’s that simple.
