* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to

of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.

Description




Key signalized intersection at the entrance to the North Valley Parkway Corridor.  Junction of the two arterials with CAP bridge crossings.  nearly 5 acres of land for neighborhood retail development.  Approved for a 14,000 s.f. anchor, 12,000 s.f. of shops and a corner bank pad.
First-point-of-entry (north-boiund) into the Corridor, a 6-mile stetch of higher-end single-family and Class A apartment communities.  This rapidly-developing corridor, close to major employment is largely unserved by neighborhood retail.  North Valley Parkway's bridge over the CAP Canal is open as of January, 2012, creating an uninterrupted connection to 19th Avenue and the Deer Valley Airport employment centers.

Today I needed some 2x2x8, 1x2x8, furring strips and found all I needed that were not knot infested, and were straight with out having to go through very many pieces. Same with the 2x6x8 pressure treated lumber. 2 young men helped me with the siding paneling by pulling the pieces I wanted then loaded my purchase into my pickup. Todays shopping trip was very successful and pleasant.

The employees at this Home Depot are so great. They helped us pick out the best bug killers because we have a Scorpion problem at our new home. Our problem is Bark Scorpions they are very poisonous so the employees at Home Depot gave us the best advice to our knowledge. From the imfo that i have researched these people were very knowledgeable at Home Depot. I love Home Depot.

The sales specialist named Candy helped us immensley by watching our basket while we went to son's nearby home to pick up a dolly we needed parts for. She also helped us again upon our minutes later return on a purchase of a new dolly She deserves a promotion and/or a healthy bonus. We just moved here from Thousand Oaks CA and she really made us feel welcome here.
