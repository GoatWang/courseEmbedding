Contraindications:
GALLIPRANT should not be used in dogs that have a hypersensitivity to grapiprant.

Warnings:
Not for use in humans. Keep this and all medications out of reach of children and pets. Consult a physician in case of accidental ingestion by humans.

For use in dogs only. Store GALLIPRANT out of reach of dogs and other pets in a secured location in order to prevent accidental ingestion or overdose.

Precautions:
The safe use of GALLIPRANT has not been evaluated in dogs younger than 9 months of age and less than 8 lbs (3.6 kg), dogs used for breeding, or in pregnant or lactating dogs.

Adverse reactions in dogs receiving GALLIPRANT may include vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, mucoid, watery or bloody stools, and decreases in serum albumin and total protein.

If GALLIPRANT is used long term appropriate monitoring is recommended.

Concurrent use with other anti-inflammatory drugs has not been studied. Concomitant use of GALLIPRANT with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as COX-inhibiting NSAIDs or corticosteroids, should be avoided. If additional pain medication is needed after a daily dose of GALLIPRANT, a non-NSAID/ non-corticosteroid class of analgesic may be necessary.

The concomitant use of protein-bound drugs with GALLIPRANT has not been studied. Commonly used protein-bound drugs include cardiac, anticonvulsant and behavioral medications.

Drug compatibility should be monitored in patients requiring adjunctive therapy. Consider appropriate washout times when switching from one anti-inflammatory to another or when switching from corticosteroids or COX-inhibiting NSAIDs to GALLIPRANT use.

The use of GALLIPRANT in dogs with cardiac disease has not been studied.

It is not known whether dogs with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfonamide drugs will exhibit hypersensitivity to GALLIPRANT. GALLIPRANT is a methylbenzenesulfonamide.

Adverse Reactions:
In a controlled field study, 285 dogs were evaluated for safety when given either GALLIPRANT or a vehicle control (tablet minus grapiprant) at a dose of 2 mg/kg (0.9 mg/lb) once daily for 28 days. GALLIPRANT-treated dogs ranged in age from 2 yrs to 16.75 years. The following adverse reactions were observed:

Nocita: Product InformationBy Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. | Last revised: 12 October 2016
 NOCITA- bupivacaine injection, suspension, extended releaseAratana Therapeutics, Inc.  (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension)

 13.3 mg/mL 
 For local infiltration injection in dogs only 
 Local anesthetic 
 Single use vial 
Caution:



Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.

Description:
NOCITA® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white, preservative-free, aqueous suspension of multivesicular lipid-based particles containing bupivacaine, intended for local infiltration at the surgical site in dogs. Each milliliter of NOCITA contains 13.3 mg of bupivacaine. Inactive ingredients and their nominal concentrations are: cholesterol, 4.7 mg/mL; 1, 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3 phospho-rac-(l-glycerol) (DPPG), 0.9 mg/mL; tricaprylin, 2.0 mg/mL; and 1, 2-dierucoylphosphatidylcholine (DEPC), 8.2 mg/mL. Bupivacaine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amide-type local anesthetics. Chemically, bupivacaine is 1-butyl-N-(2, 6-dimethylphenyl)-2-piperidinecarboxamide with a molecular weight of 288.4. Bupivacaine structural formula is shown in the illustration to the right.
Structural Formula

    
      Indication:
For single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to provide local postoperative analgesia for cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs.

Dosage and Administration:
NOCITA is for single dose administration only. A dose of 5.3 mg/kg (0.4 mL/kg) is administered by infiltration injection into the tissue layers at the time of incisional closure. A single dose administered during surgical closure may provide up to 72 hours of pain control.




 Dosing Instructions: 
  Wear gloves when handling and administering NOCITA (see WARNINGS).
 NOCITA should not be allowed to come into contact with topical antiseptics. When a topical antiseptic such as povidone iodine or chlorhexidine is applied, the area should be allowed to dry before NOCITA is administered into the surgical site.
  Do not shake vial. Invert the vial multiple times to re-suspend the particles immediately prior to withdrawal of the product from the vial.
 Do not puncture the vial multiple times. Once the vial stopper has been punctured with a sterile needle, draw out the dose into a sterile syringe. Each syringe should be prepared for single patient use only. Discard the vial after the entire dose is withdrawn.
 Following withdrawal from the vial into a syringe, NOCITA may be stored at controlled room temperature of 68° F to 77° F (20° C to 25° C) for up to 4 hours. After4 hours, the syringe must be discarded.
 NOCITA may be administered diluted or undiluted. NOCITA may be diluted with up to an equal volume (1:1 by volume) of normal (0.9%) sterile saline or Lactated Ringer’s solution to obtain a volume sufficient to cover the surgical site.
 Do not dilute with water or other hypotonic solutions as it will result in disruption of the liposomal particles (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
 Do not mix NOCITA with other local anesthetics or other drugs prior to administration (see PRECAUTIONS).
 Administer with a 25 gauge or larger bore needle.
 Administer by infiltration injection: Inject slowly into the tissues using an infiltration injection technique. To obtain adequate coverage, infiltrate all of the tissues in each surgical closure layer. Aspirate frequently to prevent intravascular administration (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
  Contraindications:
Do not administer by intravenous or intra-arterial injection. If accidental intravascular administration occurs, monitor for cardiovascular (dysrhythmias, hypotension, hypertension) and neurologic (tremors, ataxia, seizures) adverse reactions.

Do not use for intra-articular injection. In humans, local anesthetics administered into a joint may cause chondrolysis.

Warnings:
Not for use in humans. Keep out of reach of children.

NOCITA is an amide local anesthetic. In case of accidental injection or accidental topical exposure, contact a physician and seek medical attention immediately.

Wear gloves when handling vials to prevent accidental topical exposure.

Precautions:
Do not administer concurrently with bupivacaine HCl, lidocaine or other amide local anesthetics. A safe interval from time of bupivacaine HCl, lidocaine or other amide local anesthetic administration to time of NOCITA administration has not been determined.

The safe use of NOCITA for surgical procedures other than cranial cruciate ligament surgery has not been evaluated (see ANIMAL SAFETY and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

The safe use of NOCITA has not been evaluated in dogs younger than 5 months old.

The safe use of NOCITA has not been evaluated in dogs that are intended for breeding, or are pregnant or lactating.

The safe use of NOCITA in dogs with hepatic or renal impairment has not been evaluated. NOCITA is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

The safe use of NOCITA in dogs with cardiac disease has not been evaluated.

The ability of NOCITA to achieve effective anesthesia has not been studied. Therefore, NOCITA is not indicated for pre-incisional or pre-procedural loco-regional anesthetic techniques that require deep and complete sensory block in the area of administration.

Adverse Reactions:
Safety was evaluated in 123 NOCITA treated dogs and 59 placebo treated dogs in a field study in dogs that underwent cranial cruciate ligament stabilization surgery. Dogs enrolled in the study were 1-13 years of age, and weighed 3.4 to 61.3 kg. NOCITA was administered by infiltrative injection at the surgical site at a dose of 5.3 mg/kg (0.4 mL/kg).

Aratana Therapeutics: Will It Get Over Its Manufacturing Issues? - Aratana Therapeutics (NASDAQ:PETX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Aratana Therapeutics: Will It Get Over Its Manufacturing Issues?Jul. 5.17 | About: Aratana Therapeutics (PETX) Avisol Capital Partners Long/short equity, newsletter provider, healthcare, biotechAvisol Capital PartnersSummaryPETX has had trouble delivering drugs even after approval.However, it has a strong pipeline and is doing very well in the approval front.The manufacturing issues are probably short term, and the pullback is an opportunity to invest. By Dr Ashok Dutta, BVSc&AH Aratana Therapeutics (PETX) has three approved products - Nocita, Entyce and Galliprant. Two of these - Nocita and Galliprant - are marketed, and Entyce is awaiting market entry because of a manufacturing issue. Nocita is marketed by Aratana itself, while it has a collaboration for Galliprant with Elanco. There are a number of excellent articles written on PETX here on Seeking Alpha, notably the ones by this author. Even more enlightening are comments by four readers, two of whom are American vets themselves, and two others who are also very knowledgeable. There is no need for me to redo the wheel, and my readers can read those articles and comments to get a well-rounded picture of PETX as an investment. Instead, I will simply provide my own perspective as a veterinary surgeon: what is attractive about PETX as an investment choice while there are so many exciting new developments ongoing in cancer, or CNS, or heart diseases in humans? The very first reason any vet would invest in PETX is because it is a pure-play veterinary medicines developer, and believe it or not, we are proud one of our own is doing good. That is irrational, but that is probably going to be true for many of us. However, there’s a rational aspect to this, and that is true for all investors. That is this: All the large vet medicine developers are attached to, or spun off from, big pharma human meds developers. The movements of their stocks aren’t entirely tied in to the animal medicine market. If you are approaching animal medicine as a hedge investment, you won’t find that with those mixed-pipeline pharma. PETX, on the other hand, is exclusively about cats and dogs and other animals. So, its distinctness makes it simpler as an investment idea. The other reason is its astounding development in a matter of only 4 years of existence. PETX started out in 2013 with the agenda of producing animal medicines out of successful human medicines concepts. In just four years, it has 3 approved products, a long-tailed pipeline, and it only burned through about $250mn of investor money before it produced results. Compare that with any human medicine developer, and these companies often take many decades and many hundred millions of dollars before they are anywhere near an approval. There are other, company specific reasons for liking PETX. Its 3 approved drugs together come to almost a few hundred million dollars in sales potential. Galliprant will only help PETX earn royalties, since the drug was licensed to Elanco from which it will receive double-digit royalties. Given the marketing and sales prowess of the much larger Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) spinoff, Galliprant will perhaps bring a steady flow of revenue to PETX. Nocita is a bit of a specialized pain reliever, indicated officially for local post-operative analgesic for cranial cruciate ligament (CRCL) surgery for dogs. According to the American College of Veterinary Surgeons, “Rupture of the CrCL is one of the most common reasons for hind limb lameness, pain, and subsequent knee arthritis.” However, PETX believes that Nocita may have potential in other conditions as well. Its sales has been modest so far. Entyce is the most interesting of all its drugs and may possibly have wider application across species. I am not aware of its capabilities in the large animal scenario, but loss of appetite is a major problem with many different kinds of animals. So we are looking at a potentially large market for all three drugs combined. However, there’s a puzzling problem with this entire rosy scenario that makes one hesitant to bet much on PETX. The company has very poor manufacturing ability. Time and again, it has failed to deliver medicines after approval. That is the major reason I would shy away from this company. As a small company, PETX must have managed to focus only on its regulatory phase, ignoring its manufacturing phase, and now it is suffering. Earlier, it failed to deliver Nocita to pharmacies and vets. Then, its market launch of Entyce got delayed because of manufacturing issues. Entyce is the first and only CVM approved appetite-stimulant. It was approved last year, but PETX had to get a new manufacturing facility approved because the old one was not able to deliver, it seems - and that delayed the launch. Now it seems that Entyce will only be launched by the end of 2017. Finally, Galliprant is also being manufactured at PETX facilities, and there is concern that Galliprant too will suffer from manufacturing issues. While many of us consider Galliprant a vast improvement on other NSAIDs like carprofen, available as a generic, if you don’t get a good drug even after ordering for months, you will fall back on the more available (and cheaper) drugs, and may actually give up on the new drug that hasn’t filled its order yet. Overall, this small company does not seem to have got a grip of its manufacturing issues yet. Financials Aratana continues to improve its financial standing as shown by its latest quarterly earnings announcement. The company reported a steep rise in its revenue to $3.8 million for the first quarter of the year, from the $172,000 it had reported for the corresponding quarter of the previous year. While the company saw an astronomical rise in its revenue, it also managed to bring its quarterly net loss down to $12.6 million, in comparison to the net loss of $18 million it had incurred in the first quarter of 2016. The company’s total operating costs also decreased from $17.4 million to $15.6 million on a year-over-year basis. The decline was mainly due to Research & Development expenses coming down from $10.7 million to $4.6 million. Aratana expects its operating expenses to further decline as it projected its full year operating expenses to be close to $45 million. With the expected increase in revenue and the decline in costs, the company is likely to contain its net losses in the coming quarters. The company showed a slight increase in its net cash used in operating activities. Aratana’s cash burn in operating activities during the first quarter of the year stood at $18.4 million while the corresponding figure for the first quarter of 2016 was reported at $13.4 million. Despite the increase in its revenue, the company concluded the first quarter with relatively lower cash and equivalents balance than the preceding quarter. The company reported $68.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, while the corresponding balance for the quarter ended on December 31, 2016 was at $88.6 million. Aratana also inked a deal to sell 5 million of its shares to certain investors. The company expects to receive $24.4 million in net payments. Together with these proceedings, Aratana is in position to fund its operations and debt obligations through 2018, putting it in a solid financial position with relatively low dilution risk for the next 18 months. On the other hand, however, PETX is selling about midway from its 52-week high, after having recovered from a major pullback earlier this year, but still a long way to go to its 52-week highs. The manufacturing issues, while a matter of concern, are transient, and investors must understand that the company has three drugs approved and many more in the pipeline and will certainly get over its manufacturing hurdles or get acquired. Either way, there’s strong upside from the current levels. While I would have preferred to say this when it was even further down, I think there’s a good reason it is still a fine investment at these levels.

Why Aratana Therapeutics Inc. Is Tumbling Today
Shares fall in response to news of a delayed product launch.











                Brian Feroldi
            

                (TMFTypeoh)



            
            Feb 6, 2017 at 12:19PM
            
            





What happened
After Aratana Therapeutics (NASDAQ:PETX), a biotech company focused on pet health, announced the delay of a new product launch, shares fell 17% as of 11:15 a.m. EST on Monday.
So what
The pet therapeutics company disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday that the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has requested more information about its appetite stimulant Entyce. Specifically, the CVM is looking for additional data related to the company's plans to transfer the manufacturing of Entyce to a new vendor. 
According to Aratana, this unexpected information request is going to delay the drug's launch until late 2017. Investors are not taking the news well, hence today's decline.

Image source: Getty Images.






Now what
Aratana gained FDA approval for Entyce way back in May 2016, so this update means that it will take the company more than a year to bring this drug to market. That's never a good sign for any biotech company, let alone one that is still losing money each quarter. 
On the positive side, the delay should also allow Aratana to throw more of its resources behind the launch of Nocita. This drug is approved for use in dogs as post-operative analgesia following cranial cruciate ligament surgery. Management stated that gaining market adoption for this drug will take quite a bit of time since access to the surgeons who perform this procedure is much harder than selling to general practitioners. In addition, Monday's update doesn't change the fact that Enctye's market potential remains quite large. 
Still, delays are never good, so it is hard to blame the markets for punishing the company's stock today.

Aratana Therapeutics (PETX) Provides Product Updates  











Tweet








9/25/2015 12:28:40 PM


KANSAS CITY, Kan., Sept. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PETX), a pet therapeutics company focused on the licensing, development and commercialization of innovative biopharmaceutical products for companion animals, today provided several product updates. The Company continues to advance its deep pipeline of novel therapeutics, including four products at pivotal stage (AT-001, AT-002, AT-003 and AT-014), while concluding that post-licensure marketing studies of canine lymphoma products AT-004 and AT-005 will not fully capture the market opportunity. Aratana is pursuing second-generation monoclonal antibodies and other solutions to canine lymphoma.AT-001 (grapiprant for osteoarthritis pain in dogs)On September 8, 2015, Aratana received from the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) the technical section complete letter for effectiveness, which in addition to safety and CMC, constitutes the third and final major technical section complete letter.  Aratana expects to finalize label negotiations, complete the other minor sections and intends to submit an administrative New Animal Drug Application (NADA) in the first quarter of 2016. Approval is anticipated in the second quarter of 2016 and is expected to enable Aratana to commence commercialization of the product in the fall of 2016. AT-002 (capromorelin for inappetence in dogs)On August 26, 2015, Aratana submitted the technical section for effectiveness, which included the results of the positive pivotal field effectiveness study conducted under protocol concurrence with the CVM. Aratana anticipates a response from the CVM by February 22, 2016.Aratana anticipates receiving its technical section complete for CMC in late 2015 or shortly thereafter. Accordingly, Aratana anticipates submitting a NADA in early 2016, which if approved, is expected to enable Aratana to commence commercialization of the product in mid-2016 or shortly thereafter. AT-003 (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension in dogs)On August 23, 2015, Aratana submitted the technical section for effectiveness, which included the results of the positive pivotal field effectiveness study for post-operative pain management in dogs undergoing knee surgery conducted under protocol concurrence. Aratana anticipates a response from the CVM by February 20, 2016.Aratana has received a response to its first CMC technical section submission and Aratana anticipates re-submitting the CMC section in late 2015. Accordingly, Aratana anticipates submitting a NADA, which if approved, is expected to enable Aratana to commence commercialization in late 2016. AT-004 and AT-005 (monoclonal antibodies for canine lymphoma)Aratana has enrolled approximately 50 dogs in its Mini B-CHOMP study, investigating the use of AT-004 in combination with abbreviated chemotherapy in canine B-cell lymphoma. The results are anticipated in mid-2016. Previously, the Company had received encouraging results from three independent studies looking at using AT-004 in combination with chemotherapy.Aratana has been conducting two randomized, placebo-controlled studies (T-CHOMP and T-LAB) looking at the potential benefit of AT-005 in combination with two specific chemotherapy protocols and conducting a clinical experience program (T-CEP), where oncologists use the product at their discretion and share the data with Aratana. Although dogs are still being followed in those studies and final results are expected by mid-2016, Aratana completed an analysis of the results thus far and AT-005 does not seem to be adding significant progression free survival in canine T-cell lymphoma. Recent scientific studies suggest that AT-004 and AT-005 are not as specific to the targets as expected.Given the mixed clinical and scientific results, Aratana does not believe AT-004 or AT-005 in their current, first-generation forms will capture the desired lymphoma market opportunity. Therefore, Aratana is pursuing second-generation monoclonal antibodies and other efforts in lymphoma which are intended to deliver breakthrough benefits.Both first-generation products, AT-004 and AT-005, are expected to continue to be available to oncologists as they are USDA licensed and Aratana is manufacturing these products today. Aratana believes the revenue and gross margin opportunity for the first-generation monoclonal antibodies will be modest, but given that there are not alternative monoclonal antibodies available to veterinarians, Aratana intends to maintain product availability.Steven St. Peter, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aratana Therapeutics, commented "Aratana has been aggressive in its pursuit of truly innovative therapies for pets and we have been remarkably successful from a regulatory perspective.  From a commercial perspective, we only prioritize products that truly hit the mark with respect to addressing unmet medical needs.  We will go back into development when we believe we need to optimize a product to capture a significant opportunity.  The ability to take such a disciplined approach is an attractive attribute of the pet therapeutics opportunity."Aratana will host an investor call to discuss these updates at 8:30 am EST on Friday, September 25, 2015.  Conference Call Information:Interested participants and investors may access the conference call by dialing:1 (866) 364-3820 (U.S.) 1 (855) 669-9657 (Canada) 1 (412) 902-4210 (international) A replay of the call will be available beginning at approximately 10:30 a.m. EST on September 25, 2015.  Access numbers for this replay are:1 (877) 344-7529 (U.S.) 1 (855) 669-9658 (Canada) 1 (412) 317-0088 (international) Conference ID: 10073245 An audio webcast will be accessible via the Investor Relations section of the Aratana Therapeutics website aratana.investorroom.com.  About Aratana TherapeuticsAratana Therapeutics is a pet therapeutics company focused on licensing, developing and commercializing innovative biopharmaceutical products for companion animals.

While Elanco recorded net revenue related to commercial sales to the market, Aratana recorded approximately $2.5 million related to GALLIPRANT product sales as finished goods under its supply arrangement with Elanco and $903 thousand in GALLIPRANT licensing and collaboration revenues during the first quarter of 2017. Aratana continues to believe that GALLIPRANT has the potential to become one of the top recently launched pet therapeutics in the United States. Aratana continues to anticipate marketing authorization in the European Union as early as the second half of 2017.

	Aratana reported NOCITA


	®


	(bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension),


	a local post-operative analgesic for cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs, net product sales of $327 thousand in the first quarter of 2017. As compared to the $147 thousand in the previous quarter, the Company believes the sequential increase in sales is primarily a result of continued growth of new accounts and strong re-order rates, including re-orders from the large majority of the top fifty customers. Aratana has completed a pivotal target animal safety study of


	bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension


	for post-operative pain management in cats and the Company has an ongoing U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA)-concurred pivotal field effectiveness study with results anticipated by mid-2017.
















	·










	The Company met with FDA in April 2017, and Aratana believes it is in agreement on how to proceed regarding the proposed transfer and scale-up of the manufacturing of ENTYCE


	®


	(capromorelin oral solution) for appetite stimulation in dogs. Aratana intends to re-submit the prior approval submission in the coming weeks. If the submission is approved, Aratana believes it would be able to make ENTYCE commercially available by the fall of 2017. Additionally, the Company initiated a pivotal target animal safety study evaluating capromorelin for weight management in cats with chronic kidney disease under an FDA-concurred protocol in the first quarter of 2017 and continues an ongoing FDA-concurred pivotal efficacy study in cats.

	The Company continues to anticipate conditional licensure of AT-014 by the Unites States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the treatment of canine osteosarcoma in the second half of 2017.

	The Company’s collaboration partner, VetStem BioPharma, initiated a pivotal target animal safety study of AT-016, an adipose-derived allogeneic stem cell therapeutic candidate for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, under an FDA-concurred protocol in April 2017. Aratana anticipates results from this pivotal target animal safety study, as well as results from an FDA-concurred pivotal field effectiveness study in 2017.

	Financial Results




	The first quarter net loss was $12.6 million or $0.34 diluted loss per share


	compared to a net loss of $18.1 million or $0.52 diluted loss per share for the corresponding q


	uarter ended March 31, 2016.


	Aratana recorded $3.8 million in net revenues for the quarter en


	ded March 31, 2017, which primarily includes approximately $2.5 million related to GALLIPRANT product sales as finished goods under its supply arrangement with Elanco, $903 thousand in GALLIPRANT


	licensing and collaboration revenues, and $327 thousand in NOCITA net product sales. For the first quarter of 2016, Aratana had $172 thousand in total net revenues.




	﻿




	The cost of product sales totaled $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 in comparison to $19 thousand for the corresponding period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to cost of product sales of NOCITA, and GALLIPRANT initial validation supply produced at higher prices and sold to Elanco for commercial distribution. Cost of product sales is anticipated to increase in 2017 due to the anticipated full year sales of NOCITA and GALLIPRANT, and anticipated partial year sales


	of


	ENTYCE. Aratana believes the cost of product sales as a percent to overall product revenues will improve as the Company moves the therapeutics to full commercial manufacturing scale over time.




	﻿




	Research and development expenses totaled $4.7 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 in comparison to $10.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower milestone payments as compared to 2016.




	﻿




	Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $7.5 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to $6.6 million for the corresponding period in 2016. The increase is primarily related to the expanded commercial organization. Aratana expects selling, general and administrative expenses to stabilize in 2017 with the corporate infrastructure substantially in place to support the continued commercialization of NOCITA and GALLIPRANT, as well as the anticipated commercialization of ENTYCE.




	﻿




	As of March 31, 2017, Aratana had approximately $68.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. During the first quarter of 2017 its cash utilization included approximately $5.0 million of payments for inventory purchases and a $3.0 million milestone payment for the first product sale of GALLIPRANT.




	﻿




	On May 3, 2017, Aratana entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain investors for the sale by the Company of 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $5.25 per share (registered direct offering). The Company entered into a Placement Agency Agreement with Barclays Capital Inc. on May 3, 2017 pursuant to which Barclays agreed to serve as placement agent for the offering. The shares are being offered and sold pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-197414) and a related prospectus supplement. Subject to certain closing conditions, the offering is expected to close on May 9, 2017.




	﻿




	The Company expects to receive net proceeds from the offering of approximately $24.4 million, after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including ENTYCE commercial activities and GALLIPRANT inventory. 




	﻿




	During March and April 2017, Aratana received net proceeds of approximately $2.8 million from the sale of shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to its sales agreement with Barclays, dated October 16, 2015, in which Barclays served as sales agent under the at-the-market (ATM) program. On April 28, 2017, the Company terminated its sales agreement with Barclays because it does not intend to raise additional capital through the ATM program, and no additional shares of the Company’s common stock will be sold pursuant to the sales agreement. 




	﻿




	For the full year 2017, the Company estimates operating expenses of approximately $45 million, which includes approximately $10 million of non-cash expenses. These non-cash expenses are expected to be further off-set by contractual milestones and working capital expenditures, net of modest positive gross margins, totaling approximately $10 million, which we believe will result in approximately $45 million of cash used in operations and investing activities during 2017.












	 


	 






	 




	 








	The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash of $68.4 million as of March 31, 2017, together with the proceeds from its registered direct offering, will allow Aratana to fund the current operating plan and debt obligations through at least 2018. The Company’s current operating plan contemplates the launch of ENTYCE by the fall of 2017 and continued growth in sales of GALLIPRANT, which Aratana believes will result in the achievement of certain milestones under the collaboration agreement with Elanco.




	Webcast & Conference Call Details

					Full Description



Aratana Therapeutics, Inc., incorporated on December 1, 2010, is a pet therapeutics company focused on licensing, developing and commercializing of biopharmaceutical products for companion animals. The Company's portfolio includes therapeutic candidates in development consisting of small molecule pharmaceuticals and large molecule biologics that target medical conditions in pets. The Company's lead product candidates in development include small molecules directed at treating osteoarthritis pain and inflammation (AT-001 for dogs, also known as grapiprant for dogs or GALLIPRANT), appetite stimulation (AT-002 for dogs, also known as capromorelin for dogs or ENTYCE) and post-operative pain (AT-003 for dogs, also known as bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension for dogs or NOCITA). The Company's product candidates also include AT-014 for dogs.AT-001 (grapiprant)The Company's product candidate, AT-001 (grapiprant), is a selective antagonist of the prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2) EP4 receptor (EP4 prostaglandin receptor antagonist or EP4 PRA). EP4 is one of four G-protein coupled PGE 2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4) located on the membrane of various cells in the mammalian body. The EP4 receptor predominantly mediates PGE 2-elicited pain. AT-001 binds selectively to the EP4 receptor with high affinity thus blocking it from PGE 2-mediated pain and inflammation.AT-002 (capromorelin)The Company is investigating its product candidate, AT-002 (capromorelin), for two separate potential indications in dogs, appetite stimulation and weight gain, and for an indication, management of weight loss, in cats. AT-002 is a potent and selective ghrelin agonist. Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide hormone, also referred to as the hunger hormone, produced predominantly in the stomach. It is the endogenous ligand of the ghrelin receptor, also known as growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). By activation of the ghrelin receptor, ghrelin stimulates appetite and growth hormone secretion, and exhibits a role in regulation of gastrointestinal motility and energy balance. Ghrelin binds to specific receptors and affects signaling in the hypothalamus, interacting with other hormones to cause the feeling of hunger and stimulate food intake. In addition to its effects on appetite, ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretion by activation of GHS-Rs in the pituitary. AT-002 demonstrates appetite stimulation and GH-releasing activity. The Company focuses on submitting new animal drug application (NADA) for commercialization of ENTYCE in the United States.AT-003 (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension)The Company is investigating AT-003 for post-operative pain in dogs and cats. AT-003 is an approximately 1.3% bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension consisting of microscopic, spherical multivesicular liposomes. Bupivacaine is released from the particles by mechanisms involving reorganization of the barrier lipid membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug occurs over an extended period of time. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic that prevents the generation and conduction of nerve impulses, apparently by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise in the action potential.AT-001, AT-002 and AT-003 for catsThe Company is investigating the use of its lead molecules in cats. The Company has completed over three proof of concept studies in client-owned cats, including a placebo controlled pilot field study of over 60 cats with degenerative joint disease to develop a study design, establish a dose regimen and test various endpoints. The Company has completed multi-site field pilot study of AT-002 in approximately 40 cats diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and documented weight loss. The Company has completed placebo-controlled pilot field study of AT-003 for cats with postsurgical pain, which demonstrated improvements in pain evaluations compared to placebo.AT-016 for dogsThe Company's product candidate, AT-016, is an adipose-derived allogeneic stem cell product candidate. The Company is developing AT-016 for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain in dogs.AT-018 for dogsThe Company is developing AT-018 as an oral Chemoattractant Receptor Homologous to the T Helper 2 Cell (CRTH2) antagonist for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis, focusing initially on developing the product candidate for dogs. The Company is conducting a multi-center, masked, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot field study in client-owned dogs.BLONTRESS and TACTRESSBLONTRESS is a caninized monoclonal antibody approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB), as an aid for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma in dogs. TACTRESS is a caninized monoclonal antibody approved by the CVB as an aid for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma in dogs.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
