(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following plan of operation provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.  Bang Holdings Corp. was incorporated in the state of Colorado on May 13, 2014. It is a brand management and digital advertising company that provides content and an influencer-based marketing network to the cannabis industry. We are a development-stage company and since our inception we have generated only minimal revenues from business operations.  Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business unless we obtain additional capital to pay our ongoing operational costs. Accordingly, we must locate sources of capital to pay our operational costs.  Our operational expenditures are primarily related to development of Bang's multi-channel advertising network, marketing costs associated with attracting and retaining users, and the costs related to being a fully reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  2015 was a transformative year for Bang Holdings. We quintupled the direct reach of our 4TwentyToday network of channels over the course of the year to around 500,000 users and expanded the reach of our social influencer network to more than 11 million. At five persons, our core team has remained small and highly efficient, and has built a firm foundation for growth in the quarters and years to come.  Business Overview  Bang Holdings Corp wholly owns two subsidiaries, Bang Digital Media, a cannabis focused digital media company, and Bang Vapor, an e-juice company that can crossover to the cannabis market.  Bang Digital Media is the hub for all 'cannabusiness' related advertising, content creation, technology and marketing. It consists of two divisions, the multi-platform 4TTnetwork, and a network of social media influencers that we call the Green Monkey Network.  The 4TTnetwork is comprised primarily of specifically targeted audiences. These are 4TwentyToday, VaporBang, and 4TT/V which cross the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter, Massroots, Instagram and YouTube.  4TwentyToday is a digital, multi-platform channel that enables us to target advertising for Bang Holdings products and services across social media platforms. We currently have in excess of 350,000 users of our network, with a steady growth rate of around two percent per week. By continuing to create targeted, quality content for this community on a daily basis 4TwentyToday has, for example, created one of the most actively engaged marijuana pages on Facebook. This has built high levels of trust and goodwill in the community, which will be convertible to revenues once we have reached a critical mass of users.  Using the same skillset, we are developing VaporBang - a digital, multi-platform community for vaping enthusiasts. At more than 80,000 strong, ours is the largest vaping community on Facebook. This has enabled us to carry out beta testing of our product and to develop strong recognition for the Bang brand while soft-launching our e-liquid.  Our most successful post on Facebook in 2015 had 5.4 million views, leading to 309,000 "reactions," 95,000 "shares," and 92,000 "comments." The post was created to build upon our social media footprint related to our business, not specifically towards our products.  The 'Green Monkey Network' is a network of social media influencers who are open to working as ambassadors in the marijuana industry. These influencers expand the Bang network by more than 10 million users.  Ultimately, the KPI of Bang Digital Media is in the direct and expanded growth of our networks. By continuing to grow 4TwentyToday and the 'Green Monkey Network' to 100 million users we will have the digital reach to propel marijuana-friendly brands into the spotlight.  Bang Vapor is a marketer of vaporizer pens and E-liquid for the vaporizer industry, through the use of a razor and razor blade model. "Electronic cigarettes" or "e-cigs" and "vaporizers" are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide. Electronic cigarettes are comprised of three functional components:  Bang Vapor completed its soft launch in the first quarter of 2016.  Plan of Operations  In the twelve month period, we intend to develop our business in four areas:  � Establish retail distribution with vaporizer shops and tobacco/headshops. There are between 5,000-7,000 "vape shops" that are dedicated exclusively to selling e-liquid and vaporizer pens. In addition, there are approximately 10,000 tobacco shops (or head shops) that have historically only sold cigarettes, tobacco and smoking pipes, but is now offering various vaping products. Our sales team is currently establishing relationships with regional and national distributors, and are attending trade shows. In addition, the Company is currently advertising the products in trade publications and plans to expand these efforts will be attained in relation to the profits generated by the Company. We plan on targeting approximately 1,000 shops during our first year. Our estimated budget for this is approximately $40,000.  � Build partnerships with influential social media personalities and celebrities in several key genres to serve as brand ambassadors. Each brand ambassador will have their own affiliate website to sell Bang products and make commissions off of each sale. By giving a unique platform to YouTuber's and Vine stars to monetize their social media followings, Bang Vapor will be able to build brand awareness and employ an army of influencers to sell product in order to become a leading brand in the e-cig/vaporizer space. Compensation to social media personalities and celebrities will be bonus incentivized along with a commission structure. Therefore, we anticipate no up-front expenditures.  � Open the Bang Vapor Club online. Distribution of our products purchased on-line is anticipated to be performed by the United States Postal Service. We plan on maintaining a limited inventory of several flavor and two personal vapor lines. We plan to expand the inventory line based upon the data we receive during the initial launch of the website. The anticipated cost for completion of the website, maintenance and the development of new features over the course of the next twelve (12) months is approximately $35,000.  If we are unable to build our customer base or gain any clients, we will be forced to cease our development and/or marketing operations until we raise money. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult. As such, if we cannot secure additional proceeds, we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment.  We intend to raise additional capital through private placements now that we have a quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. If we need additional cash but are unable to raise it, we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.  Financing  On August 22, 2014, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Platinum Partners Liquid Opportunity Master Fund LP ("Platinum") whereby the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock to the Company at $0.35 per share for a purchase price of $350,000. In consideration for Platinum agreeing to purchase the 1,000,000 shares, the Company agreed to issue to Platinum share purchase warrants entitling Platinum the right to acquire 1,500,000 shares of the Company's Common stock, at $0.35 per share. In October 2014, Platinum purchased the 10% Convertible Debenture for the aggregate amount of $500,000. On September 25, 2015, Platinum exercised 285,714 warrants for cash proceeds of $100,000. On January 26, 2016 the related party exercised 28,581 warrants for cash proceeds of $10,000. On March 16, 2016 the related party exercised 285,714 warrants for cash proceeds of $100,000. Subsequent to December 31, 2015 the Company's President loaned the Company $30,000 pursuant to a convertible debenture. The Loan bears interest at 10% per annum, is due on January 29, 2017 and is convertible into common stock at $1.50 per share at the discretion of the holder. In addition, the Company agreed to issue 30,000 warrants with an exercise price of $2.00 that expire January 29, 2021.  Results of Operations  For the year ended December 31, 2015 and for period from May 13, 2014 (inception) to December 31, 2014  We have generated $576 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $13 for the period from May 13, 2014 (inception) to December 31, 2014. We incurred operating expenses of $1,403,818 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $604,309 for the period from May 13, 2014 (inception) to December 31, 2014. We had a net loss of $1,697,215 for the year ended December 31, 2015, a majority of which is general and administrative fees of $820,620 and sales and marketing fees of $320,038 compared to a net loss of $760,822 for the period from May 13, 2014 (inception) to December 31, 2014, a majority of which is general and administrative fees of $363,716 and interest expense of $156,628.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. We have been funding our operations through the sale of our common stock.  Our primary uses of cash have been for payroll, marketing, consulting, legal, accounting and audit fees. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity in the near term:  � Development of a Company website  � Exploration of potential marketing and advertising opportunities, and  � The cost of being a public company  Our net revenues are not sufficient to fund our operating expenses. At December 31, 2015, we had a cash balance of $17,264. Since inception, we raised $500,000 and $350,000 from the sale of warrants and a convertible debenture to Platinum Partners Liquid Opportunity Master Fund LP, $66,600 from the sale of common stock through a private placement and $100,000 from the exercise of warrants to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures. We may be required to raise additional funds, particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our operations. We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, that our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations, without further financing, through June 2016. Other than working capital, we presently have no other alternative source of working capital. We may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations. We may need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We do not anticipate we will be profitable in 2016. Therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, the trading price of our common stock and a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations.  We anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly.  Going Concern  For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company has incurred net operating losses and used cash in operations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $2,458,037 and used cash in operations of $519,391 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for marketing of the Company's products which included the general and administrative expenses associated with its organization and product development. We currently have a burn rate of approximately $48,000 a month.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plan provides the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Use of Estimates in Financial Statements  The presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates during the period covered by these financial statements include the valuation of website costs, valuation of deferred tax asset, stock based compensation and any beneficial conversion features on convertible debt.  Fair value measurements and Fair value of Financial Instruments  The Company adopted FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.  Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.  The Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820.  Due to the short-term nature of all financial assets and liabilities, their carrying value approximates their fair value as of the balance sheet date.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC Topic. 605 "Revenue Recognition". In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue when the products are shipped to the customers and collectability is reasonable assured.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The Board received feedback that having different balance sheet presentation requirements for debt issuance costs and debt discount and premium creates unnecessary complexity. Recognizing debt issuance costs as a deferred charge (that is, an asset) also is different from the guidance in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which requires that transaction costs be deducted from the carrying value of the financial liability and not recorded as separate assets. Additionally, the requirement to recognize debt issuance costs as deferred charges conflicts with the guidance in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, which states that debt issuance costs are similar to debt discounts and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing, thereby increasing the effective interest rate. Concepts Statement 6 further states that debt issuance costs cannot be an asset because they provide no future economic benefit. To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2015 did not have any effect on the financial statements.  In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update "ASU" 2014-15 on "Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern". Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans,  In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No.2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date" defers the effective date ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities also may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  Recent accounting pronouncements issued by FASB (including the Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC, did not or are not believed by the Company management, to have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling
security holders. All of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock will
go to the selling security holders. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating 
to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders.


The industry in which we conduct our business is intensely competitive. We
compete with other sellers of electronic cigarettes, personal vaporizers, and
e-liquid flavors. Brands, such as Reynolds, Vuse, Group Mark Ten, Green Smoke,
Blu, Vaporfi, Njoy, Logic, V2, and Apollo all compete in the electronic
cigarette market.

In the refillable personal hardware sector, new competitors emerge constantly
with brands like Kangertech, Innokin, Joyetech, Sensei, Aspire, Tesla, Atmos and
others constantly making their mark with new products as technology evolves. In
the e-liquid flavor space the competition is even larger with new flavor brands
emerging daily due to very low barriers to entry. Companies mentioned earlier
like Vaporfi, Atmos and Njoy also carry their own flavor lines for the
refillable market. Other brands like Mount Baker Vapor focus on wide variety of
choice and value while other brands like Five Pawns, Cosmic Fog, and Suicide
Bunny carve out their identity with branding, and more nuance flavor
combinations. The nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly
fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low.

We plan to compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition,
brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. We are subject to
highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. The competitive
environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak
economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors’ introduction
of low-priced products or innovative products, cigarette excise taxes, higher
absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation
that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products.


Company Description
Bang Vapor is a marketer of vaporizer pens and E-liquid for the vaporizer
industry, through the use of a razor and razor blade model. “Electronic
cigarettes” or “e-cigs” and “vaporizers” are battery-powered products that
enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash or


 carbon
monoxide. Electronic cigarettes are comprised of three functional components:
(i) a mouthpiece, (ii) the heating element that vaporizes the liquid nicotine so
it can be inhaled and (iii) the electronics. Although the Company will generate
revenues from vaporizer hardware sales (sold for between $40 and $200) through
our website www.bangvapor.com and in vape shops nationwide, we will primarily be
enrolling customers in our e-liquid subscription service – i.e. The Bang Vapor
Club. The subscription service works as follows: For $19.95 the club member
receives a starter kit consisting of a free vaporizer pen and three 12ML bottles
of e-liquid – of which, the member can pick any three from our line of 20
gourmet, “Made in the USA” flavors. Thereafter, the customer is automatically
charged $19.95 per month for three 12ML flavors of e-liquid. In order to
maximize retention rates, we give bonus ‘mystery’ gifts to club members every
month – these are low cost, but high perceived value, items such as T-Shirts,
USB Drives, sample bottles of e-liquid and replacement vaporizer hardware. We
will also sign up Bang Vapor Club members via social media influencers who are
being contracted to our Company as brand ambassadors – each of whom have their
own circle of influence of between 150,000 and 2,000,0000 fans.

Concurrently, we are developing the 4TT Network – a digital advertising platform
that enables us to target advertising for Bang Holdings Corp products across
social media platforms. We currently have in excess of 150,000 users in our
social media network, which is growing at a rate of between four and five
percent per week.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling
security holders. All of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock will
go to the selling security holders. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating 
to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders.


The industry in which we conduct our business is intensely competitive. We
compete with other sellers of electronic cigarettes, personal vaporizers, and
e-liquid flavors. Brands, such as Reynolds, Vuse, Group Mark Ten, Green Smoke,
Blu, Vaporfi, Njoy, Logic, V2, and Apollo all compete in the electronic
cigarette market.

In the refillable personal hardware sector, new competitors emerge constantly
with brands like Kangertech, Innokin, Joyetech, Sensei, Aspire, Tesla, Atmos and
others constantly making their mark with new products as technology evolves. In
the e-liquid flavor space the competition is even larger with new flavor brands
emerging daily due to very low barriers to entry. Companies mentioned earlier
like Vaporfi, Atmos and Njoy also carry their own flavor lines for the
refillable market. Other brands like Mount Baker Vapor focus on wide variety of
choice and value while other brands like Five Pawns, Cosmic Fog, and Suicide
Bunny carve out their identity with branding, and more nuance flavor
combinations. The nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly
fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low.

We plan to compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition,
brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. We are subject to
highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. The competitive
environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak
economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors’ introduction
of low-priced products or innovative products, cigarette excise taxes, higher
absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation
that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products.


Company Description
Bang Vapor is a marketer of vaporizer pens and E-liquid for the vaporizer
industry, through the use of a razor and razor blade model. “Electronic
cigarettes” or “e-cigs” and “vaporizers” are battery-powered products that
enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash or


 carbon
monoxide. Electronic cigarettes are comprised of three functional components:
(i) a mouthpiece, (ii) the heating element that vaporizes the liquid nicotine so
it can be inhaled and (iii) the electronics. Although the Company will generate
revenues from vaporizer hardware sales (sold for between $40 and $200) through
our website www.bangvapor.com and in vape shops nationwide, we will primarily be
enrolling customers in our e-liquid subscription service – i.e. The Bang Vapor
Club. The subscription service works as follows: For $19.95 the club member
receives a starter kit consisting of a free vaporizer pen and three 12ML bottles
of e-liquid – of which, the member can pick any three from our line of 20
gourmet, “Made in the USA” flavors. Thereafter, the customer is automatically
charged $19.95 per month for three 12ML flavors of e-liquid. In order to
maximize retention rates, we give bonus ‘mystery’ gifts to club members every
month – these are low cost, but high perceived value, items such as T-Shirts,
USB Drives, sample bottles of e-liquid and replacement vaporizer hardware. We
will also sign up Bang Vapor Club members via social media influencers who are
being contracted to our Company as brand ambassadors – each of whom have their
own circle of influence of between 150,000 and 2,000,0000 fans.

Concurrently, we are developing the 4TT Network – a digital advertising platform
that enables us to target advertising for Bang Holdings Corp products across
social media platforms. We currently have in excess of 150,000 users in our
social media network, which is growing at a rate of between four and five
percent per week.

Marijuana Company Bang Holdings Corp Stock Is Now Trading




















March 08, 2016 12:22 ET

 | Source: Bang Holdings Corp.






MIAMI BEACH, Fla., March  08, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bang Holdings Corp. (OTCBB:BXNG), a marijuana focused holdings company, is pleased to announce that its shares of common stock have been approved to trade by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and became DTC eligible on March 3, 2016 under the ticker symbol "BXNG." “I’m incredibly proud of our team,” stated Bang Holdings CEO Steve Berke.  “In the past 20 months, we have completed our entry into capital markets and built two businesses that are poised to disrupt two separate, but synergistic, multi-billion dollar industries.” Bang Holdings Corp wholly owns two subsidiaries, Bang Digital Media, a cannabis focused digital media company, and Bang Vapor, an e-juice company set to hard launch in the second quarter of this year. Since launching the digital channel 4TwentyToday across multiple digital platforms in July 2014, Bang Digital Media’s network has grown to reach 659,929 engaged marijuana enthusiasts and generated more than 150 million content views. Further, Bang’s expanded network of marijuana-friendly social influencers reaches a further 10 million potential customers. “Bang Holdings is committed to responsible and transparent investments within the marijuana industry,” Berke said.  “We have gone public through the S-1 process, rather than effecting a reverse merger, so we could provide a greater sense of transparency to our shareholders and the public.  And, as a company, we do not directly touch cannabis, which gives our investors a sense of security that we will not be violating any Federal laws.” Berke continued, “We realize that the marijuana gold rush has already begun. So, rather than mining for gold, we prefer to be selling the pickaxes—and in the 21st century, the pickaxes are digital.” Over the next several months, Bang Holdings will sign-up powerful social influencers to our marketing network. We will continue to expand our network of marijuana enthusiasts via 4TwentyToday and other managed channels, along with launching our first line of BANG branded products.              About Bang Holdings: Bang Holdings focuses on investments within the cannabis industry that do not directly touch cannabis.  It currently provides cannabis-related digital content and influencer based marketing for the marijuana industry.  For more information, please visit www.bangholdings.com  This information does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities or assets of Bang Holdings.
