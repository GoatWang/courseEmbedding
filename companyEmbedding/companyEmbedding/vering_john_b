 By Jonathan Moreland, founder of Insider Insights and author of Profit From Legal Insider Trading.   NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Which insiders are selling and buying chunks of stocks? Below are lists of the top 10 open-market insider purchases and sales filed at the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday, February 07, 2012 as ranked by dollar value. Company executives and directors are in the best position to assess the attractiveness of their firms' shares, and here is how many of them are voting their wallets! Please note, however, that these are factual lists, not buy and sell recommendations. Dollar value is only one metric to assess the importance of an insider transaction.
