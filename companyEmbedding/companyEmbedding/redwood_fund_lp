You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

The Redwood Group





























        







 













  
The Redwood Group
The Redwood Group (Redwood) is a specialized logistics real estate investment firm with in-depth knowledge and experience that includes in-house development, leasing and asset management utilizing local teams in China, Japan and Singapore.




 Company Overview



With a primary focus on the identification and professional execution of logistics, warehousing and transportation real estate solutions for customers in selected metropolitan areas within its target geographies, Redwood aims to provide high quality distribution space for some of the largest end users and logistics service providers operating both within Asia and around the world. 
Redwood has an established track record in each facet of industrial real estate development, including: 

Market selection
Identification of transaction opportunities in selected markets
Structuring, financing and packaging investments
Management of developments and investments




Tenant selection and asset management
Sales execution

Redwood's founders, Charles de Portes and Stuart Gibson, pioneered international institutional investment into this asset class in Asia in 1998 with the development of the first build-to-suit distribution hub for DHL, and the creation of the first private equity fund dedicated to Asian logistics real estate in 2002. 
Utilizing its local experience and market knowledge, our dedicated team of real estate professionals seek to identify high quality opportunities in prime, strategic locations for our clients which include some of the best known retailers, manufacturers and third-party logistics companies nationally and internationally, operating in China and Japan.




 Focus & Target Markets





Redwood’s target markets are under-supplied in the type of Class A product demanded by multinational and regional tenants, which results in pent-up demand for such logistics space. This demand, coupled with the compelling growth characteristics in a region driven by the expansion of third-party logistics and e-commerce sectors, provide ongoing opportunities in the warehouse and distribution property sector. 
Redwood’s investments are driven primarily by customer demand for modern logistics facilities with quality specifications and the high through-put efficiencies required by today’s leading logistics operators, retailers, light manufacturers and automotive companies.


The rapid growth in e-commerce, greater supply chain efficiencies and consolidation by third party logistics providers are a major driver of our growing development activity. Our objective is to seek strategic sites to develop the right solutions for our customers across China and Japan.
Our multi-tenant developments in these markets are close to airports, seaports and highway networks to meet customers' needs for import and export logistics and domestic market distribution.






 Management

The Redwood Group was established in 2006 by a group of senior real estate professionals in Asia, with considerable experience in:



Acquisitions
Asset Management
Development and Redevelopment
Leasing
Due Diligence




Financing
Funds Management
Market Research
Structuring



With several decades of accumulated expertise, Redwood's team has executed some of the highest quality distribution and logistics real estate developments and investments in the markets with greatest demand within China and Japan for numerous multinational clients.

 Corporate Responsibility



The Redwood Group places a high priority on operating with best business practice standards, with a well-governed platform based on transparency and with great consideration to our social, environmental and corporate responsibilities to our customers and communities.




  SUSTAINABILITY
Optimizing the sustainability potential in new developments through green design initiatives, positions a property well to minimize its environmental impacts and provide long-term benefits to our customers and the local community.
All developments undertaken by Redwood will be CASBEE (the local Japanese sustainable rating) or LEED certified. All warehouses that we develop are built with energy efficient technology and other features to reduce our customers' costs. Such features include energy efficient lighting, waste water management systems, more than adequate green areas and solar energy generation through solar panels on the roof tops of the buildings.

The Redwood Group - ESR seals deal for proposed phased development of multibillion US$ logistics park. The 140,000 sqm (1.5 million sq ft) prime development site is near Haneda International Airport, one of Japan’s most prized transport hubs
Tokyo/Shanghai/Singapore, 6 July 2016 – e-Shang Redwood (“ESR”), one of the leading logistics fund developers and managers in Asia, announced that it has purchased two of the most significant land parcels to come to the market in Tokyo Bay.   The sites are located in one of the most valuable logistics markets in Tokyo due to its proximity to Central Tokyo, the main Port infrastructure, Haneda International Airport and its position in the densely populated urban continuum between Tokyo and Yokohama. Both sites are currently leased to a credit tenant.
The two prime, undeveloped land parcels have a combined area of 143,839 sqm (43,511 tsubo) and are strategically situated in Higashi Ogijima, Kawasaki-city, Kanagawa prefecture. 
ESR intends to develop three state-of-the-art eight-storey warehouses in phases with a combined NRA of up to 560,000 sqm. The first land parcel (“Site A”) has a total area of 77,723 sqm (23,511 tsubo) and is currently being used as an open-air storage and parking area for the tenant’s heavy vehicles while the second land parcel (“Site B”) has a total area of 66,116 sqm (20,000 tsubo) and currently houses two warehouses which the tenant uses to store equipment and vehicle parts.
The project is located 15km away from Tokyo CBD, in close proximity to Haneda International Airport (5km), Kawasaki Port container terminal (1km) and Yokohama Port (15km). The Higashi Ogijima Interchange (access point) of the Metropolitan Expressway Bay Route is located only 1.6km from the subject site and provides swift access to the motorway connecting Tokyo, Yokohama and Haneda International Airport.
Ben Duncan, North Asia president of CBRE stated: "This is one of the largest master planned distribution parks in the Tokyo area, and especially given its location, it should have broad appeal for a variety of logistics companies operating here."
Stuart Gibson, Co-Founder of ESR and head of its Japan operations stated: "The Bay Area in Tokyo has always been the highest demand location for largescale modern logistics operators.  Currently, facilities in this submarket are running at full occupancy which confirms the strong fundamentals in the Japanese logistics market. We feel excited that the resulting development will arguably surpass most any comparable scheme developed over the last 10 years in the Tokyo Bay area as it will offer leading tenants in the e-commerce, retail and 3rd-party logistics space an unmatched combination of functionality, expansion flexibility and unique locational attributes."

PARE has already committed to 4 co-investments with ESR located in Tokyo and Nagoya. 
By partnering with ESR, PARE is pursuing the significant value creation opportunities afforded by development of state-of-the-art logistics facilities today in Japan. The main Japanese logistics markets of Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya are currently experiencing low single-digit vacancy levels and are poised to experience significant growth to meet the demand for high throughput facilities from 3rd-party logistics providers and e-commerce companies. 
Charles de Portes, President of ESR stated: “We are honoured by PARE’s commitment to ESR and proud to add Ping An Real Estate to our strategic investor relationships. Recent structural changes to the retail and logistics industries globally and within Asia have arguably put logistics real estate on a secular growth trend.  Continued demand coupled with constrained supply of modern stock in Japan are predicted to lead to enduring returns for PARE and others invested in the product in the country’s largest metropolitan areas witnessing both urbanization and globalization of trade.” 
Pierre-Alexandre Humblot, ESR Capital Officer added: “Logistics is a stable real estate asset class offering institutional investors predictability and resilience of cash flow. The timing is particularly auspicious for those forward-looking investors wanting to achieve lasting exposure and access to the asset class.”

PGGM invests further USD160M into Redwood China Logistics Fund. 
Singapore/Zeist, 1 February 2016 — e-Shang Redwood (“ESR”), the Asia-based logistics fund manager announced it has closed a further USD160M from PGGM into the Redwood China Logistics Fund.
After this closing, PGGM has committed a total of USD430 million to Redwood’s China logistics real estate fund (“RCLF”). This latest round marks the third equity commitment by PGGM.
The fund set up in 2012 develops prime distribution and logistics real estate facilities in selected high growth markets in China. The fundamentals of the Chinese logistics sector remain compelling with significant undersupply and pent-up demand for modern and efficient logistics facilities, driven by on-going urbanisation, rising domestic consumption and the growth of the Chinese e-commerce market. 
Charles de Portes and Michael de Jong-Douglas, President of ESR and Managing Director, respectively, issued a joint statement: “We are delighted to further build on our well-established relationship with PGGM, one of the world’s leading pension fund managers. Capturing the strong momentum of logistics real estate growth in China, PGGM’s increasing investments with us in the region since 2012 have proven timely for long-term value creation.  PGGM continues to be a key investment partner and now holds over USD600 million of equity commitments with ESR across China and Japan.”
Thijs Schoenaker, senior investment manager with PGGM Private Real Estate, added: “PGGM is a long term investor with patient capital and has been a seed investor with Redwood in their first investments in China logistics property since 2012. Over the past years they have built up a sustainable and high quality portfolio and platform in China. The merger with e-Shang will further strengthen the platform and add value for their customers in Asia. As a result, PGGM is keen to continue to invest with ESR – as one of our strategic operating partners in Asia.”

Redwood Commences One of the Largest Solar Rooftop Energy Programs in Japan Along with China Expansion 
Tokyo 3 November, 2015 -In-line with its commitment to environmentally sustainable development and operations, the Redwood Group announced its latest solar power generation initiatives in Japan and China.
In Japan, Redwood commenced operation and new build of three large-scale distribution center rooftop solar power plants as part of one of Japan's largest new solar rooftop initiatives, with over a dozen Redwood large-scale solar projects in progress.  The initial three plants' combined output is 4 megawatts. By way of comparison, one megawatt (“MW”) alone is commonly considered enough to power between 750-1000 homes. The three initial plants are distributed around the greater Tokyo region at the Redwood Distribution Centers of Namamugi, Yokohama (1MW); Kawagoe, Saitama (1.5MW) and Sakura, Chiba (1.5MW).  Under the Redwood Renewables program, the solar energy generated will be sold to the Tokyo Electric Power Company at a fixed rate for a 20 year period. 
For the initial three projects, Redwood has partnered with two of Japan's leading solar service providers, Kyocera Solar Corporation (at Namamugi and Sakura) and Chuo Densetsu Co. Ltd. (at Kawagoe), to install and maintain the systems.  The solar panels were provided by two of the largest solar panel manufacturers globally, Japan-based Kyocera and China-based Trina. The Namamugi plant has become fully operational as of October 2015, with Sakura and Kawagoe locations following in November and January thereafter, respectively.
"Redwood prides itself on its commitment to sustainability," said Stuart Gibson, CEO of the Redwood Group. “As well as creating revenue streams from otherwise underutilized areas and in-line with incorporating sustainable practices into the industrial facilities we develop, the solar panels generate clean energy, reduce environmental impact, energy expenses and greenhouse gas emissions. These three facilities are the initial projects of a significant pipeline of rooftop solar plants. At the same time, we also continue to explore other environmental initiatives for our buildings beyond solar, incorporating high CASBEE standards.”  CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency) is the green building management system in Japan.
Bryan Gould, head of Redwood Renewables initiative added: “We are very excited to install these solar energy plants on our new distribution centers in Yokohama, Saitama and Chiba.  Each solar plant produces clean energy at a fraction of retail energy prices. With these newest installations, one achieves the goal of grid parity and a union of commercial and long-term environmental sustainability interests, a priority for Japan and increasingly worldwide.”
In China, at the Redwood Beijing Distribution Center, UGE International Ltd., a leader in renewable energy solutions, was selected to supply Redwood with a state-of-the-art solar energy system. Construction of the system is now complete as of fall 2015. The 248 KW on-site solar energy system will significantly reduce energy costs, operating expenses, and carbon footprint. Colin Clark, Construction Director of the Redwood Group, China comments: "The Beijing project is the first of many for Redwood nationally, solidifying our pioneering commitment to sustainable logistics buildings in China as elsewhere in Asia.”
           
          In recent years Redwood and PGGM (based in the Netherlands, PGGM is one of the world’s largest private investors in real estate) have developed a successful investment partnership. This ambitious solar energy program of Redwood contributes to PGGM’s policy to improve the sustainability performance of its Private Real Estate Fund. Thijs Schoenaker, Senior Investment Manager of PGGM Private Real Estate, comments: "Sustainability is key to PGGM’s activities as a long-term investor. Our ambition is to reduce the carbon footprint of our clients’ portfolios and increase sustainable investments in the coming years. Over the past years we have actively held discussions with our strategic partner, Redwood, about its sustainability plans. These initiatives fit very well into the roadmap to build a best-in class and sustainable logistics property portfolio in Asia for the long-term.”

The Redwood Group Announces Two of the Largest Private Logistics Real Estate Developments in Japan, Combined Investment Value over US$1 billion 
Tokyo, 25 March 2015 - The Redwood Group (“Redwood”), continued its rapid pace of expansion in the Japanese logistics real estate market with the announcement today of the closing and commencement of two new prime developments in greater Osaka, with a combined estimated completion value of over 120 billion Japanese Yen (over US$ 1 billion).
The two new distribution centers (DC), Redwood Nanko DC and Higashi Osaka DC, are strategically located in the bay area of Nanko Naka and inland at Fujiidera respectively, providing customers with excellent coverage to the greater Osaka market. 
Given the scale of the projects, Redwood is proud to partner with financial powerhouses Diamond Realty Management (a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation), Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank and Shinsei Bank as primary lenders.
The planned Redwood Nanko DC, will represent circa 250,000 m2 of Gross Floor Area (GFA) making it one of the largest logistics real estate developments in Japan.  Strategically located at the port of Osaka just 15-minutes drive from Osaka CBD and 40-minutes from Kansai International Airport, the two double-ramped distribution centers at Nanko are targeted for delivery in 2016 and 2018.  Redwood Higashi Osaka DC is designed as a 5-storey warehouse with a total GFA of over 150,000 m2.  Construction is to commence October 2015 and completion by end of 2016.  Its location at the confluence of the Meihan, Kinki and Hanshin highways provides excellent access to each of Osaka CBD, neighboring Kyoto, Nara, Wakayama and beyond to Nagoya.
As with all Redwood Japan projects, the construction design of both is set to best international practices, including highly efficient movement of goods with access for vehicles to each floor and a prioritization of safety and sustainability.  The developments will feature seismic resistant structures to the newest standards and back-up generators to ensure safety and security while providing business continuity to customers at all times.  With the environment as a priority, the facilities are to include water saving devices, energy efficient lighting and the installation of three of the larger rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) plants in Japan yielding a combined generation capacity up to a full 8 megawatts of clean energy for use in the metro area.
The Redwood senior management for over 15 years has been building prime distribution centers in Osaka, second only to Tokyo as the largest logistics market in Japan. With a population of circa 24 million and known as a major global manufacturing center of the electronic, machinery, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, greater Osaka has an estimated annual GDP of US$800 billion in one metropolitan area and has for centuries played a pivotal role both in Japan’s import/export and domestic distribution of goods. 
Charles de Portes and Stuart Gibson (President and CEO respectively), made this joint comment: "We are thrilled to announce these developments in Kansai of significant scale.  Each is carefully located and designed to service with efficiency, safety and environmental sensitivity the logistics needs of our domestic and international clients.” 
Japan Managing Director, Hideaki Matsunami and Business Development Director, Atsushi Maeda added: “Underlining the strong demand in the region, the vacancy rate for industrial and logistics properties in the Greater Osaka region is at an all-time low of 0.4% compared to Greater Tokyo of 3.8%, making it difficult for firms to find enough quality space to meet their needs.  Given the high visibility of both projects coupled with shortage of supply, we are honored that prospective tenants have been proactively contacting us about both locations.”
Redwood also commenced construction on its Chibakita DC, strategically located in Chiba Prefecture, one of the most important distribution regions in Greater Tokyo. The area is known for its industrial concentration and offers opportunities to meet rising demand for domestic distribution from both retail and e-commerce customers. The development project will have a gross floor area of 36,944 m2 built on a land site of 18,622 m2. The 4-storey build-to-suit facility for DAIWA Co. Ltd. is scheduled to be completed end March 2016.

This closing follows after PGGM’s additional capital commitment of US$144M on behalf of its PGGM Private Real Estate Fund last month into Redwood’s China Logistics Fund.

This compounded by the limited supply of the last years during and post the crisis has led to record high occupancy in the sector. We look forward to working with PGGM to further develop our Japan platform.” 
Ping Ip, Investment Manager for Japan with PGGM stated: “This investment fits well into the PGGM Private Real Estate Fund with its long term investment policy. We are pleased to continue to partner with the experienced and decisive manager, The Redwood Group, whose team has executed some of the highest quality distribution and logistics real estate developments and investments in Japan and elsewhere in Asia.

Redwood Inks Morgan Stanley AIP co-investment in China

Source: PERE Daily Digest – January 13, 2014
            (by Michelle Phillips)
The Redwood Group, the Singapore-based logistics fund manager, has inked a built-to-suit development deal with Morgan Stanley Alternate Investment Partners (AIP) Real Estate, the multi-manager platform of Morgan Stanley, as a co-investor. The deal represents Morgan Stanley AIP's first deal with Redwood in China.
The financial details of the deal were not disclosed, but PERE understands the total deal size to be between $50 million and $100 million, including debt. Redwood will act as the operating partner, and is building the 388,000 square foot facility for Daimler Northeast Asia Parts Trading and Services in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. Morgan Stanley has come in as a financial partner.
Construction for the first phase of development started last April, with completion expected by mid-2014. Daimler will also have the option of expanding with a second, 140,000 square foot warehouse later on, according to a Redwood statement.
This development represents Redwood's fifth investment in China, and means that Redwood has now fully committed all of the €95 million it raised in a first closing for its China fund. Redwood held that first close in June 2012, with a large commitment coming from Dutch pension fund PGGM. A second close on this fund is expected sometime in the first half of 2014 and Redwood is targeting approximately $400 million for the fund overall. The firm is also in the midst of raising a fund for Japanese logistics real estate.
The deal also represents one of Morgan Stanley AIP's first co-investment deals in Asia. At the end of 2012 the firm's co-head of real estate Paul Vosper said he saw particular opportunities in co-investments, but was willing to undertake such investments primarily in the US and the UK. In May, however, AIP hired Jon Sandstrom to head its Asian real estate team which enabled to platform's focus to expand.
Morgan Stanley AIP and Redwood declined to comment further than the statement.
Morgan Stanley AIP, currently manages $17 billion assets asset classes. It most recently launched a secondaries fund, the AIP Phoenix Global Real Estate Secondaries Fund II 2013, for which it has raised $48 million toward its $500 million goal so far, according to PERE's Research and Analytics division.

Shanghai, 30th December 2013 - The Redwood Group (Redwood) announced that it has entered into a 10-year lease agreement with Daimler for a custom built distribution facility in Guangzhou, China.

Charles de Portes and Oliver Treneman (Group President and MD of Redwood China respectively) issued a joint statement: “We are very excited about this agreement with Daimler, a recognized world leader in the automotive industry. Incorporating best practices of structural design, safety and efficiency into the project, the execution of this large-scale lease agreement demonstrates the demand for Redwood’s strategically located, modern logistics facilities and the confidence of major domestic and international clients. We are equally excited about what this project will contribute for years to come to the vibrant economy of Guangzhou, one of the largest and fastest growing metropolitan areas and centers of trade not only of the People’s Republic of China, but indeed, globally."
This project will serve as the main parts distribution hub for Daimler in Guangzhou, which is the main manufacturing hub of the Pearl River Delta, one of mainland China's leading commercial and manufacturing regions. Guangzhou, the capital and largest city of the Guangdong province is located on the Pearl River, about 120 km (75 mi) northwest of Hong Kong and is a key national transportation hub, trading port and southern China's largest city. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of over 12 million however estimates place the population of the entire Pearl River Delta Megalopolis including its surrounding municipalities and total built up area as high as 40 million.

Despite a high level of demand in the area, the supply of modern facilities in the submarket is scarce, with record low vacancy rates. The site and its planned high visibility and high specification distribution center will be well positioned to service long-term demand in the area with direct access to major thoroughfares servicing port, airport and truck transport for Yokohama, Tokyo and beyond."

Equity International and The Redwood Group Announce Strategic Partnership for Asian Logistics Real Estate
Transaction Expands Redwood's Platform Across Key Asian Markets

CHICAGO & SINGAPORE, August 21, 2013 – Equity International (EI), the privately held investment partner of leading real estate companies outside of the United States, and The Redwood Group (Redwood), a leading investor in and manager of real estate in Asia, announced today a strategic partnership for expansion of Redwood's warehouse and distribution property platform.
Redwood is an investment firm that creates value through the development, repositioning and management of real estate projects primarily in Asia's largest metropolitan areas. Redwood's founders, Charles de Portes and Stuart Gibson, pioneered this asset class in Asia in 1998 with the development of the first build-to-suit distribution hub for DHL, and the creation of the first private equity fund dedicated to Asian logistics real estate in 2002. Redwood's team has executed some of the highest quality distribution and logistics real estate developments and investments in the markets with greatest demand within China and Japan for numerous multinational clients.
"Redwood's institutional reputation, experienced team and strong relationship network make them an ideal platform for EI in Asia," said Tom Heneghan, EI's chief executive officer. "We are delighted to partner with Charles and Stuart as they develop and scale the Company's investments in Asian logistics property."
EI's investment will materially grow Redwood's capital base for rapid, disciplined investment into prime logistics and industrial locations across key Asian markets, with a primary focus on China and Japan. In addition, this partnership further expands the capabilities of the Redwood Japan and Redwood China Logistics Funds already in place with large global investors. The partnership will draw upon the market knowledge, China and Japan development experience and client relationships with many of the largest global and regional users of logistics space of the Redwood team.
Charles de Portes and Stuart Gibson, president and CEO of Redwood, respectively, issued a joint statement: "We are excited to build on our well-established relationship with Equity International. This combination of resources and reach will accelerate the expansion of our Asia platform and allow us to execute on our identified multi-billion US$ pipeline of prime location development projects in the region. We are looking forward to providing more high quality and efficiency logistics space for our clients in the major metropolitan markets of Japan and China that are tied closest to and expanding rapidly with global trade."
Redwood's target markets currently are under-supplied in the type of Class A product demanded by multinational tenants, which has resulted in pent-up demand for logistics space. This demand, coupled with the compelling growth characteristics in a region driven by the expansion of third-party logistics and e-commerce sectors, provide ongoing opportunity in the warehouse and distribution property sector. Redwood's investments will be driven primarily by customer demand for modern logistics facilities with quality specifications and the high through-put required by today's leading logistics operators, retailers, light manufacturers and automotive companies.

The Redwood Group announces the Acquisition of Prime Beijing Logistics Asset

Singapore, 18th July 2013 - The Redwood Group (Redwood) today announced that it has acquired a logistics distribution center in the prime location of Ma Ju Qiao Logistics Park, Tongzhou District, Beijing.
The project site is well located, at Xingmao No. 2 Road, Ma Ju Qiao Logistics Park, Tongzhou Logistics District, Beijing city (to the north of the sixth Ring road and to the east of Jing-Jin-Tang express way, with efficient access to and from these roads). The land area is approximately 4 hectares, with a building NRA of 24,071 m2. The property is currently leased to two well established, high profile domestic firms with a pan-China presence; Sino-Trans & Suning.
Tongzhou Logistics District is strategically located in Ma Ju Qiao town, southeast Beijing, connecting Beijing and Tianjin and is considered a class AAA logistics location. It is one of the three key logistics bases in Beijing, providing the city distribution to Beijing downtown, Tianjin and Tangshan city. Situated adjacent to the Beijing Development Area and the Beijing-Tianjin Expressway, 120km from the Tanggu new port of Tianjin and only 20km from Beijing Capital International Airport, the park has unique access to important sea, land and air logistic poles of the Beijing metropolitan area. Tongzhou Logistics Park is a highly competitive distribution sub-market due to the limited local land supply, coupled with ever increasing demand for city distribution service from Beijing city and Tianjin city. Many reputable logistics companies are located in the park including but not limited to Amazon, NYK, NEW EGG, Suning and others.
Charles de Portes and Oliver Treneman (Group President and MD of Redwood China respectively) issued a joint statement: "This acquisition provides the Redwood China Logistics Fund a direct presence in one of the most prime locations serving the Beijing and the Bohai Bay regions. With the restricted land supply in Tongzhou, low vacancy rates in the area and confidence of major domestic and international clients in the location, the site is well positioned to service long-term demand."

The leasing agreement is the first collaboration between Schenker-Seino and Redwood in Japan. The project is located with frontage to the Narita Expressway connecting Tokyo to the eastern manufacturing and distribution centers of Tokyo bay and to the Narita International Airport. The land site area for this class-A development project constitutes 16,400 square meters with a gross building floor area of 32,739 square meters.

The building is expected to earn a TAPA-A certification upon completion.
Herbert Wilhelm (President & CEO of Schenker-Seino Co., Ltd.) commented: "This ultra modern and environmentally exemplary building will help us to remain one of the premier logistics service providers in Japan. We very much look forward to having this facility as an addition to our already existing logistics centers for the benefit of our customers."

The Redwood Group Announces its New 32,739 m2 Development, Redwood Ichikawa Baraki with Significant Pre-leasing Activity

Tokyo, 1st March 2012 - The first project made public by RWG in Japan for 2012 anticipates a construction start in the summer of 2012.
The Redwood Group (Redwood) executed the binding Purchase & Sale Agreement for the land at Baraki, Ichikawa-City on March 1st for this class-A development project. The site area constitutes 16,400 m2 with a GFA of 32,739 m2. Redwood intends a construction start by August 2012 with a completion in July 2013.
Located in the high density logistics region adjacent to the junction of Tokando-Highway and Tokyo-Gaikan (ring road) Highway, the site is within 1km of the Ichikawa Interchange of Tokando-Highway.
The new warehouse will be 4 stories with an 8,000 m2 floor plate and ample parking including 30 truck berths on the ground floor, 11 additional truck parking spots and a spacious visitor parking lot. The building will be designed to be highly energy efficient and functional, with the highest standards of seismic engineering and environmental technologies.
Located only 13 minutes walking distance from the commuting train station, Futamata- Shinmachi Station of Kleiyo JR line and a large near-by residential community, the project provides easy access to a skilled labour pool.
Redwood has secured a Letter of Intent for roughly 2/3 of the lettable area from a global 3PL (third party logistics) company and before this announcement has already received strong indicative interest for the remaining lettable area. Redwood's senior staff expects the high profile project to be fully leased by the start of construction. The site is located directly facing the Narita Expressway, near the Tokyo Customs Air Cargo Office and with good proximity and access to both Narita and Haneda International Airports. Notably, in 2015, Tokyo Gaikan Hwy will be completed, providing easy access to Tohoku Hwy, Joban Hwy, and Kanetsu Hwy. The site will directly benefit from these transportation infrastructure improvements.

Oliver Treneman to Join as Managing Director & Country Head, for Redwood in the People's Republic of China

Singapore, 30 January, 2012 – The Redwood Group Asia Pte Ltd, (Redwood) announced today that Oliver Treneman will join as Managing Director and Country Head of Redwood in the People's Republic of China (PRC).

Such undersupply continues despite relative economic instability of major markets outside the PRC, due to the comparative nascence of the development industry for such product coupled with continued strong domestic economic growth. Improving the efficiency and quality of air, sea, and land cargo distribution facilities will contribute directly to improving the supply chain and global competitiveness of logistics in the country. We are looking forward to working with Oliver, with his strong experience developing the product in China for top international and domestic clients since the arrival a decade ago in the PRC of the first international developers of same. Oliver and his team will be diligent in provision of top quality customer service to our clients, working in partnership with them to increase the efficiency of their of their retail, manufacturing and logistics distribution platforms."
Oliver has over 15 years industrial and logistics real estate experience in the PRC. He has held the positions of Chief Operations Officer at Yupei Group (Logistics Real Estate), a JV with Equity International and country head for AMB Property Corporation (now ProLogis post merger in 2011), establishing and growing their presence in the PRC. Other former key positions include General Manager at Shanghai Business Park Development Co Ltd (JV) and Chief Representative at King Sturge & Co, Shanghai.
Oliver, a British national, holds a master's degree in Land Management from the University of Reading. Having spent two years studying mandarin at the Beijing Language & Culture University and Fudan University and a decade and a half of residence in Shanghai, he is also fluent in Mandarin Chinese.

PRESSURE TREATED

Pressure treatment is a process that forces chemical preservatives into
	 the wood. Wood is placed inside a closed cylinder, then vacuum and pressure
	 are applied to force the preservatives into the wood. The preservatives
	 help protect the wood from attack by termites, other insects, and fungal
	 decay. This material is great for retaining walls and fences that have
	 soil contact.
