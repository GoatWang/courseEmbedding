Indication
Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) is a prescription hormone medicine (progestin) used to lower the risk of preterm birth in women who are pregnant with one baby and who have delivered one baby too early (preterm) in the past. Makena was shown to work based on a lower number of women who delivered babies at less than 37 weeks of pregnancy. There are no studies showing Makena reduces the number of babies who have serious problems shortly after birth or who die. It is not known whether Makena is safe and effective in women who have other risk factors for preterm birth.



Important Safety Information for Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)
Makena should not be used in women with any of the following conditions: blood clots or other blood clotting problems, breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, or history of these conditions; unusual vaginal bleeding not related to your current pregnancy, yellowing of the skin due to liver problems during pregnancy, liver problems, including liver tumors, or uncontrolled high blood pressure.
Before you receive Makena, tell your healthcare provider if you have an allergy to hydroxyprogesterone caproate, castor oil, or any of the other ingredients in Makena; diabetes or prediabetes, epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma, heart problems, kidney problems, depression, or high blood pressure.
In a clinical study, certain complications or events associated with pregnancy occurred more often in women who received Makena. These included miscarriage (pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of pregnancy), stillbirth (fetal death occurring during or after the 20th week of pregnancy), hospital admission for preterm labor, preeclampsia (high blood pressure and too much protein in your urine), gestational hypertension (high blood pressure caused by pregnancy), gestational diabetes, and oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid levels).
Makena may cause serious side effects including blood clots, allergic reactions, depression, and yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes. Call your healthcare provider right away if you think you have symptoms of a blood clot (leg swelling, redness in your leg, a spot on your leg that is warm to touch, or leg pain that worsens when you bend your foot) or symptoms of an allergic reaction (hives, itching, or swelling of the face). The most common side effects of Makena include injection site reactions (pain, swelling, itching, bruising, or a hard bump), hives, itching, nausea, and diarrhea.
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

First and only FDA-approved medication that may help you stay pregnant longer1


Every week counts when you’re pregnant
Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection), pronounced Ma-keen-a, is an FDA-approved hormone medicine (progestin) prescribed to lower the risk of having a preterm baby in women1:

Who are pregnant with one baby, and
Who’ve unexpectedly delivered one baby too early (before 37 weeks) in the past

Makena is a weekly injection given (every 7 days) by your healthcare provider either at their office or in your home.1Learn more

Why choose FDA approved?
FDA-approved products, like Makena, provide greater assurance of quality and are held to high quality standards compared to products that are not approved by the FDA.
Learn why this is important 
FDA: Food and Drug Administration.











Every additional week makes a big difference for your baby





Your baby needs every week of pregnancy to develop.2-4 For example, your baby's brain and lungs are still developing in the last few weeks of pregnancy.4
In clinical studies, taking Makena significantly lowered the rate of preterm birth compared to moms who did not take Makena.1

Makena was studied in women who were at risk for having a preterm baby because they had given birth to a preterm baby before1
It’s not known whether Makena is safe and effective in women who have other risk factors for preterm birth1
Makena is not intended for use to stop active preterm labor1

Only your healthcare provider can prescribe FDA-approved Makena. Ask today if it’s right for you.

Kate gave birth to her son, Gabriel, 5 weeks early (35 weeks). When she became pregnant again with a single baby a year later, she learned she was at risk for another preterm birth and discussed Makena with her healthcare provider.





Benefits of using an FDA-approved medicine






Makena is the first and only FDA-approved medicine to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women who are currently pregnant with one baby and who have unexpectedly delivered a baby preterm (before 37 weeks) in the past.1
Makena is made in a facility that follows FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).5,6 Before it was approved, the FDA thoroughly reviewed the safety, efficacy, and manufacturing quality. This ensures quality of the product including5-7:

The right drug
The right amount of drug
Free of contamination
Sterile

The majority of drugs used in the United States are FDA approved and made under GMPs. Occasionally, due to a patient’s unique medical need, a pharmacist may need to compound an alternative formulation. Compounded drugs are not FDA approved and should only be prescribed when a patient has a medical need that can’t be met with the approved drug.8




Learn why FDA approval is importantSee more videos 
Understand the benefits of taking an FDA-approved medication
Jennifer Gudeman, PharmD, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Maternal Health, describes the FDA’s statement that FDA-approved medications should be used when medically appropriate rather than compounded formulations, unless there is a specific medical need for the patient.

What is preterm birth?

The goal of a healthy pregnancy is to deliver a baby at 40 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm birth is the delivery of a baby between 20 and 37 weeks.1-3

If you deliver a baby too early—before 37 weeks of pregnancy, or 3 weeks prior to the due date—this is known as preterm birth.1,4 Sometimes preterm births are unexpected or unplanned, though an early delivery may be necessary in some medical situations.1,4



You’re not alone.
In the US, 1 in 10 babies is born prematurely each year.2 That’s nearly 400,000 babies born too early.5





Preterm birth rates are different for different racial and ethnic groups.6





Preterm birth can happen to any pregnant woman.
Moms who’ve already delivered a baby too early (before 37 weeks)—regardless of the number of weeks early they've delivered—are at a higher risk for having another preterm birth.1,4,7

In most cases, healthcare providers don’t really know what causes a woman to experience preterm birth. But they do know that certain factors may make some women more at risk than others.4
Talk with your healthcare provider to make sure you are familiar with the risks associated with preterm birth. See what you can do to help reduce your risk.
Learn about how to support a healthy pregnancy. Read more 




Get the most out of your discussion with your healthcare provider 




Could you be at risk for preterm birth?





Below are risk factors for preterm birth.4 Please check the ones that apply to you and talk to your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or planning to get pregnant in the future.
The below checklist includes common risk factors for preterm birth.  Depending on your risk factor(s), Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) may not be right for you.
While there are many causes for preterm birth, the safety and benefits of Makena have been demonstrated only in women who’ve unexpectedly delivered their baby prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy. It’s not meant for use in women with multiple gestations or other risk factors for preterm birth.



Prior spontaneous (unexpected) preterm birth before 37 weeks
Pregnant with twins, triplets, or other multiples
Problems with the uterus or cervix
African American heritage
High blood pressure, stress, diabetes, or being overweight or underweight
Short time between pregnancies (6–18 months)
Certain infections during pregnancy such as an infection of the uterus, vagina, or urinary tract infection, or sexually transmitted disease
Smoking, drinking alcohol, or using illegal drugs




You've checked
1 or more
of these risk factors.


Now is the time to talk with your healthcare provider.
Start here








Steps you can take to reduce your risk of preterm birth





While there are no guarantees, you can still take steps to help reduce the chances of your baby being born prematurely. It’s important that you speak to your healthcare provider before you get pregnant and during your pregnancy about your risk for preterm birth, especially if you’ve delivered too early (less than 37 weeks) before.




Eat right
Eating healthy during pregnancy provides essential nutrients that you and your baby need. Ask your healthcare provider about which foods are good for you and your baby, and which foods you should avoid. You may also be instructed to take prenatal vitamins.4





Maintain a healthy lifestyle
Be sure to get enough rest and relaxation during your pregnancy, especially if you are feeling stressed. You may also need to make some lifestyle changes, such as avoiding smoking, alcohol, and drugs. Ask your healthcare provider about support programs that can help you quit.4





Talk to your healthcare provider
If you are at risk for having a preterm birth, talk to your healthcare provider about ways to help you stay pregnant until full term. There are potential treatments that may help give your baby the time needed to develop.

Healthcare provider discussion guide
Add To Home Screen
When talking about pregnancy with your healthcare provider, you want to make sure to get the most out of your visit. Here are some questions to help start a conversation about your prior preterm birth experience.
Select the questions you would like to discuss. Click “Print my guide,” then bring the questions to your next appointment.

I delivered a baby unexpectedly before 37 weeks. Could this happen again?
How can I reduce my risk and have a better chance for a full-term pregnancy?
How early could I go into labor?
What are some of the risk factors for preterm birth?
What are the signs and symptoms of preterm labor?
How does Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) work?
Is Makena safe for me and my baby?
Is Makena right for me?

While there are many causes for preterm birth, the safety and benefits of Makena have been demonstrated only in women who’ve unexpectedly delivered their baby prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy. It’s not meant for use in women with multiple gestations or other risk factors for preterm birth.
If you think you are at risk for a preterm birth due to a history of preterm birth, ask if FDA-approved Makena may be right for you.

Indication
Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) is a prescription hormone medicine (progestin) used to lower the risk of preterm birth in women who are pregnant with one baby and who have delivered one baby too early (preterm) in the past. Makena was shown to work based on a lower number of women who delivered babies at less than 37 weeks of pregnancy. There are no studies showing Makena reduces the number of babies who have serious problems shortly after birth or who die. It is not known whether Makena is safe and effective in women who have other risk factors for preterm birth.



Important Safety Information for Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)
Makena should not be used in women with any of the following conditions: blood clots or other blood clotting problems, breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, or history of these conditions; unusual vaginal bleeding not related to your current pregnancy, yellowing of the skin due to liver problems during pregnancy, liver problems, including liver tumors, or uncontrolled high blood pressure.
Before you receive Makena, tell your healthcare provider if you have an allergy to hydroxyprogesterone caproate, castor oil, or any of the other ingredients in Makena; diabetes or prediabetes, epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma, heart problems, kidney problems, depression, or high blood pressure.
In a clinical study, certain complications or events associated with pregnancy occurred more often in women who received Makena. These included miscarriage (pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of pregnancy), stillbirth (fetal death occurring during or after the 20th week of pregnancy), hospital admission for preterm labor, preeclampsia (high blood pressure and too much protein in your urine), gestational hypertension (high blood pressure caused by pregnancy), gestational diabetes, and oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid levels).
Makena may cause serious side effects including blood clots, allergic reactions, depression, and yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes. Call your healthcare provider right away if you think you have symptoms of a blood clot (leg swelling, redness in your leg, a spot on your leg that is warm to touch, or leg pain that worsens when you bend your foot) or symptoms of an allergic reaction (hives, itching, or swelling of the face). The most common side effects of Makena include injection site reactions (pain, swelling, itching, bruising, or a hard bump), hives, itching, nausea, and diarrhea.
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.
Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

First and only FDA-approved medication that may help you stay pregnant longer1


Every week counts when you’re pregnant
Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection), pronounced Ma-keen-a, is an FDA-approved hormone medicine (progestin) prescribed to lower the risk of having a preterm baby in women1:

Who are pregnant with one baby, and
Who’ve unexpectedly delivered one baby too early (before 37 weeks) in the past

Makena is a weekly injection given (every 7 days) by your healthcare provider either at their office or in your home.1Learn more

Why choose FDA approved?
FDA-approved products, like Makena, provide greater assurance of quality and are held to high quality standards compared to products that are not approved by the FDA.
Learn why this is important 
FDA: Food and Drug Administration.











Every additional week makes a big difference for your baby





Your baby needs every week of pregnancy to develop.2-4 For example, your baby's brain and lungs are still developing in the last few weeks of pregnancy.4
In clinical studies, taking Makena significantly lowered the rate of preterm birth compared to moms who did not take Makena.1

Makena was studied in women who were at risk for having a preterm baby because they had given birth to a preterm baby before1
It’s not known whether Makena is safe and effective in women who have other risk factors for preterm birth1
Makena is not intended for use to stop active preterm labor1

Only your healthcare provider can prescribe FDA-approved Makena. Ask today if it’s right for you.

After speaking with her doctor, Kate made a decision to start Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) because she was at risk for another preterm birth. Hear her story.
Kate gave birth to her son, Gabriel, 5 weeks early (35 weeks). When she became pregnant again with a single baby a year later, she learned she was at risk for another preterm birth and discussed Makena with her healthcare provider.





Benefits of using an FDA-approved medicine






Makena is the first and only FDA-approved medicine to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women who are currently pregnant with one baby and who have unexpectedly delivered a baby preterm (before 37 weeks) in the past.1
Makena is made in a facility that follows FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).5,6 Before it was approved, the FDA thoroughly reviewed the safety, efficacy, and manufacturing quality. This ensures quality of the product including5-7:

The right drug
The right amount of drug
Free of contamination
Sterile

The majority of drugs used in the United States are FDA approved and made under GMPs. Occasionally, due to a patient’s unique medical need, a pharmacist may need to compound an alternative formulation. Compounded drugs are not FDA approved and should only be prescribed when a patient has a medical need that can’t be met with the approved drug.8




Learn why FDA approval is importantSee more videos 
Understand the benefits of taking an FDA-approved medication
Jennifer Gudeman, PharmD, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Maternal Health, describes the FDA’s statement that FDA-approved medications should be used when medically appropriate rather than compounded formulations, unless there is a specific medical need for the patient.

Insights
In a world increasingly dominated by flows and momentum, uncovering investable secular themes becomes critical in generating superior returns for our clients.






Our “Insights” seek to identify actionable investment themes and carefully articulate the logic behind why such themes are important and how they should evolve over time.

Not Your Parents’ GDP Growth

	While real GDP growth is often considered a proxy for the forward progress in standards of living, shifting demographics (marked by aging, slower-growing populations) across the developed world require a rethinking of the long-held goal posts of absolute growth rates. Our latest Strategy Insights letter examines this reorientation, and probes the intergenerational consequences of a slower growth future.

Shell Game: A Case for Active Management in Light of New Policy Proposals

	The current proposals for a border adjustment tax (BAT) and disallowance of corporate interest expense deductions are being touted as boosters to the overall US economy. Our latest Strategy Insights letter explores how these policies will more likely represent a redistribution of wealth across sectors versus promoting any growth of the aggregate pie. With potentially large shifts in relative attractiveness across sectors, and more uncertainty than usual given the magnitude of proposed reforms, active management across sectors is poised to outperform.

Inflation: Reasonably Strong Fundamentals + Trump = Higher Future Inflation in the US

	With healthy underlying inflationary pressures in the US economy prior to the election, President Trump’s goal to reduce income inequality via the “confiscation” of assets that is implied by heightened inflation show the path for inflation may be even higher going forward. This represents a shift in the investing environment that few investors have experienced, the last inflation period dating from the 70s. As a result, a focus on real assets, currency, and domestically focused companies are likely important for return enhancement.

	Many promises were made on the campaign trail by both candidates but only Donald Trump’s intentions matter now. The country may be grappling with a more challenged income distribution landscape but will the campaign rhetoric of the President-Elect correct these issues that propelled him into the White House?

	For the last 5 years, the 60/40 has returned almost 9% annually with very low volatility thanks to negative correlation of bonds and stocks during this period. However, with near zero bond yields and languishing equity fundamentals, is reliance on that negative correlation for protection still a safe bet?

The Rate Hike: Deeper Dive into the Impact on Equities

A 100 bps instantaneous increase in the yield of 10-year treasury would lead to a 20% sell-off in the S&P 500, due to market participants essentially adjusting multiples in light of a new interest rate outlook.

Rates “Lift-Off”: How to Invest When History is No Longer a Guide

	The impact of a rate hike could certainly be a catalyst for an equity sell-off but without history as a guide we are left with only deductive reasoning, which typically only provides relatively vague forecast ranges. The days of a predictable policy path are now behind us as the Fed has gone to reacting to economic data as it comes out. How does the long term investor navigate these more volatile times?

The ECBs Quantitative Easing Program: The Only Option Left, but Will it Work?

	Many attempts at jump-starting the Eurozone economy and thereby generating inflation have left us with an alphabet soup of ECB policies: ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), NIRP (negative interest rate policy), OMT (outright monetary transactions), LTRO (long-term refinancing operations), asset purchase programs, etc. On January 22nd, the ECB announced its own QE program.

US Dollar Strength: What This Means for the Global Economy

	Since the beginning of the summer, the trade-weighted US dollar has appreciated approximately 8%, or over 35% on an annualized basis.

Lower Growth is Here to Stay: Expect Subdued Returns

	Lower Fed forecasts finally acknowledge a reality that is very hard to accept, that is the lower potential growth of the US economy, and indeed perhaps that of the global economy. Should growth be lower than historically was the case, then returns to capital will likely be lower as well.

Europe: A Lost Decade Ahead?

	The credit crunch under way now for five years in Europe may have already created permanent and irreversible damage to those economies. We ask the question: Is Europe on its way to a lost decade?

Wage, Income, Rates, Taxation, and Regulation: Why Growth Will Remain Below the Historical Trend

	The divergence between high and low earners explains why we see seemingly contradictory macro data: how can unemployment fall while real disposable household income remains unchanged? This is yet another headwind to growth in addition to increasing rates, increasing taxation and increasing regulation – all reasons why we believe long-term potential growth for the US will remain below the historic potential growth trend.

April 31, 2012: White Paper
The Road Ahead for China

	The Chinese growth “miracle” is enabled by a series of policies that purposefully distort input markets in order to facilitate industrial development. In order to transition to a consumer-led economy, China needs to dismantle the distortions it put into place that led to the Chinese growth boom. That is a tall order.

Strategy
We employ a disciplined approach to  strategic and tactical asset allocation to achieve broad, global diversification.






Founded by principals from leading North American endowments and foundations, we manage portfolios guided by the core tenets of the endowment model, designed to balance near-term payout needs with future growth objectives.
	We serve endowments and foundations, family offices, and pensions and financial institutions, with perpetual capital that is intended to fund future generations by maintaining an ongoing legacy through the protection of principal.  In pursuing this mission, we seek to create durable portfolios to achieve long-term growth with the preservation of capital for sustained performance.



Global Diversification. We invest across a full range of asset classes, geographies and strategies building highly diversified portfolios balancing risk and return.
	

Active Management. We access both exceptional managers and opportunities worldwide, often in illiquid and/or inefficient sectors.  We draw upon our long-standing industry relationships and asset class expertise in manager selection, oversight and opportunity structuring.
	

Alternative Investments. We have considerable experience in the alternative investment space through which we have established relationships with some of the most preeminent managers in the alternative investment business. We believe that alternative investments, which we define as talented global investors who target traditional and non-traditional asset classes, can deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and play an integral role in helping long-term investors achieve their investment goals.
	

Strategic Asset Allocation. We maintain a steady policy of strategic and tactical asset allocation supported by disciplined rebalancing. This enables our investment professionals to respond to market dynamics while remaining anchored to our long-term goals.
	

Benefits of Scale. We offer pooled investment vehicles that take advantage of our scale and long-term investment horizon, structured to provide each client access to our high-conviction managers in a risk-managed framework.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Indication
Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) is a prescription hormone medicine (progestin) used to lower the risk of preterm birth in women who are pregnant with one baby and who have delivered one baby too early (preterm) in the past. Makena was shown to work based on a lower number of women who delivered babies at less than 37 weeks of pregnancy. There are no studies showing Makena reduces the number of babies who have serious problems shortly after birth or who die. It is not known whether Makena is safe and effective in women who have other risk factors for preterm birth.



Important Safety Information for Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)
Makena should not be used in women with any of the following conditions: blood clots or other blood clotting problems, breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, or history of these conditions; unusual vaginal bleeding not related to your current pregnancy, yellowing of the skin due to liver problems during pregnancy, liver problems, including liver tumors, or uncontrolled high blood pressure.
Before you receive Makena, tell your healthcare provider if you have an allergy to hydroxyprogesterone caproate, castor oil, or any of the other ingredients in Makena; diabetes or prediabetes, epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma, heart problems, kidney problems, depression, or high blood pressure.
In a clinical study, certain complications or events associated with pregnancy occurred more often in women who received Makena. These included miscarriage (pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of pregnancy), stillbirth (fetal death occurring during or after the 20th week of pregnancy), hospital admission for preterm labor, preeclampsia (high blood pressure and too much protein in your urine), gestational hypertension (high blood pressure caused by pregnancy), gestational diabetes, and oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid levels).
Makena may cause serious side effects including blood clots, allergic reactions, depression, and yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes. Call your healthcare provider right away if you think you have symptoms of a blood clot (leg swelling, redness in your leg, a spot on your leg that is warm to touch, or leg pain that worsens when you bend your foot) or symptoms of an allergic reaction (hives, itching, or swelling of the face). The most common side effects of Makena include injection site reactions (pain, swelling, itching, bruising, or a hard bump), hives, itching, nausea, and diarrhea.
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

First and only FDA-approved medication that may help you stay pregnant longer1


Every week counts when you’re pregnant
Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection), pronounced Ma-keen-a, is an FDA-approved hormone medicine (progestin) prescribed to lower the risk of having a preterm baby in women1:

Who are pregnant with one baby, and
Who’ve unexpectedly delivered one baby too early (before 37 weeks) in the past

Makena is a weekly injection given (every 7 days) by your healthcare provider either at their office or in your home.1Learn more

Why choose FDA approved?
FDA-approved products, like Makena, provide greater assurance of quality and are held to high quality standards compared to products that are not approved by the FDA.
Learn why this is important 
FDA: Food and Drug Administration.











Every additional week makes a big difference for your baby





Your baby needs every week of pregnancy to develop.2-4 For example, your baby's brain and lungs are still developing in the last few weeks of pregnancy.4
In clinical studies, taking Makena significantly lowered the rate of preterm birth compared to moms who did not take Makena.1

Makena was studied in women who were at risk for having a preterm baby because they had given birth to a preterm baby before1
It’s not known whether Makena is safe and effective in women who have other risk factors for preterm birth1
Makena is not intended for use to stop active preterm labor1

Only your healthcare provider can prescribe FDA-approved Makena. Ask today if it’s right for you.

Kate gave birth to her son, Gabriel, 5 weeks early (35 weeks). When she became pregnant again with a single baby a year later, she learned she was at risk for another preterm birth and discussed Makena with her healthcare provider.





Benefits of using an FDA-approved medicine






Makena is the first and only FDA-approved medicine to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women who are currently pregnant with one baby and who have unexpectedly delivered a baby preterm (before 37 weeks) in the past.1
Makena is made in a facility that follows FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).5,6 Before it was approved, the FDA thoroughly reviewed the safety, efficacy, and manufacturing quality. This ensures quality of the product including5-7:

The right drug
The right amount of drug
Free of contamination
Sterile

The majority of drugs used in the United States are FDA approved and made under GMPs. Occasionally, due to a patient’s unique medical need, a pharmacist may need to compound an alternative formulation. Compounded drugs are not FDA approved and should only be prescribed when a patient has a medical need that can’t be met with the approved drug.8

Understand the benefits of taking an FDA-approved medication
Jennifer Gudeman, PharmD, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Maternal Health, describes the FDA’s statement that FDA-approved medications should be used when medically appropriate rather than compounded formulations, unless there is a specific medical need for the patient.

What is preterm birth?

The goal of a healthy pregnancy is to deliver a baby at 40 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm birth is the delivery of a baby between 20 and 37 weeks.1-3

If you deliver a baby too early—before 37 weeks of pregnancy, or 3 weeks prior to the due date—this is known as preterm birth.1,4 Sometimes preterm births are unexpected or unplanned, though an early delivery may be necessary in some medical situations.1,4



You’re not alone.
In the US, 1 in 10 babies is born prematurely each year.2 That’s nearly 400,000 babies born too early.5





Preterm birth rates are different for different racial and ethnic groups.6





Preterm birth can happen to any pregnant woman.
Moms who’ve already delivered a baby too early (before 37 weeks)—regardless of the number of weeks early they've delivered—are at a higher risk for having another preterm birth.1,4,7

In most cases, healthcare providers don’t really know what causes a woman to experience preterm birth. But they do know that certain factors may make some women more at risk than others.4
Talk with your healthcare provider to make sure you are familiar with the risks associated with preterm birth. See what you can do to help reduce your risk.
Learn about how to support a healthy pregnancy. Read more 




Get the most out of your discussion with your healthcare provider 




Could you be at risk for preterm birth?





Below are risk factors for preterm birth.4 Please check the ones that apply to you and talk to your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or planning to get pregnant in the future.
The below checklist includes common risk factors for preterm birth.  Depending on your risk factor(s), Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) may not be right for you.
While there are many causes for preterm birth, the safety and benefits of Makena have been demonstrated only in women who’ve unexpectedly delivered their baby prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy. It’s not meant for use in women with multiple gestations or other risk factors for preterm birth.



Prior spontaneous (unexpected) preterm birth before 37 weeks
Pregnant with twins, triplets, or other multiples
Problems with the uterus or cervix
African American heritage
High blood pressure, stress, diabetes, or being overweight or underweight
Short time between pregnancies (6–18 months)
Certain infections during pregnancy such as an infection of the uterus, vagina, or urinary tract infection, or sexually transmitted disease
Smoking, drinking alcohol, or using illegal drugs




You've checked
1 or more
of these risk factors.


Now is the time to talk with your healthcare provider.
Start here








Steps you can take to reduce your risk of preterm birth





While there are no guarantees, you can still take steps to help reduce the chances of your baby being born prematurely. It’s important that you speak to your healthcare provider before you get pregnant and during your pregnancy about your risk for preterm birth, especially if you’ve delivered too early (less than 37 weeks) before.




Eat right
Eating healthy during pregnancy provides essential nutrients that you and your baby need. Ask your healthcare provider about which foods are good for you and your baby, and which foods you should avoid. You may also be instructed to take prenatal vitamins.4





Maintain a healthy lifestyle
Be sure to get enough rest and relaxation during your pregnancy, especially if you are feeling stressed. You may also need to make some lifestyle changes, such as avoiding smoking, alcohol, and drugs. Ask your healthcare provider about support programs that can help you quit.4





Talk to your healthcare provider
If you are at risk for having a preterm birth, talk to your healthcare provider about ways to help you stay pregnant until full term. There are potential treatments that may help give your baby the time needed to develop.

Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) is a prescription hormone medicine (progestin) used to lower the risk of preterm birth in women who are pregnant with one baby and who have delivered one baby too early (preterm) in the past. Makena was shown to work based on a lower number of women who delivered babies at less than 37 weeks of pregnancy. There are no studies showing Makena reduces the number of babies who have serious problems shortly after birth or who die. It is not known whether Makena is safe and effective in women who have other risk factors for preterm birth.



Important Safety Information for Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)
Makena should not be used in women with any of the following conditions: blood clots or other blood clotting problems, breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, or history of these conditions; unusual vaginal bleeding not related to your current pregnancy, yellowing of the skin due to liver problems during pregnancy, liver problems, including liver tumors, or uncontrolled high blood pressure.
Before you receive Makena, tell your healthcare provider if you have an allergy to hydroxyprogesterone caproate, castor oil, or any of the other ingredients in Makena; diabetes or prediabetes, epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma, heart problems, kidney problems, depression, or high blood pressure.
In a clinical study, certain complications or events associated with pregnancy occurred more often in women who received Makena. These included miscarriage (pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of pregnancy), stillbirth (fetal death occurring during or after the 20th week of pregnancy), hospital admission for preterm labor, preeclampsia (high blood pressure and too much protein in your urine), gestational hypertension (high blood pressure caused by pregnancy), gestational diabetes, and oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid levels).
Makena may cause serious side effects including blood clots, allergic reactions, depression, and yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes. Call your healthcare provider right away if you think you have symptoms of a blood clot (leg swelling, redness in your leg, a spot on your leg that is warm to touch, or leg pain that worsens when you bend your foot) or symptoms of an allergic reaction (hives, itching, or swelling of the face). The most common side effects of Makena include injection site reactions (pain, swelling, itching, bruising, or a hard bump), hives, itching, nausea, and diarrhea.
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.
Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.
