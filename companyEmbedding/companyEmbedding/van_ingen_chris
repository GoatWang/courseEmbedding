About Joe Keegan
Dr. Keegan brings more than 30 years of experience managing high growth life science businesses.

ForteBio was acquired in 2012 by Pall Corporation. Previously, Dr. Keegan was the CEO of Molecular Devices (MDC). During his 9-year tenure at MDC, Dr. Keegan grew the company's revenue from $30 million to $185 million, at which point the company was sold to MDS, Inc. for $615 million. Prior to MDC, Dr. Keegan served as President of Worldwide Tissue Culture of Becton Dickinson and Vice President of Microscope and Scientific Instruments Division of Leica.  He currently serves on the Board of Directors of ALDA as Immediate Past Chairman, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Labcyte Corporation as Chairman, Response Biomedical Corp, Seahorse Bioscience Inc., Stereotaxis, Inc. and the San Francisco Opera. Dr. Keegan holds a B.A. in Chemistry from Boston University and a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Stanford University.
About Chris van Ingen
Mr. van Ingen has over two decades of senior management leadership experience and has served as an advisor to many life science companies.  Most recently as President of Agilent Technologies' Bio-Analytical Measurement business, he oversaw the growth of that business from $1 billion to over $2 billion in annual revenues in less than 6 years. Mr. van Ingen currently serves on the Board of Directors of Bruker EST, Inc., Accelrys, Inc., as Chairman, and Promega Corporation. In addition, Mr. van Ingen serves as a strategic consultant to several companies in the Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis instrumentation industry.  He previously served as a Director of Alpha Innotech Corporation and Symyx Technologies, Inc. until its merger with Accelrys in July 2010. Mr. van Ingen holds a B.S. degree in analytical chemistry.
About ProteinSimple
Our goal is simply to help researchers gain a better understanding of proteins and their role in disease.  We develop and commercialize proprietary systems and consumables for protein analysis that ultimately help reveal new insights into the true nature of proteins.  We believe that traditional protein analysis tools can be overly complex or inadequate, and our goal is to make protein analysis simpler, more quantitative and affordable.  Our comprehensive portfolio of tools includes Simple Western systems that provide fresh insight into protein expression and Biologics systems that probe the structure and purity of protein-based therapeutics.  We have over 180 employees, 14,000 systems installed around the world and our headquarters is in Santa Clara, California.  For more information, visit www.proteinsimple.com.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Margaret Hamburg, Stephen Ostroff

Feb 05, 2015

 



After serving as US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner for nearly six years, Margaret Hamburg is stepping step down from the post at the end of March. Stephen Ostroff will serve as acting commissioner after Hamburg's departure. Ostroff most recently served as the agency's chief scientist. During her tenure, Hamburg has been a strong proponent of personalized medicine and the agency approved new molecularly targeted drugs for lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and cystic fibrosis. The FDA also issued critical guidelines to help industry advance drugs alongside companion diagnostics that identify patients most likely to benefit from treatment. "We have ushered in the era of personalized medicine across all of our medical product centers," she said in a letter posted on the FDA's website announcing her resignation. "A growing percentage of our recent approvals have involved targeted therapies, offering many patients more effective response profiles and/or reduced likelihood of side effects."  The Personalized Medicine Coalition recently estimated that 20 percent of the new drugs that the agency approved last year involved a biomarker and applauded her dedication to the field. "Her commitment to personalized medicine was second to none," PMC President Edward Abrahams said in a statement. Under Hamburg's leadership, the FDA also released draft guidance on laboratory-developed tests last October. Although the move was highly controversial, Hamburg has stood by the agency's authority to regulate such tests and the need for added oversight as the practice of molecular medicine has grown rapidly. "It was under her leadership that the historic Medical Device User Fee Agreement III was struck, bringing significant new resources, accountability, and improvements to the device review process," the diagnostic industry group AdvaMed said in a statement. "In addition, she was a key advocate to strengthen oversight for certain laboratory-developed tests, which have become far more complex and critical to patient care and medical decision making."
