The #HereToCreate campaign is a series of 13 videos featuring female influencers across the world of sport culture. We get to share their insights on how creativity changed their game, their goals and their life. PS... These women are amazing.    www.adidas.com/us/heretocreate

Nike Training Club
The new Nike Training Club turns Nike master trainers and athletes (I pick Ronaldo) into your very own personal trainer - guiding and motivating you through every step of 100s of workouts.  Got the chance to touch every piece - UX, content, workouts, dynamic content, social and app store. This was a massive and amazing project. 






















































Lucy Activewear
Lucy was born for- and created by - amazing women. I got to team up with them on everything from seasonal launches to social to product on the web. This is a company that wants great things for women - making the best leggings on the planet was just the beginning. 


















































































































Nestle
Most people think frozen food is pretty soul-less food made by robots.  But Stouffer's still uses the original recipes Mrs. Stouffer's scrawled in her notebook over 70 years ago. Stouffer's is the good kind of old school.  They make food people truly crave and help get dinner on the table even on the busiest of days.  










































Travel Portland
Some people come to Portland on an adventure. And some people need a very sensible reason to come. Like a conference. We created Lego kits, trade show booths and interactive print ads to get the people who book those conferences to book those trips to PDX.









 

Travel Portland Direct Mail Campaign




























































adidas Boston Marathon
To get insanely serious runners ready for the Boston Marathon, adidas and Fleet Feet created a year-long training program. Called Boston365, the program took runners from day 1 to race day and included in-store, online, social and event elements. 










































Flipboard
A new site to launch new features. Clean and simple. 






























Vestas Wind Energy
Vestas is the biggest entity in the wind energy world. When they prepared to launch their new turbine, we created ways to tell their story to every audience they have - from an engineer to an investor to a guy who lives two towns over and wants to know more.  The Science of Certainty was a big umbrella theme, with lots of extensions. 
















































Oregon Lottery
We created an 8-bit game that challenges you to create perfect matches between holiday Scratch-its and the people in your world. There were two scenes to choose from - office or neighborhood - as well as hidden bonus point opportunities and a chance to win 200 tickets. Play the gam at holidayscratchits.com.


































































Oregon Community Credit Union
We helped a regional credit union make a big deal out something other financial institutions snubbed: being nice. Nice was who OCCU genuinely was- and we knew that was worth talking about - and worth switching banks for. 


































































PGE
Utility companies are required to run safety ads. But no one said they have to run boring safety ads. These print pieces remind us of a truth that's been around a good long while: safety is - and has always been - awesome.






























SaskTel












PeaceHealth
Breast cancer isn't the biggest threat to women's health. Heart disease is. In fact, 1 out 3 women will die from it. That's a huge truth many don't know - and this campaign encouraged every woman to tell a woman about the risk and signs.  


















Forest Film Festival
This campaign focused around a simple truth: filmmakers will do whatever it takes to get a movie shot.

Leah Henderson


Leah Henderson has always loved getting lost in stories. When she is not scribbling down her characters’ adventures, she is off on her own, exploring new spaces and places around the world. Many of the hopes, struggles, and traditions witnessed on her travels find a home in her work, hopefully offering added color and new perspectives to her characters’ lives. Leah received her MFA in creative writing from Spalding University and currently calls the Washington, DC, area home.

One Shadow on the Wall


By Leah HendersonBy Leah Henderson







PRAISE



"To read Leah Henderson's remarkable debut is to be utterly transported to a world that is at once mesmerizing, harrowing, and full of profound grace. Even as I rushed through this page-turner, I didn't want it to end; I wanted to bask in its evocative language, and fell completely in love with its loyal, clever hero. Give this to book to anyone who has ever struggled to decide between doing what is right, and what easy - namely, everyone."   
– I.W. Gregorio, author of None of the Above

Hi everyone and welcome back to my channel :)

Today I filmed a Drugstore Makeup Tutorial using a copper eyeshadow and a nude / orange lip. 

I also kind of did a First Impression on some of the products that I hadn't tried before and I was quite impressed with the makeup I tried. 

I wish I did put also eyelashes on but I didn't want to put any on that weren't drugstore even though the XOBeauty Lashes that I own aren't expensive. 

I hope you enjoyed this video , if you did don't forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE !!!

Thank you all and see you soon ,

Hello everyone and welcome back to my channel !

Today I have a GRWM on a makeup look that I would wear out to a party or out with some friends! I would usually wear fake eyelashes but I couldn't find my eye lash glue! 

I know I'm not a professional on makeup , the reason that I am attending a makeup course is to learn more tips and tricks so please excuse me if i have done something " wrong " in this video ! 

If you enjoyed this kind of video where I did a voice over then give it a THUMBS UP !!

♡ Thank you so much for watching ♡

Much Love ,

DISCLAIMER - I absolutely love working in hospo and love working for the company that I currently work for! Im not bagging on anyone I work with or the place I work at , its just some customers that I have had in the past that make my experience working in a restaurant / bar absolutely shit! I know everyone who works in any job has experienced horrible people and has picked up on some things that people do that annoy them so I thought I would just make a video on the things that annoy me!
