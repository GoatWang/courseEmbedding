10 Questions with TechShop
Playground for Creativity

TechShop isn't exaggerating when it calls itself a playground for creativity. Part hackerspace, fabrication studio and prototyping lab, people have been signing up for memberships to the workshop chain since 2006. There they gain access to training, expert advice and a broad range of professional grade equipment including sheet metal equipment, woodworking equipment, plastics working equipment, laser cutters, welding tools, hand tools, sewing machines, design software and much more.

Members can use the resources at TechShop to make just about anything they can imagine – and they have, including innovative new products that have launched new companies and changed lives.

In the last few years TechShop has grown dramatically and now has more than 6,000 active members nationwide.
Eight locations are now open across six states – California, Arizona, Texas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia – with another 2 locations under development and scheduled to open soon.

TechShop Vice President of Business Development and Chief Operating Officer Dan Woods took a break from his increasingly packed schedule to answer our burning questions about this expanding business.

Q: How has the increasing popularity of the Maker Movement impacted and influenced TechShop from a business perspective?

"From a business perspective, the growth of the Maker Movement has allowed TechShop to embrace economies of scale. As TechShop expands, we are able to invest more money in education content and tools. In addition, there is a fascinating scale with members.

With a smaller number of members, TechShop is mostly a place to access tools. But, as the membership grows, there is a critical point – around 500 members – where members start coming in because they want to experience the community and see their friends.

That is also the point where, as a business, we have enough members to hire a staff, do maintenance and make sure we can pay for health insurance."

Q: How does TechShop choose what type of equipment and tools will be available in a location?

"TechShop provides members access to just about every machine, tool and process that you can imagine, including milling machines and lathes, laser cutters, sheet metal equipment, welding equipment, woodworking equipment, plastics working equipment, hand tools, a 3D printer, computer-controlled vinyl cutter, sewing machines, design software and lots more. The exact number of each type of tool varies from shop to shop, based on the number of members and demand for each tool."



This 4'x8' CNC ShopBot router is one of three available in the woodworking area ofTechShop's Mid-Peninsula location in California. The ShopBot cuts parts, objects or art designedin 2D or 3D CAD and works with most woods, plastics, foams and other composites.


Q: How does TechShop choose which products to select from a large range with different functions?

"At the end of the day, we select equipment that allows us to meet the evolving needs of our members. One of our strengths is our ability to leverage the depth of experience of our 150 talented staff members, who help us identify advantages – and sometimes pitfalls – of certain equipment in the hands of makers with skills ranging from beginner to expert.


Obviously, when meeting the needs of more than 6,000 members, reliability, serviceability, availability and up-time are critical considerations. It's also important to note that our members' privileges extend across all of our locations, so we standardize machinery as much as possible."

Q: Could you share any stories of how TechShop positively impacted a community or an individual?

"There is a long list of stories about TechShop creating a platform for education, community development, learning and economic development. One of the most compelling stories is that of Marc Roth.

Marc was living in a homeless shelter in San Francisco when he found a business card for TechShop in a garbage can. He came in for a free tour and spent $49 on a one month membership and class deal we had at the time. He spent 10 to 12 hours a day studying the tools in the shop and quickly became an expert.

Within six months, Marc was supporting himself as a TechShop instructor and part-time helper for other members. Within 16 months, he had started SF Laser, making $75 an hour for production laser cutting and etching.

Now, Marc is developing a program to teach hands-on industrial-hardware skills to homeless individuals, and provide housing and volunteer mentors, called The Learning Shelter."

Q: Have there been any concerns or criticisms when a new TechShop location is proposed?

"We've seen a few hackerspaces and makerspaces who express some concern when they first learn that TechShop is planning to open a new location in their community. Initially, they see a new 18,000-square-foot workspace with $1 million worth of new machinery and tools as a threat. In reality, nothing is further from the truth.

The world needs more makerspaces, not fewer. We fill an important role in the makerspace landscape that no one else is doing on a global scale: we provide an open space where everyone is welcome regardless of skill level or background, access to a broad spectrum of leading edge tools and machinery, a community of helpful and spirited makers, and hundreds of classes taught every month by paid professionals."

Q: What would you like people to know about TechShop?

"TechShop is for more than just hobbyists and engineers. Anyone can come into TechShop and learn the skills they need to use tools and build what they want in a short period of time, even without any background knowledge."

Q: What is the biggest misconception about TechShop?

"We've had a tremendous amount of publicity around businesses that were launched around products developed at TechShop, such as Square. We're very much fueling the birth of new companies and jobs, but we want aspiring and novice makers to know that the majority of TechShop members are here because of their love of making. TechShop is filled with people from all walks of life who bring a richly diverse range of interests, skills and ideas."


Q: Can you mention any companies that have participated in TechShop's experience-driven corporate events?

"This is actually one of the fastest growing parts of TechShop's business. Whether it's classic one-day team building events, holiday parties or more intensive week-long innovation workshops, we hold hundreds of corporate and group events annually. Our clients include Google, Cisco, Nike, Apple, Intuit, Dell and dozens of other companies."


Q: Are there any community programs or fundraising efforts that TechShop supports?

"Sure, we have a partnership with Making It In America where we provide membership and training to underemployed and unemployed trade union members in Pennsylvania. We also have a program – generously sponsored by GE and the VA Center for Innovation – that provides membership and training to veterans. And, each of our locations provides workshop access and time to support deserving local school groups and other community causes."

Q: Why offer free coffee and popcorn, and is that at all locations, all the time?

"Yes, it is available at all locations at all times. It's important for our members to have a place and a snack to come together and chat over. TechShop is more than just tools, it is a community where makers can come together to share ideas and find inspiration."

With hundreds of members at each location, TechShop is in the process of expanding its franchise. Here's proof that the model can work.Jim Newton has close to 300 ideas that he would like to see realized. About five years ago, when that list seemed more manageable at only 200 items, Newton opened the first TechShop in Menlo Park, California. The idea was to empower other people to turn their one big idea into a reality. "I don't tinker as much as I thought I would," Newton recently told Newsweek, by way of explaining the ever-growing list, "but it's really rewarding to walk around and say, 'I empower this person to make this thing?'"For a membership fee of $125 per month (entry can also be purchased annually and discounts are available for students and family), TechShop's customers get access to hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of equipment, including sand blasting cabinets, pneumatic tools, band saws, sewing machines, milling machines, injection molders, laser cutters, welders and more. "The goal of TechShop is to provide members with every conceivable tool and machine that they would need to build, hack, fix or create just about any kind of project," according to the company's official website.There, in the safe confines of TechShop's space, where they are surrounded by others brimming with ideas and passion, the members can tinker with the high-end industrial gear and materials, piecing together prototypes for the Next Big Thing.But does it work? TechShop, with hundreds of members, is in the process of expanding. There are already three locations in the San Francisco Bay area and a fourth in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina. Over the next three years, Newton and his team plan on opening 20 additional shops, with a Detroit extension scheduled for later this year. They must be doing something right.While not everyone who purchases a membership to TechShop is going to create a hit product and bring it to market -- many of them aren't even trying to do that -- there have been a number of success stories to emerge from the franchise. We've collected seven different ones below:

Can John Kelly Stop the Chaos Inside Trump's West Wing?


David A. Graham




President Trump replaced his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, with the current secretary of Homeland Security, a retired Marine general.

Updated on July 28 at 5:57 p.m. ET
For once, the rumors of Reince Priebus’s demise were not exaggerated.
President Trump announced late Friday afternoon that he had named John Kelly as chief of staff, replacing Priebus. Priebus had been the subject of whispers of imminent dismissal more or less since he took the job, but the arrival of communications director Anthony Scaramucci last week, over Priebus’s objection, seems to have sped up his departure.
Trump announced the news via Twitter:

I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

...and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration

Bill Browder's Testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee


Rosie Gray




“I hope that my story will help you understand the methods of Russian operatives in Washington and how they use U.S. enablers to achieve major foreign policy goals without disclosing those interests,” Browder writes.

The financier Bill Browder has emerged as an unlikely central player in the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Sergei Magnitsky, an attorney Browder hired to investigate official corruption, died in Russian custody in 2009. Congress subsequently imposed sanctions on the officials it held responsible for his death, passing the Magnitsky Act in 2012. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government retaliated, among other ways, by suspending American adoptions of Russian children.
Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who secured a meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, was engaged in a campaign for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act, and raised the subject of adoptions in that meeting. That’s put the spotlight back on Browder’s long campaign for Kremlin accountability, and against corruption—a campaign whose success has irritated Putin and those around him.

The Limits of Bullying


Adam Serwer




Trump’s opponents have often been accused of naïveté for their appeals to norms and civility. But early Friday morning, at least, that faith was rewarded.

After Donald Trump implied Ted Cruz’s wife was ugly and accused his father of helping to kill President John F. Kennedy, Cruz still worked the phones for him. Trump humiliated “liddle” Marco Rubio, who endorsed Trump anyway. Trump implied Ben Carson was a child molester, and then appointed him to his cabinet. Trump ran a campaign in which he exhorted audiences to call for Hillary Clinton’s imprisonment, and she showed up to his inauguration. Trump rose to prominence by questioning whether the first black president was even American, and won the opportunity to destroy a huge part of that president’s legacy.
All of that made former First Lady Michelle Obama’s memorable line about going high when the other side goes low seem dangerously naive. Trump belittled, humiliated, threatened, and smeared his opponents (and sometimes his supporters) nearly every day since the beginning of his candidacy for president. His opponents appealed to precedent, to norms, to comity, and to decency. Today, Trump sits in the White House.

The 10 Challenges Republicans Now Face


David Frum




With efforts to repeal Obamacare collapsing, the GOP faces a difficult landscape as it looks ahead to 2018.

Here’s an after-action report, as Congress prepares to recess:
The signature Republican domestic-policy demand of the past seven years is dead again. Deader than ever. Brought down by Republicans themselves, in the face of nearly unanimously hostile public opinion.
Democratic constituencies have been mobilized to an intensity not seen since the worst days of the Iraq war. They have crowded town halls and barraged senators with phone calls and messages. The party’s serious internal differences—including over the future of health care—have been laid aside for the time.
Republican constituencies have been split and demoralized. Working- and middle-class Republicans have been put on notice: Their party wanted to cut their Medicaid and other health-care benefits. Why should they show up in November to vote for more of that?
Upmarket Republicans have been formally informed: Their party was duping them on Obamacare repeal, in all those years of yammering, it never developed anything like an alternative. The Obamacare taxes will remain in place, as will the law’s other costs and burdens. Why should they show up in November to vote for more of that?
The White House is melting down in recrimination, rage, and failure. While opponents condemn Trump as authoritarian and corrupt, supporters in Congress and media want to talk about almost anything else: Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, dirty rap lyrics—anything.
Donors are hearing that funds donated to the Republican National Committee and other party funds have been used to pay the personal legal bills of the supposedly super-rich Trump family—and that more such spending is probably on the way.
The special counsel’s investigation is triggering more and more erratic behavior from the president. Trump has repeatedly and publicly denounced his own attorney general—the one cabinet secretary executing a policy generally popular with the party’s conservative base, immigration enforcement. And this before the investigation has resulted in any legal consequences.
The president has achieved the lowest approval rating ever recorded for a chief executive at this point in his tenure, despite generally favorable economic news and the absence of any acute foreign-policy crisis.
The Democrats need take only 14 seats to flip the House. There are 7 Republican incumbents on the ballot in California, where the president’s approval rating has tumbled to 25 percent, down five points since Inauguration Day. There are 5 more in New Jersey, where Governor Chris Christie’s approval rating has plunged to 15 percent.
The 2018 Senate map favors Republicans, but the president has gone out of his way to tie the single most imperiled Republican incumbent, Nevada’s Dean Heller, tightly to him and to the unpopular health-care bill. The president is waging open war against Arizona’s Jeff Flake—and his approval rating has sunk below 50 percent in states that might otherwise have been thought of as pickup opportunities, including Missouri and Michigan.

How Long Can This Go On?


David A. Graham




One of Trump’s top aides viciously attacks the others, even as the president lambastes his own attorney general. Is there any limit on this administration’s dysfunction?

If Anthony Scaramucci is conducting an experiment in radical transparency at the White House, then things are going well. Otherwise, his tenure as communications director might not be off to a great start.
Thursday began with Scaramucci giving a preposterous interview to CNN—cutting off a segment with New Yorker journalist Ryan Lizza—in which he accused White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of leaking to the press, suggested he is trying to “save America from this president,” and likened his own relationship with Priebus to that of the biblical figure Cain and to Abel, the brother he slew.

The day closed with Lizza writing his own, devastating account of a deranged conversation he’d had with Scaramucci Wednesday night, after Lizza reported on a dinner Scaramucci had with Fox News personalities past and present. Politico had also published Scaramucci’s financial disclosure, obtained by a routine public-records request, but which Scaramucci was for some reason convinced had been leaked. (One fascinating lesson of Scaramucci’s appointment is how fast the debilitating paranoia of this White House can infect a new hire.)

Why the Myth of Meritocracy Hurts Kids of Color


Melinda D. Anderson




A new study finds that believing society is fair can lead disadvantaged adolescents to act out and engage in risky behavior.

Brighton Park is a predominantly Latino community on the southwest side of Chicago. It’s a neighborhood threatened by poverty, gang violence, ICE raids, and isolation—in a city where income, race, and zip code can determine access to jobs, schools, healthy food, and essential services. It is against this backdrop that the Chicago teacher Xian Franzinger Barrett arrived at the neighborhood’s elementary school in 2014.
Recognizing the vast economic and racial inequalities his students faced, he chose what some might consider a radical approach for his writing and social-studies classes, weaving in concepts such as racism, classism, oppression, and prejudice. Barrett said it was vital to reject the oft-perpetuated narrative that society is fair and equal to address students’ questions and concerns about their current conditions. And Brighton Elementary’s seventh- and eighth-graders quickly put the lessons to work—confronting the school board over inequitable funding, fighting to install a playground, and creating a classroom library focused on black and Latino authors.

John McCain Is Not Here to Be Your Hero


David A. Graham




The Arizona senator keeps confounding partisans on both sides who don’t understand that his alliances of convenience are rooted in his deep respect for Senate traditions.

The last two weeks have been an emotional roller coaster for many Americans, but it’s unlikely many of them can match John McCain’s experience.
About two weeks ago, the Arizona senator was diagnosed with a brain tumor after an operation to remove a blood clot in his head. Last Wednesday, that diagnosis became public. By Tuesday, he’d flown back in to Washington for a critical vote to open debate on an Obamacare repeal bill. First, he cast the decisive vote to proceed to the debate, handing Republican leadership a big win, and then he delivered an impassioned speech, taking Republican leaders (and the president) to task for their process on the bill.

John McCain's 'No' Vote Sinks Republicans' 'Skinny Repeal' Plan


Russell Berman




The Arizona veteran cast an unexpected vote against Mitch McConnell’s last-ditch proposal to partially repeal the Affordable Care Act, leaving the GOP once again without a way forward.

Senator John McCain brought down the latest Republican health-care plan early Friday morning.
In a moment of high drama on the Senate floor, the Arizona senator, stricken with brain cancer and railing against his party’s secretive legislative maneuvering, provided the decisive vote against Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s proposal to partially repeal the Affordable Care Act. The amendment fell, 51-49, thwarting once again the GOP’s longstanding efforts to deliver on a central campaign promise. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also voted against the bill, continuing their opposition to the GOP’s partisan repeal effort. But it was McCain who surprised the Senate, breaking with his party after earlier helping it on a key procedural vote.

The Four-Letter Code to Selling Just About Anything


Derek Thompson




What makes things cool?

Several decades before he became the father of industrial design, Raymond Loewy boarded the SS France in 1919 to sail across the Atlantic from his devastated continent to the United States. The influenza pandemic had taken his mother and father, and his service in the French army was over. At the age of 25, Loewy was looking to start fresh in New York, perhaps, he thought, as an electrical engineer. When he reached Manhattan, his older brother Maximilian picked him up in a taxi. They drove straight to 120 Broadway, one of New York City’s largest neoclassical skyscrapers, with two connected towers that ascended from a shared base like a giant tuning fork. Loewy rode the elevator to the observatory platform, 40 stories up, and looked out across the island.

What Can Trump Do About MS-13?


J. Weston Phippen




In a graphic speech Friday, the president threatened to track down and deport gang members in the United States. But the administration’s overall strategy isn’t clear.

President Trump flew to New York Friday to talk about “liberating” Long Island from MS-13. Trump has often used the gang, its bloody tactics, and its ties to Central America to push his immigration policies, and the picture he painted Friday was one of Long Island as a war zone.
MS-13, Trump said, has “transformed peaceful parks and beautiful, quiet neighborhoods into blood-stained killing fields.” He said the gang members “stomp on their victims,” “slash at them with machetes,” and stab them with knives. To “every gang member and criminal alien,” Trump threatened, “we will find you, arrest you, we will jail you, and we will deport you.”
In the past 18 months, the gang has been implicated in 17 murders in Long Island. It’s also made gory headlines in Maryland and Northern Virginia, all of which are home to large Central American populations. But while MS-13 is indeed dangerous, as I wrote last month, law enforcement often disagrees with the president on how the gang should be handled. In the United States, MS-13 is seen largely as a domestic law-and-order issue, like other gangs are—and one that deportation won’t solve.

NYCEDC Selects Industry Leader Techshop To Operate Advanced Manufacturing Center In Sunset Park 


October 06, 2016 

Expected to Support More Than 200 Businesses, Create Over 500 Jobs Center is Cornerstone of the Futureworks NYC Advanced Manufacturing Initiative, Key Component of Mayor de Blasio’s Industrial PolicyNYCEDC today announced that industry leader TechShop has been selected to operate a more than 15,000 square foot advanced manufacturing center at the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park. This shared workspace will provide makers and other small manufacturing firms with affordable access to 21st century equipment, as well as access to a suite of support services.The advanced manufacturing center is the cornerstone of Futureworks NYC, a network of programs and resources to support the advanced manufacturing sector in New York City, create high-skilled production jobs, and increase competitiveness for existing manufacturing companies. The new center is expected to create more than 500 jobs in the first 5 years, attract $200 million in investment, and help launch more than 200 new industrial businesses.TechShop – the largest and most experienced operator of open-access makerspaces in the world – has helped launch hundreds of businesses responsible for thousands of jobs, and with a combined worth over $6 billion. TechShop currently operates in 12 cities worldwide: San Jose, Redwood City, San Francisco, Phoenix, Detroit, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Austin, Washington D.C., Paris, Abu Dhabi, and Tokyo.“We launched Futureworks to ensure the greatest city in the world remains the greatest place to make things and to grow a 21st century industrial business,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio. “This advanced manufacturing center is the linchpin of our Futureworks initiatives, and we couldn't be more excited that TechShop is bringing their global experience and expertise to make sure it's a tremendous success.”“We are experiencing a manufacturing renaissance in New York City that is driven by the talents of our creative entrepreneurs, makers, and inventors,” said NYCEDC President Maria Torres-Springer. “Our new partnership with Tech Shop will democratize access to the state of the art tools, equipment, and workspaces necessary to not just support our city's manufacturers but also position New York City at the forefront of advancing manufacturing.”“We are thrilled to be bringing TechShop to New York City,” said Dan Woods, CEO of TechShop. “TechShop’s vast experience in safely and effectively managing  world-renowned makerspaces will enable Futureworks NYC to fuel the birth of new products, companies and jobs and to deliver transformational experiences to the people and communities of Brooklyn.”“This is another important step to expand opportunities in Sunset Park’s industrial sector, creating good paying local jobs,” Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez.  “I’m excited that TechShop will be bringing additional resources to help further fuel economic activity in our community.”“I am proud Sunset Park's Brooklyn Army Terminal is a cornerstone of New York City's advanced manufacturing revolution,” said Council Member Carlos Menchaca. Our protection of manufacturing zones and our investments in infrastructure must be coupled with innovative business practices. I am especially pleased to see FutureworksNYC include direct grants for start-ups along with practical assistance for existing manufacturers. To succeed at BAT, the innovators who will build New York's advanced manufacturing future need Sunset Park's skilled labor. The FutureworksNYC initiative provides resources for a proven industry leader like TechShop to support growth, and workforce development. I will judge the value delivered by FutureworksNYC by both economic impact and to what extent local workers share the benefits of growth.”“SBIDC is excited and proud to welcome TechShop and the Advance Manufacturing Center to Southwest Brooklyn,” said David D. Meade, Executive Director of the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation.  “The manufacturing sector is critical to the Southwest Brooklyn economy, and the economy of New York City as a whole, and we are happy to see the City making a major investment in the future of manufacturing, right here in our neighborhood.  As the organization working closely with Southwest Brooklyn’s industrial sector, we look forward to working with the new tenants of the Advance Manufacturing Center, and helping to create good jobs for local residents.”“Brooklyn’s waterfront is already one of the leading innovation corridors in the country, and TechShop will be an incredible addition,” said Carlo A. Scissura, President and CEO, Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. “Providing companies with space and access to the best equipment for a fraction of the cost will further enhance the environment of creativity and advanced manufacturing that is thriving in Sunset Park. Congratulations to Mayor Bill de Blasio, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen and NYCEDC President Maria Torres-Springer.”In addition to the advanced manufacturing center, other components of Futureworks NYC include:Virtual Incubator: Services to support the launch of product start-ups in the City and to encourage local production and supply chains as they scale. Business Extension Services: Services to provide assistance helping traditional manufacturing firms learn about and adopt new technology.Existing Space Activation: Services through partnerships with existing research, prototyping and fabrication, and production facilities to expand their capacity to broaden access to equipment to users such as start-ups, manufacturers and entrepreneurs.Futureworks Growth Initiative: Grants that offset costs for advanced manufacturing startups establishing new operations.Advisory Body:  Thought-leaders, manufacturers and entrepreneurs who actively contribute to the direction and momentum of the overall initiative.Futureworks.nyc: A digital resource connecting the dots on New York City’s services, spaces and events dedicated to advanced manufacturing.Futureworks NYC was first announced in November of 2015 as part of Mayor de Blasio and Speaker Mark-Viverito’s ten-point action plan to grow industrial and manufacturing jobs. The City’s action plan for the industry will help ensure that both longstanding businesses and new firms have the space to evolve and expand, preserving and creating good jobs in New York City.The new and current investments will generate more than 20,000 new jobs and support the city’s existing 530,000 manufacturing and industrial jobs, which represent 15.4 percent of the city’s private sector workforce. The sector is an important pathway to the middle class for many families, with median wages of $50,400 a year. In addition, more than 328,000 jobs in the sector (61.5 percent) are located outside Manhattan, 62 percent of the workforce comes from culturally diverse backgrounds, and nearly half are foreign-born.
