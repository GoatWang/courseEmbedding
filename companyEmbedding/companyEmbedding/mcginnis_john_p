(BW) John P. McGinnis Named Senior Vice President of Seneca Resources


Business Editors, (c) 2007 Business Wire


        Published 1:05 pm, Thursday, March 8, 2007
    



































































HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Seneca Resources Corporation ("Seneca"), the Exploration and Production subsidiary of National Fuel Gas Company (NYSE: NFG), announced today that John P. McGinnis has been named Senior Vice President, Exploration and Development.
"We are pleased to welcome John to the Company," said David F. Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer of National Fuel Gas Company. "Adding John to our management team at Seneca further underscores our commitment to develop and extract value from our Appalachian holdings. Like Matt Cabell, Senecaâ€™s recently-named President, John possesses technical expertise and industry experience that will strongly contribute to our Appalachian growth plan," Smith added.

McGinnis has 22 years experience in oil and gas exploration, including his most recent position as General Manager, Exploration and Production (Eastern U.S.) for Dominion Resources, where he was responsible for leading the business unit's strategy to explore for reserves in Appalachia and other Eastern U.S. regions.
"John's extensive experience will help Seneca to achieve the long-term objectives of increasing reserves and reducing finding costs," said Matt Cabell, President of Seneca.* "In particular, John will help to execute a comprehensive growth plan for our Appalachian properties, while also providing day-to-day oversight of the overall exploration program.* Barry McMahan will continue in his current role as Senior Vice President, Production and Operations, helping Seneca to maintain our position as an efficient low-cost producer."*
Prior to his employment at Dominion Resources, McGinnis was Vice President of Exploration for Nuevo Energy and Division Explorationist for Amerada Hess Corporation. He holds a PhD in Marine Geology and Geophysics from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and both a Masters degree and a Bachelor of Science degree in Geophysics from Purdue University. McGinnis and his wife, Lana, reside in Houston, Texas, with their two children.
National Fuel Gas Company is an integrated energy company with $3.8 billion in assets comprising five principal operating segments: Utility, Pipeline and Storage, Exploration and Production, Energy Marketing, and Timber.
