HOW WE BECAME THE BROKER DEALER OF CHOICE FOR HIGH INTEGRITY FINANCIAL FIRMS

 
It was 1963. A young entrepreneur named Larry S. Rybka was starting a business that would one day become Valmark Financial Group. During the final interview with the president of a life insurance company, he was given a marble with the Golden Rule inscribed across its equator, along with this advice:
“Keep this marble in your pocket always. Every time you have a difficult decision to make, think about the Golden Rule and I know it will guide you to the right decision.”
Over the course of half a century and three generations, the Golden Rule Marble has been passed from father to son within Valmark. Likewise, one is presented to every new Member Firm advisor as they become part of the Valmark family of firms. It has become a touchstone and guiding principle in all of our practices:

Serving as an industry model for relationships built on trust and mutual respect
Addressing the financial needs of our independent Member Firms and their high net worth clients with innovative, collaborative solutions
Safeguarding Members’ and Clients’ best interests at all times

“Why am I more confident about Valmark today than ever? Because I’ve seen their management team respond over the past 50 years to previous industry upheavals and paradigm shifts. They don’t just weather these storms. They always approach change by asking, ‘How can we position our Member Firms to benefit from what’s next?’ That underlies every decision they make, so I know they always have my back.”

OUR APPROACH TO CHANGE
A Stable Foundation of Continuity You Can Build Your Business On
 
More than a provider of financial instruments and products, we’re at our best when navigating change and helping you prosper in the midst of upheaval. Our prime focus is supporting the autonomy of our independent Member Firms. It’s why we’re always listening and working to solve your most pressing needs.
Our Members enjoy personal attention and even tight friendships, backed by the support of global resources and some of the brightest minds in the industry. We’re here to share our collective wisdom and industry experience, all while anticipating and preparing you for what’s next.
 
 
 
 




 
 
 



MAKING A DIFFERENCE
 
 
 


While ValMark Members are distinguished by the professionalism with which they serve their clients, they are also leaders who choose to make a difference in their communities and for those less fortunate in other corners of the world. Their passion to live their lives with purpose and meaning permeates their relationships with their families, friends and clients. And it extends to causes dear to their hearts.
For this reason, we created the ValMark Global Gift Fund which has awarded almost $3 million in grants to support the charitable work of our Member Firms. The work of the Global Gift Fund also extends to hands-on assistance to homeless shelters, schools for the disadvantaged, and annual service trips.
Recognizing that the heart knows no borders, these annual service trips include overseas projects like the Westhaven Children’s Home in Hanover, Jamaica, and working with the community of Boneza in Rwanda to create the area’s only high school.
 
 

Members are often joined by their children and grandchildren on these life-changing trips to learn that they are here for a purpose, and to experience the joy of sharing their blessings with others.

Services
The Best of All Worlds
 
 
 


For three generations, Valmark Financial Group has been at the forefront of the financial services industry, working exclusively with successful entrepreneurial wealth transfer and wealth management firms to meet the unique and changing needs of clients.
 
 

Most notably, in 1996, Valmark merged a high-end life insurance “producer group” with all-encompassing securities and investment advisory services in order to better serve our Member Firms and their clients.
 
 
 
 



A HOLISTIC APPROACH IN ALL 50 STATES
Today, we are a national, independent broker-dealer licensed in 50 states for life insurance and securities with corporate offices in Akron, Ohio and St. Paul, Minnesota. The various entities that comprise Valmark Financial Group specialize in providing equity, investment advisory, risk management, and qualified retirement plan products and support services for the industry’s top tier of wealth advisors.
 
 
 

Our approach to holistic financial planning is based on our unique combination of offerings from two fee-based planning SEC Registered Investment Advisory Firms, a FINRA Registered Securities Broker-Dealer, a Master General Insurance Agency/producer group and our Policy Management Company. This combination gives our Members the ability to selectively utilize offerings from each entity and uniquely tailor financial solutions to their individual client needs.

 
 
 


SUSTAINABLE GROWTH MADE POSSIBLE BY AN AGILE A-TEAM MEMBERSHIP
Being privately-held and boutique in nature requires a nimble and long-term strategy for sustainable growth. This makes us highly selective about the quality and number of firms we invite to join as Members. By design, we maintain a membership of 115 independently-owned Member Firms throughout the U.S. Our exclusive membership provides a breeding ground for success as we partner with our Members to build turnkey processes designed to streamline their businesses and make them more efficient, scalable and prosperous.

“One of Valmark’s many strengths are their people. They have built a vibrant, competent young workforce who are super motivated, MBAs that are smart as a whip. It’s a very energetic and contemporary organization with brains. After spending a day walking around their headquarters, we realized, ‘These are my kind of people!’”

THE ENGINE THAT PROPELS THE VALMARK COMPANIES
Comprehensive Support From Top Industry Professionals
 
Our commitment to excellence results in a culture oriented to helping Member Firms reach their potential and capitalize on changes in the marketplace. With impeccable follow-through, we provide this assistance through concierge-level service provided by a distinguished professional services team of 100+ individuals, one of the highest staff-to-producer ratios in the industry.
With credentials spanning multiple financial disciplines—from legal, accounting, tax and financial advisory expertise to life insurance, retirement planning and securities—the Valmark team serves as a back office support staff for Member Offices, enabling them to offer their clients a comprehensive array of services provided by some of the brightest minds in our business.
 
 
 
 



A Personal Relationship Means “You First”
 
The relationship your firm enjoys as a Valmark Member is tailored to YOUR strengths, YOUR goals, and YOUR business. Our flexibility is how you know we respect your expertise.
While many broker dealers may offer a wide range of products and services, their idea of “value added” often means giving you a list of “800 numbers”. At Valmark, you receive a dedicated team of internal professionals who provide integrated support for both your insurance and investment business through a central source. With one phone call, your internal team can coordinate all aspects of your case or inquiry – including technical and marketing support, case design, provider questions, software and online support, underwriting, compliance, client service and more.
 
 

HIGH TOUCH MEANS HIGH RETENTION
 
What is also indicative of the high value we place on our relationships with our Members is our turnover rate of only 1%, which is one tenth of that experienced by other independent broker-dealers.
Today, our average Member Firm generates approximately five times the total revenue that they did two decades ago. This is a strong testament to the sound and collaborative relationships we have built with our Firms, the continued alignment we have with our Members and their clients, and our steadfast commitment to staying flexible and ahead of changes taking place in our industry.

This material must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus, which outlines specific charges and expenses associated with the product, a hypothetical illustration showing the effect on performance of various assumptions regarding the cost of insurance protection, among other important information. Individuals may also obtain a personalized illustration of historical performance, which reflects the cost of the individual’s policy insurance protection. Please review this material with a current variable annuity prospectus, product material (product brochure or illustration) and the current monthly performance for the specific product.
TOPS® ETF Portfolios assess fees and expenses that are separate and distinct from each respective underlying insurance contract or fund option.
Please read the product and fund prospectuses carefully before you invest or send money. Investors should consider the investment objectives, strategies, risk factors, charges and expenses of the underlying variable portfolios carefully before investing. The fund prospectus contains this and other information about the underlying variable portfolios.
There is the risk that you could lose money through your investment in the portfolios. Many factors affect the portfolios’ net asset value and performance. The portfolios may be subject to credit risk where issuers might not make payments on debt securities, resulting in losses. By investing in ETFs, the cost of investing in a portfolio will be higher than the cost of investing directly in the ETFs and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in stocks and bonds. Foreign investing involves risks not typically associated with U.S. investments, including adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values, adverse political, social and economic developments, less liquidity, greater volatility, less developed or less efficient trading markets, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards. Foreign equity securities denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies will subject a portfolio to currency trading risks that include market risk and country risk. It is possible to lose money by investing in securities.
The portfolio’s positions in lower-quality bonds, known as “high yield” or “junk” bonds, present greater risk than bonds of higher quality, including an increased risk of default. The portfolios’ exposure to companies primarily engaged in the natural resource markets may subject a portfolio to greater volatility than the securities market as a whole. Natural resource companies are affected by commodity price volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs, and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Positions in small or medium capitalization company stocks may subject the portfolios to additional risk since they are subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than those of larger, more established companies.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and  expenses of the TOPS® ETF Portfolios. This and other important information about the portfolios are contained in the prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-855-572-5945. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. The TOPS® ETF Portfolios are managed by ValMark Advisers, Inc. and distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, member FINRA/SIPC. Northern Lights Distributors, LLC is not affiliated with ValMark Advisers, Inc. or Milliman, Inc.
