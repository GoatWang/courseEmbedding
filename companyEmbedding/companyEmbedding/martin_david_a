Product Description▼▲
This bold work challenges two popular conceptions of religion---as either the instigator of conflict or the propagator of peace. Martin, one of the world's leading sociologists of religion, rejects both as oversimplifications, and draws on case studies from Britain, the US, Latin American, and Romania to argue for a more nuanced, complex approach that takes account of the role of national and ethnic identity.

WIDGET PRESS RELEASES




Tapping the Global Markets
Black Enterprise magazine
David Martin was cooking up what was perhaps the meal of his life.
Inside an Atlanta hotel, the president and CEO of Home Style Foods L.L.C. wanted to impress a delegation of Brazilian business people brought to the U.S. in 2008 to identify American producers of food products. Home Style Foods, an Atlanta-based processor and distributor of turkey, pork, and chicken sausages, has had a local following since the business opened in the mid-1990s, but Martin felt the best way to take the business to the next stage was to look beyond the U.S. shores.

Get Your Goat
Flavors magazine
Through his company Gotcha Goat, LLC, local entrepreneur David Martin hopes to grab the global goat market by the tail. For the past six years, Martin, along with partners Bruce Dobbs and Frances Martin, has been working with Tuskegee University, Fort Valley State University, local farmers, state and federal politicians, and USDA representatives to develop the only branded goat meat effort in the country.

Meating a Demand
Focus magazine
If you go grocery shopping at your local Kroger store, and have the taste for goat meat, there is a chance some of those cuts may have a "Wildcat" taste.
It is because Fort Valley State University's Meat Technology Center has developed a partnership with the Gotcha Goat company based in Ellenwood, Ga.

Featured Article
Goat Meat: The kids are all right
The Economist Magazine
IF YOU buy a goat from your friendly local halal butcher, he will leave the heart, liver and kidneys attached. Offal spoils quickly; if it passes the sniff test, the meat is good.

Few Americans want to take that chance. Ask a typical American what he thinks of goat and he’ll imagine “a gnarly-looking old billy goat with long horns on top of a car chewing on an old tin can,” says J.J. Jones, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University. Some may believe it has a gamy flavour. This is true of older goats, but a young cabrito has a clean, grassy, herbal flavour, sweeter and less greasy than beef. It also boasts fewer calories and less cholesterol than beef, chicken, pork or lamb.

Bermuda is a “nutter” world
The Royal Gazette Online
“Bermuda is another world” or so go the lyrics to the Island’s unofficial national anthem. Or is it: “Bermuda is a nutter world”? According to some new cleverly packaged peanuts promoting Bermuda, it’s the latter.

The tongue-and-cheek. ten-ounce tins of nuts come adorned with labels that look like vintage Bermuda postage stamps and say “A Nutter World” over a picture of the Islands laid out in legumes. Ink stamped on it is the flavour, which states Salted or Island Fever Hot ‘n Spicy Blend.  Read More


Entrepreneur of the Week: Home Style Foods Reaches Beyond U.S. Borders
Cascade Patch
For more than a decade, Home Style Foods have provided its loyal customers with quality smoked sausages. Now it plans to diversify and expand beyond U.S. soil.
David Martin wanted a product he could sell.

After working years as a corporate and real estate attorney, Martin chose to bite into the multi-billion dollar meat market.

THE ART OF
SAUSAGE MAKING
Georgia Trend
CONSIDER THE WONDROUS SAUSAGE BISCUIT: A THING OF SIMPLE BEAUTY,
with browned bits of spiced pork between fresh-baked bread. Those of us who are old
enough, and came from an agrarian background, remember when it was a part of a much
larger breakfast – every single day, with eggs and juice and coffee and jam. Farm-style eating is
hard to kick, even when you’ve transitioned into a white-collar world – but it quickly catches up
when you’re no longer plowing the north 40 after sunup.

Featured Article
Getting Goat Meat to a Clamorous Public
Atlanta Magazine
You may not be aware of it, but the demand for goat meat in this country far exceeds the supply.

As ethnic populations in the United States grow—and as the traditionally bland American palate grows more adventurous—interest in this global staple has grown too. The most widely consumed meat in the world, goat (aka cabrito, capretto, chevon) holds a place of honor in many cuisines, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Jamaican, Greek, and Persian. Problem is, there’s not much of it available in the United States. Most goat meat sold here is imported, frozen, from Australia and New Zealand. Americans who raise goats—for show, dairy or meat—are accustomed to calls from consumers in search live animals for slaughter. - See more at:

Shop Online for Sunglasses
A pair of sunglasses not only makes you look good, but also protects your eyes from the harmful UV rays. Look for polarised sunglasses, or ones offering UV protection to enjoy being outdoors during the day. Most sunglasses use glare-free technology which reduces stress on your eyes. Such sunglasses are even useful for sportspersons who are on the field all day. Some basic colours available are black, grey, and brown. Those on the lookout for something different can select colours like blue, green, purple, pink, and others. Here, you have a number of options when it comes to frame shapes as well.
Sunglasses for All
The exhaustive collection of eyewear includes trendy unisex sunglasses too. Choose a pair depending on the occasion. You can consider sporty shades to add to your style quotient. Wayfarer sunglasses, aviator sunglasses, sports sunglasses, and more are some other options. With a list so versatile, prepare to be spoilt for choice. Explore a variety of frames like oval, rectangular, square, and more. Aviator sunglasses are a popular choice. Wayfarers are a good option to wear while running, riding, travelling, and other sporty activities. In addition to sunglasses, you will find case covers for your eyewear here too.
