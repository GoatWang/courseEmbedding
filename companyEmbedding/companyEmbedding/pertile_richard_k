Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal.

                                            I've had a NetSpend prepaid debit card for approximately 3 years. Up until recently I've had no problem.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

Richard credits his success to focusing on relationships, providing personal attention during an individual’s troubled time, and creating unmatched originality in his rewards and recognition programs. During the 14 years that Richard was contracted with Cornerstone America, they achieved year-over-year compounded growth of 30% and had more than $1 billion in sales by the year-end 2003. Richard helped grow the sales organization from several to over 8,000 independent contractors in 40 states.
Richard left Cornerstone America to semi-retire in May of 2004.  He began doing charity work for the local schools and youth football including coaching and press box announcing.  He took the time with His wife Debbie to get more involved in the community donating both time and money to different local charities and events, while spending time with his two growing boys, then 13 and 9 years old.
In October 2006 he was contacted by Mr. Peter Nauert with an opportunity to build a new Insurance Agency called Independent Producers of America.  After turning down $250,000 employee salary and expense account he decided to work for straight commission as President and Chief Marketing officer building “IPA”.  Mr. Nauert became ill with cancer in July 2007 and passed away in September 2007.  Richard then made a decision to continue to build and run IPA with his personal funds and to keep the company growing.  In January 2008 Richard approached a public company “American Independent Corporation” to acquire 51% interest in the company.  In April 2008 the partnership was formed and IPA became a public company.  In March 2010 Richard decided to go into retirement once again.
Richard since then took the time to spend with his family, travel and once again getting involved with charity work with the latest being the Juvenile Protective Services Program of Florida serving troubled, minor children.  He installed a complete work out facility, recording studio, several plasma TV’s and did several weeks of maintenance all at his expense.  Working around this type of environment has once again provided a new passion to help and serve others. 
In 2014,  Richard came out of retirement once again because he saw an opportunity to help children and adults with medical conditions through the use of medical marijuana. He partnered up with his business partner and formed JR Cannabis Industries, LLC and MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
