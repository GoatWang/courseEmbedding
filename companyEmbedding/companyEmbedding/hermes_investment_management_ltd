Responsibility is at the heart of our mission












Home / About Us / Responsibility 







Investing to improve retirement and help create a better societyWe recognise that as fiduciaries, entrusted with the savings of millions of individuals, we have responsibilities which go beyond those defined in any contract - these are to our clients and their ultimate beneficiaries, and also to the financial community and broader society in which we operate. We have these responsibilities because our activities will have impacts on the world in which our beneficiaries live and work today as well as the one in which they will retire into tomorrow






“It is the decisions we make on how we spend our beneficiaries’ money that shapes the society they live in. Our agenda is defined by them.”


Saker Nusseibeh
Chief Executive


 






We are cognisant of our commitment to clients to deliver superior risk-adjusted investment returns within the terms of our mandate. We also understand however, that the way we achieve our investment objectives will have an impact that is more than purely financial. As such we seek to provide both for a better financial future as well as for a better, more sustainable, society in which to spend that future.
More detail about our approach is set out below.
ESG aware investment strategies
We believe that a responsible approach to investing is appropriate across all asset classes and for all investment strategies.
Our ability to mitigate ESG risks and to capture investment opportunities arising from these considerations is essential to achieving consistent investment out-performance and delivering for our clients.

Integrating ESG risks into our investments
ESG Investing: it still makes you feel good, it still makes you money

Active ownership and management
We do not believe that our responsibilities as investors stop with a decision to buy or sell a stock or asset. Instead, across our strategies we endeavour to act as a responsible steward of investments through constructive dialogue, utilisation of our rights as investors and taking action where necessary.
Our stewardship business, Hermes EOS, boasting one of the largest stewardship resources globally, enables asset owners to meet their fiduciary responsibilities more effectively (and meaningfully).
In situations where we directly manage assets, such as in real-estate, we are committed to acting consistently and clearly as stewards of the assets which we own.
Advocating in beneficiaries’ interest
We also believe it is our responsibility to lead and participate in discussion and debate about the fiduciary responsibilities of institutional investors to their clients, their stakeholders and ultimately, society at large. To that end, Hermes has a broad public policy engagement agenda directed towards promoting responsible investment and ownership practices and more pertinently advocating for a global financial system that operates in the interests of its ultimate beneficiaries.

Responsible Capitalism
The 300 Club

Behaving as a responsible business
We are conscious that we should strive to meet the expectations that we have of others.
We are proud to have a strong culture of responsibility and aspire to both maintain and further foster this client focused approach. The Hermes Pledge of Responsibility and Transparency, created in 2015, expresses our commitment to always put the interests of our clients and their beneficiaries at the heart of what we do.
In addition to our behaviours as individual employees and the delivery of strong investment performance for our clients, we also believe we should lead by example as a firm. Hermes strives therefore to make a difference, not only through our investment solutions, but in how we contribute to both the financial system and wider community.

We permit the publication of our auditors’ report, provided the report is published in full only and is accompanied by the full financial statements to which our auditors’ report relates, and is only published on an access-controlled page on your website https://www.hermes-investment.com, to enable users to verify that an auditors’ report by independent accountants has been commissioned by the directors and issued. Such permission to publish is given by us without accepting or assuming any responsibility or liability to any third party users save where we have agreed terms with them in writing.
Our consent is given on condition that before any third party accesses our auditors’ report via the webpage they first document their agreement to the following terms of access to our report via a click-through webpage with an 'I accept' button. The terms to be included on your website are as follows:
I accept and agree for and on behalf of myself and the Trust I represent (each a "recipient") that:

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) accepts no liability (including liability for negligence) to each recipient in relation to PwC’s report. The report is provided to each recipient for information purposes only. If a recipient relies on PwC’s report, it does so entirely at its own risk;
No recipient will bring a claim against PwC which relates to the access to the report by a recipient;
Neither PwC’s report, nor information obtained from it, may be made available to anyone else without PwC’s prior written consent, except where required by law or regulation; and
PwC’s report was prepared with Hermes Property Unit Trust's interests in mind. It was not prepared with any recipient's interests in mind or for its use. PwC’s report is not a substitute for any enquiries that a recipient should make. The financial statements are as at 25 March 2017, and thus PwC’s auditors’ report is based on historical information. Any projection of such information or PwC’s opinion thereon to future periods is subject to the risk that changes may occur after the reports are issued and the description of controls may no longer accurately portray the system of internal control. For these reasons, such projection of information to future periods would be inappropriate.
PwC will be entitled to the benefit of and to enforce these terms.

We permit the publication of our auditors’ report, provided the report is published in full only and is accompanied by the full financial statements to which our auditors’ report relates, and is only published on an access-controlled page on your website https://www.hermes-investment.com, to enable users to verify that an auditors’ report by independent accountants has been commissioned by the directors and issued. Such permission to publish is given by us without accepting or assuming any responsibility or liability to any third party users save where we have agreed terms with them in writing.
Our consent is given on condition that before any third party accesses our auditors’ report via the webpage they first document their agreement to the following terms of access to our report via a click-through webpage with an 'I accept' button. The terms to be included on your website are as follows:
I accept and agree for and on behalf of myself and the Trust I represent (each a "recipient") that:

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) accepts no liability (including liability for negligence) to each recipient in relation to PwC’s report. The report is provided to each recipient for information purposes only. If a recipient relies on PwC’s report, it does so entirely at its own risk;
No recipient will bring a claim against PwC which relates to the access to the report by a recipient;
Neither PwC’s report, nor information obtained from it, may be made available to anyone else without PwC’s prior written consent, except where required by law or regulation; and
PwC’s report was prepared with Hermes Property Unit Trust's interests in mind. It was not prepared with any recipient's interests in mind or for its use. PwC’s report is not a substitute for any enquiries that a recipient should make. The financial statements are as at 25 March 2017, and thus PwC’s auditors’ report is based on historical information. Any projection of such information or PwC’s opinion thereon to future periods is subject to the risk that changes may occur after the reports are issued and the description of controls may no longer accurately portray the system of internal control. For these reasons, such projection of information to future periods would be inappropriate.
PwC will be entitled to the benefit of and to enforce these terms.

Hermes Investment Management is an investment management firm providing public and private markets investment strategies and engagement services to institutional and wholesale investors, operating worldwide.
Established in 1983 as the principal manager of its owner, the BT Pension Scheme, Hermes now employs 116 investment professionals, but 425 total staff, in its London head office, Singapore and New York.
At 31 March 2017, it managed £30.8 billion of assets and engaged on £264.2 billion in assets.[1][2][3][4]
Hermes’ public markets investment capabilities include: equities, credit and multi asset. Its private markets capabilities include: real estate, infrastructure, private debt and private equity. The company’s engagement services aim to the mitigate strategic, environmental, social and governance risks of companies invested in. The company manages fifteen offshore funds.[5]
The Hermes Investment Office monitors the activities of each investment team to verify that they are adhering to mandates set by clients, and validates the performance of each strategy. Based in London, Hermes Investment Management also has an office in Singapore.[6]
History[edit]
Hermes began operating in 1983 as PosTel Investment Management Limited (PosTel) in 1983,[7] the investment management team of the Post Office Staff Superannuation Fund. The fund subsequently split into two pension schemes, the Post Office and British Telecommunications Staff Superannuation schemes. In 1995, the trustees of the BT Pension Scheme purchased the Post Office scheme’s holding in PosTel. Following this purchase, the business changed its name to Hermes.[8]
Hermes continues to be the principal investment manager for the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS) and since 2012 has sought to create a third-party client base. In 2014, Hermes rebranded as Hermes Investment Management, to reflect its fast growling global investment management firm.[9][10]
In January 2016, Hermes Investment Management announced that David Stewart would replace Paul Spencer as chairman. Stewart, who was previously on the board as a non-executive director took up the chairmanship position on 1 April.[11] In June 2016 Hermes spoke out against short-termism in the industry, pushing fund managers to focus on long term performance.[12]
At 31 December 2016, Hermes Investments third-party clients included institutional and wholesale investors in the UK, Europe, United States, north Asia and Australia. At 30 September 2016, third-party clients accounted for 48% of the company’s revenues.

We permit the publication of our auditors’ report, provided the report is published in full only and is accompanied by the full financial statements to which our auditors’ report relates, and is only published on an access-controlled page on your website https://www.hermes-investment.com, to enable users to verify that an auditors’ report by independent accountants has been commissioned by the directors and issued. Such permission to publish is given by us without accepting or assuming any responsibility or liability to any third party users save where we have agreed terms with them in writing.
Our consent is given on condition that before any third party accesses our auditors’ report via the webpage they first document their agreement to the following terms of access to our report via a click-through webpage with an 'I accept' button. The terms to be included on your website are as follows:
I accept and agree for and on behalf of myself and the Trust I represent (each a "recipient") that:

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) accepts no liability (including liability for negligence) to each recipient in relation to PwC’s report. The report is provided to each recipient for information purposes only. If a recipient relies on PwC’s report, it does so entirely at its own risk;
No recipient will bring a claim against PwC which relates to the access to the report by a recipient;
Neither PwC’s report, nor information obtained from it, may be made available to anyone else without PwC’s prior written consent, except where required by law or regulation; and
PwC’s report was prepared with Hermes Property Unit Trust's interests in mind. It was not prepared with any recipient's interests in mind or for its use. PwC’s report is not a substitute for any enquiries that a recipient should make. The financial statements are as at 25 March 2017, and thus PwC’s auditors’ report is based on historical information. Any projection of such information or PwC’s opinion thereon to future periods is subject to the risk that changes may occur after the reports are issued and the description of controls may no longer accurately portray the system of internal control. For these reasons, such projection of information to future periods would be inappropriate.
PwC will be entitled to the benefit of and to enforce these terms.

I accept
