Guaranteed product features are dependent upon minimum premium requirements and the claims-paying ability of the life insurance company issuing the life insurance contract.
Term Insurance, Universal Life Insurance:
Insurance products are issued by: John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.), Boston, MA 02116 (not licensed in New York) and John Hancock Life Insurance Company of New York, Valhalla, NY 10595.
Insurance policies and/or associated riders and features may not be available in all states.
Variable Life Insurance:
Insurance products are issued by: John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.), Boston, MA 02116 (not licensed in New York) and John Hancock Life Insurance Company of New York, Valhalla, NY 10595 and securities offered through John Hancock Distributors LLC through other broker/dealers that have a selling agreement with John Hancock Distributors LLC, 197 Clarendon Street, Boston, MA 02116.
Insurance policies and/or associated riders and features may not be available in all states.  Some riders may have additional fees and expenses associated with them.  Refer to the product prospectus for additional information.
Variable universal life insurance has annual fees and expenses associated with it in addition to life insurance related charges (which differ with the product chosen), including surrender charges and investment management fees. Variable universal life insurance products are long-term contracts and are sold by prospectus. They are subject to market risk due to the underlying sub-accounts, and are unsuitable as a short term savings vehicle. The primary purpose of variable universal life insurance is to provide lifetime protection against economic loss due to the death of the insured person. Cash values are not guaranteed if the client is invested in the investment accounts. There are risks associated with each investment option, and the policy may lose value.

What are my options?







1. Roll over to the GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA
You can roll over the market value of your investments in the Guaranteed Income for Life 401(k) plan with John Hancock to the Guaranteed Income for Life (GIFL) Rollover Variable Annuity IRA with John Hancock.
This option allows you to preserve the Benefit Base and also to make future contributions to your GIFL account and further grow the Benefit Base. For more information click here to access the FAQ section of this web site.  Also read the GIFL Prospectus found in the Forms and Download section of this web site.



2. Stay in your existing plan
You may be able to leave your money in your previous employer's GIFL option with John Hancock if your plan permits. Your Benefit Base will be preserved, and might increase in the future if the market value exceeds the Benefit Base on your contract's anniversary date. However, you will not be able to make new contributions, and there may be different rules for inactive employees.



3. Roll over to a Traditional IRA or transfer to a new employer's      plan
If you roll over to a non-GIFL IRA, you will no longer have the Guaranteed Income for Life option. Once the rollover IRA account is opened and your 401(k) balance is transferred to it, you can invest your money in the portfolio allocation options available within the rollover IRA you have selected.
If you transfer into a new employer's qualified plan you will no longer have the Guaranteed Income for Life option.  Portfolio options will be determined by the new employer's plan.



4. Take a cash distribution
You'll no longer have the Guaranteed Income for Life option. If you remove your money from your 401(k) plan and take it in cash, the distribution will be subject to a potential 20% federal income tax withholding and possibly additional federal, state, and local income taxes at tax time. A cash distribution may also be subject to a 10% IRS early withdrawal penalty if taken prior to age 59˝.

Guaranteed Income for Life Rollover Variable Annuity IRA is distributed by John Hancock Distributors LLC, Member FINRA.
The guarantees are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuer.
Contact your financial advisor or call 1-888-695-4472 for more information including product and fund prospectuses that contain complete details on investment objectives, risks, fees, charges and expenses as well as other information about the investment company, which should be carefully considered. Please read the prospectuses carefully prior to purchasing. The prospectuses contain this and other information on the product and the underlying portfolios.
When considering an annuity for use in an IRA or other tax-qualified retirement plan, it is important to note that there is no additional tax-deferral benefit, since these plans are already afforded tax-deferred status. Thus, an annuity should only be purchased in an IRA or qualified plan if some of the other features of the annuity are of value, such as access to specific portfolio choices, the ability to have guaranteed payments for life and other guaranteed benefits, and you are willing to incur any additional costs associated with the annuity to receive such benefits.

risks of purchasing the policy. You should read this section before

owning and surrendering the policy.

This section gives more details about the policy. It may repeat certain

$25,000 for the Whole Life Policy, $50,000 for the Whole Life P 50 Policy and   
$100,000 for the Whole Life 100 Policy. For the Whole Life Policy and the Whole 
Life P 50 Policy, all persons insured must meet certain health and other        
criteria called "underwriting standards." All persons insured under the Whole   
Life 100 Policy must meet "preferred risk" and non-smoking underwriting         
standards. All policies may be issued on insured persons between ages of 0 and  
75. Discounts are available to insured persons meeting non-smoking underwriting 
criteria.                                                                       

The policy's primary purpose is to provide lifetime protection against
economic loss due to the death of the insured person. The policy is unsuitable  
as a short-term savings vehicle because of the substantial policy-level         
charges. We are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the policy. The     
value of the amount you have invested under the policy may increase or decrease 
daily based upon the investment results of the variable investment options that 
you choose. The amount we pay to the policy's beneficiary insured person (we    
call this the "death benefit") may be similarly affected. That's why the policy 
is referred to as a "variable" life insurance policy. We call the investments   
you make in the policy "premiums" or "premium payments."

Summary of policy benefits

Death benefit                                                                   

In your application for the policy, you will tell us how much life    
insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person. This is called   
the "Sum Insured."                                                              

When the insured person dies, we will pay the death benefit minus any 
indebtedness. The death benefit will be an amount equal to the greater of the   
guaranteed minimum death benefit and the Variable Sum Insured on the date of    
death of the insured person. The Variable Sum Insured is an amount equal to the 
Initial Sum Insured at issue and thereafter varies, as discussed under          
"Variable Sum Insured".                                                         

Surrender of the policy                                                         

  You may surrender the policy in full at any time. If you do, we will pay
you the account value of the policy less any outstanding policy plus any        
dividends and interest unpaid or unapplied, and the cash value of any insurance 
purchased under any dividend option with an adjustment to reflect the           
difference between the gross premium and the net premium for the period beyond  
the date of surrender, less any indebtedness. This is called your "surrender    
value." You must return your policy when you request a surrender.               

If you have not taken a loan on your policy, the "cash value" of your 
policy (assuming you take all dividend payments in cash) will, on any given     
date, be equal to:                                                              

o the amount you invested,                                            

    o plus or minus the investment experience of the investment options you've
chosen, and                                                               

o minus all charges we deduct.                                        

If you take a loan on your policy, your cash value will be computed   
somewhat differently. This is discussed under "Policy Loans."

Policy loans                                                                    

    You may borrow from your policy at any time after the first policy year by
completing the appropriate form. The minimum amount of each loan is $100. The   
maximum amount you can borrow is determined by a formula. Interest is charged   
on each loan. You can pay the interest or allow it to become part of the        
outstanding loan balance. You can repay all or part of a loan at any time. If   
there is an outstanding loan when the insured person dies, it will be deducted  
from the death benefit. Policy loans permanently affect the calculation of your 
cash value, and may also result in adverse tax consequences.

Optional benefit riders                                                         

    When you apply for the policy, you can request any of the optional benefit
riders that we make available. There are a number of such riders. Charges for   
most riders will be deducted monthly from the policy's account value.           

Investment options                                                              

  The policy offers a number of investment options, as listed on the cover
of this prospectus. They cover a broad spectrum of investment styles and        
strategies. Although the funds of the Series Funds that underlie those          
investment options operate like publicly traded mutual funds, there are         
important differences between your investment options and publicly-traded       
mutual funds. On the plus side, you can transfer money from one investment      
option to another without tax liability. Moreover, any dividends and capital    
gains distributed by each underlying fund are automatically reinvested and      
reflected in the fund's value and create no taxable event for you. On the       
negative side, if and when policy earnings are distributed (generally as a      
result of a surrender or partial withdrawal), they will be treated as ordinary  
income instead of as capital gains. Also, you must keep in mind that you are    
purchasing an insurance policy and you will be assessed charges at the policy   
level as well as at the fund level. Such policy level charges are significant   
and will reduce the investment performance of your investment options.          

Summary of policy risks

Lapse risk                                                                      

    If you don't pay a premium when due, you will have a 31 day "grace period"
to make that payment. If you don't pay the premium by the end of the grace      
period, your policy will terminate (i.e., lapse). All coverage under the policy 
will then cease. Even if the policy terminates in this way, you can still       
reactivate (i.e., "reinstate") it within 3 years from the beginning of the      
grace period, unless the surrender value has been paid or otherwise exhausted,  
or the period of any extended term coverage (discussed below) has expired. To   
reinstate the policy, you must make the required premium payments and           
satisfying certain other conditions.                                            

    Since withdrawals reduce your account value, withdrawals increase the risk
of lapse. Loans also increase the risk of lapse.                                

Investment risk                                                                 

   As mentioned above, the investment performance of any variable investment
option may be good or bad. Your account value will rise or fall based on the    
investment performance of the variable investment options you've chosen. Some   
variable investment options are riskier than others. These risks (and potential 
rewards) are discussed in detail in the attached prospectuses of the Series     
Funds.                                                                          

Transfer risk                                                                   

  There is a risk that you will not be able to transfer your account value
from one investment option to another because of limitations on the frequency   
of transfers you can make. The limitations on transfers out of the fixed        
account are more restrictive than those that apply to transfers out of          
investment accounts.                                                            

Market timing risk                                                              

  Variable investment options in variable life insurance products can be a
prime target for abusive transfer activity because these products value their   
variable investment options on a daily basis and allow transfers among variable 
investment options without immediate tax consequences. As a result, some        
investors may seek to frequently transfer into and out of variable investment   
options in reaction to market news or to exploit a perceived pricing            
inefficiency. Whatever the reason, long-term investors in a variable investment 
option can be harmed by frequent transfer activity since such activity may      
expose the investment option's underlying fund to increased portfolio           
transaction costs and/or disrupt the fund manager's ability to effectively      
manage the fund's investment portfolio in accordance with the fund's investment 
objectives and policies, both of which may result in dilution with respect to   
interests held for long-term investment.                                        

    To discourage disruptive frequent trading activity, we impose restrictions
on transfers (see "Transfers of existing account value") and reserve the right  
to change, suspend or terminate telephone and facsimile transaction privileges  
(see "How you communicate with us"). In addition, we reserve the right to take  
other actions at any time to restrict trading, including, but not limited to:   
(i) restricting the number of transfers made during a defined period, (ii)      
restricting the dollar amount of transfers,

P-->4976th Page of 31TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 6th
and (iii) restricting transfers into and out of certain investment accounts. We 
also reserve the right to defer a transfer at any time we are unable to         
purchase or redeem shares of the underlying fund.                               

While we seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading     
activity, it may not always be possible to do so. Therefore, no assurance can   
be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing all   
disruptive frequent trading and avoiding harm to long-term investors.           

Tax risks                                                                       

 In order for you to receive the tax benefits extended to life insurance
under the Internal Revenue Code, your policy must comply with certain           
requirements of the Code. We will monitor your policy for compliance with these 
requirements, but a policy might fail to qualify as life insurance in spite of  
our monitoring. If this were to occur, you would be subject to income tax on    
the income credited to your policy for the period of disqualification and all   
subsequent periods. The tax laws also contain a so-called "7 pay limit" that    
limits the amount of premium that can be paid in relation to the policy's death 
benefit. If the limit is violated, the policy will be treated as a "modified    
endowment contract", which can have adverse tax consequences. There are also    
certain Treasury Department rules referred to as the "investor control rules"   
that determine whether you would be treated as the "owner" of the assets        
underlying your policy. If that were determined to be the case, you would be    
taxed on any income or gains those assets generate. In other words, you would   
lose the value of the so-called "inside build-up" that is a major benefit of    
life insurance.                                                                 

    There is also a tax risk associated with policy loans. Although no part of
a loan is treated as income to you when the loan is made, surrender or lapse of 
the policy would result in the loan being treated as a distribution at the time 
of lapse or surrender. This could result in a considerable tax bill. Under      
certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans and an       
insured person of advanced age, you might find yourself having to choose        
between high premium requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a        
significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur.                         

    Tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal,
state and local estate, inheritance, gift and other tax laws can vary greatly   
depending upon the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary. There can also   
be unfavorable tax consequences on such things as the change of policy          
ownership or assignment of ownership interests. For these and all the other     
reasons mentioned above, we recommend you consult with a qualified tax adviser  
before buying the policy and before exercising certain rights under the policy.

FEE TABLES
This section contains five tables that describe all of the fees and   
expenses that you will pay when buying, owning and surrendering the policy. In  
the first three tables, only one entry shows the minimum charge, the maximum    
charge and the charge for a representative insured person. Other entries show   
only the maximum charge we can assess and are labeled as such. The remaining    
entries are always calculated in the same way, so we cannot assess a charge     
that is greater than the charge shown in the table. Except where necessary to   
show a rate greater than zero, all rates shown in the tables have been rounded  
to two decimal places as required by prospectus disclosure rules. Consequently, 
the actual rates charged may be slightly higher or lower than those shown.      

    The first table below describes the fees and expenses that you will pay at
the time that you pay a premium.

(1) The risk charge varies by the issue age of the insured person. The charge   
shown is for a policy issued to cover a 75 year old. This charge is     
imbedded in the base premium.                                           

(2) This charge varies by the issue age of the insured person and the length of 
time the policy has been in effect. The charge shown is for a policy    
issued to cover a 75 year old that is in its eighth policy year. This   
charge is imbedded in the base premium.

The next two tables describe the fees and expenses that you will pay  
periodically during the time you own the policy. These tables do not include    
fees and expenses paid at the fund level. Except for the policy loan interest   
rate, the charges shown in the first table are deducted from your policy        
assets. The second table is devoted only to optional rider benefits. The        
charges shown in the rider table are, in fact, premiums that must be paid with  
premiums for the base policy.

(1) The insurance charge is determined by multiplying the amount of insurance   
for which we are at risk (the amount at risk or "AAR") by the applicable
  cost of insurance rate. The rates vary widely depending upon the length of
 time the policy has been in effect, the insurance risk characteristics of
the insured person and (generally) the gender of the insured person. The
  "minimum" rate shown in the table is the rate in the first policy year for
a policy issued to cover a 10 year old female preferred non-tobacco     
underwriting risk. The "maximum" rate shown in the table is the rate in 
the first policy year for a policy issued to cover a 99 year old male   
 substandard tobacco underwriting risk. This includes the so-called "extra
 mortality charge." The "representative insured person" referred to in the
table is a 45 year old male preferred non-tobacco underwriting risk. The
charges shown in the table may not be particularly relevant to your     
current situation. For more information about cost of insurance rates,  
talk to your John Hancock representative.                               

(2) The effective annual rate equivalents of the actual unrounded daily rates   
charged are .50% and .50%, respectively.                                        

(3) 8.0% is the effective annual interest rate charged in states where the      
fixed loan interest rate is applicable. In all other states, the loan   
interest rate is variable and will not be less than 5.50%. The amount of
any loan is transferred from the investment options to a special loan   
 account which earns interest at an effective annual rate that is not more
 than 2.0% less than the loan interest rate then being charged. Therefore,
the true cost of a loan is the difference between the loan interest we  
charge and the interest we credit to the special loan account.

    The next table describes the fees and expenses for each class of shares of
each portfolio underlying a variable investment option offered through this     
prospectus. None of the portfolios charge a sales load or surrender fee.The     
fees and expenses do not reflect the fees and expenses of any variable          
insurance contract or qualified plan which may use theportfolio as its          
underlying investment medium. All of the portfolios shown in the table are NAV  
class shares that are not subject to Rule 12b-1 fees. The expense ratios shown  
in the table for the NAV class shares of a portfolio are estimates for the      
current fiscal year. In those cases where a portfolio had a Series I class of   
shares in operation during 2005, the NAV class estimates are based upon the     
expense ratios of the portfolio's Series I shares for the year ended            
December 31, 2005 (adjusted to reflect the absence of a Rule 12b-1 fee          
applicable to the NAV shares).

IThe adviser for this fund has agreed, pursuant to its agreement with the John  
Hancock Trust, to waive its management fee (or, if necessary, reimburse         
expenses of the fund) to the extent necessary to limit the fund`s "Annual       
Operating Expenses". A fund's "Annual Operating Expenses" includes all of its   
operating expenses including advisory fees and Rule 12b-1 fees, but excludes    
taxes, brokerage commissions, interest, litigation and indemnification expenses 
and extraordinary expenses of the fund not incurred in the ordinary course of   
the fund`s business. Under the agreement, the adviser's obligation will remain  
in effect until May 1, 2007 and will terminate after that date only if the John 
Hancock Trust, without the prior written consent of the adviser, sells shares   
of the fund to (or has shares of the fund held by) any person other than the    
variable life insurance or variable annuity insurance separate accounts of John 
Hancock Life Insurance Company or any of its affiliates that are specified in   
the agreement. If this fee waiver had been reflected, the management fee shown  
for the, International Equity Index Trust B and Money Market Trust B would      
be 0.22% and 0.22%, respectively, and the Total Fund Annual Expenses shown would
be 0.25% and 0.25%, respectively.

DETAILED INFORMATION
 This section of the prospectus provides additional detailed information
that is not contained in the Summary of Benefits and Risks section.             

Table of Investment Options and Investment Subadvisers                          

    When you select a Separate Account investment option, we invest your money
in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the John Hancock Trust (the "Trust")  
and hold the shares in a sub-account of the Separate Account. The Fee Tables    
show the investment management fees, Rule 12b-1 fees and other operating        
expenses for these portfolio shares as a percentage (rounded to two decimal     
places) of each portfolio's average net assets for 2005, except as indicated in 
the footnotes appearing at the end of the table. Fees and expenses of the       
portfolios are not fixed or specified under the terms of the policies and may   
vary from year to year. These fees and expenses differ for each portfolio and   
reduce the investment return of each portfolio. Therefore, they also indirectly 
reduce the return you will earn on any Separate Account investment options you  
select.                                                                         

   The John Hancock Trust is a so-called "series" type mutual funds and each
is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act") as an       
open-end management investment company. John Hancock Investment Management      
Services, LLC ("JHIMS LLC") provides investment advisory services to the Trust  
and receives investment management fees for doing so. JHIMS pays a portion of   
its investment management fees to other firms that manage the Trust's           
portfolios. We and our affiliate own JHIMS LLC and indirectly benefit from any  
investment management fees JHIMS LLC retains.                                   

  The portfolios pay us or certain of our affiliates compensation for some
of the distribution, administrative, shareholder support, marketing and other   
services we or our affiliates provide to the portfolios. The amount of this     
compensation is based on a percentage of the assets of the portfolios           
attributable to the variable insurance products that we and our affiliates      
issue. These percentages may differ from portfolio to portfolio and among       
classes of shares within a portfolio. In some cases, the compensation is        
derived from the Rule 12b-1 fees that are deducted from a portfolio's assets    
for the services we or our affiliates provide to that portfolio. In addition,   
compensation payments of up to 0.45% of assets may be made by a portfolio's     
investment advisers or its affiliates.                                          

   The following table provides a general description of the portfolios that
underlie the variable investment options we make available under the policy.    
You bear the investment risk of any portfolio you choose as an investment       
option for your policy. You can find a full description of each portfolio,      
including the investment objectives, policies and restrictions of, and the      
risks relating to investment in the portfolio in the prospectus for that        
portfolio. You should read the portfolio's prospectus carefully before          
investing in the corresponding variable investment option.                      

The investment options in the Separate Account are not publicly traded
mutual funds. The investment options are only available to you as investment    
options in the policies, or in some cases through other variable annuity        
contracts or variable life insurance policies issued by us or by other life     
insurance companies. In some cases, the investment options also may be          
available through participation in certain qualified pension or retirement      
plans. The portfolios' investment advisers and managers (i.e. subadvisers) may  
manage publicly traded mutual funds with similar names and investment           
objectives. However, the portfolios are not directly related to any publicly    
traded mutual fund. You should not compare the performance of any investment    
option described in this prospectus with the performance of a publicly traded   
mutual fund. The performance of any publicly traded mutual fund could differ    
substantially from that of any of the investment options of our Separate        
Account.                                                                        

The portfolios available under the policies are as follows:

Description of John Hancock                                                     

We are John Hancock Life Insurance Company, a Massachusetts stock life
insurance company. On February 1, 2000, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance      
Company (which was chartered in Massachusetts in 1862) converted to a stock     
company by "demutualizing" and changed its name to John Hancock Life Insurance  
Company. As part of the demutualization process, John Hancock Life Insurance    
Company became a subsidiary of John Hancock Financial Services, Inc., a newly   
formed publicly-traded corporation. In April 2004, John Hancock Financial       
Services, Inc. was merged with a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation,  
a publicly-traded corporation organized under the laws of Canada. The merger    
was effected pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September
28, 2003. As a consequence of the merger, John Hancock's ultimate parent is now 
Manulife Financial Corporation. Our Home Office is at John Hancock Place,       
Boston, Massachusetts 02117. We are authorized to transact a life insurance and 
annuity business in all states and in the District of Columbia. As of December
31, 2005, our assets were approximately $99.3 billion.                          

We are regulated and supervised by the Massachusetts Commissioner of  
Insurance, who periodically examines our affairs. We also are subject to the    
applicable insurance laws and regulations of all jurisdictions in which we are  
authorized to do business. We are required to submit annual statements of our   
operations, including financial statements, to the insurance

departments of the various jurisdictions in which we do business for purposes   
of determining solvency and compliance with local insurance laws and            
regulations. The regulation to which we are subject, however, does not provide  
a guarantee as to such matters.                                                 

  We have received the following ratings from independent rating agencies:

A++ A.M.

not specifically relate to its products, the performance (return) of these      
products, the value of any investment in these products upon withdrawal or to   
individual securities held in any portfolio. These ratings do not apply to the  
safety and performance of the Separate Account.                                 

Description of John Hancock Variable Life Account UV                            

    The variable investment options shown on page 1 are in fact subaccounts of
John Hancock Variable Life Account UV (the "Account"), a separate account       
established by us under Massachusetts law. The Account meets the definition of  
"separate account" under the federal securities laws and is registered as a     
unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. Such registration does not involve    
supervision by the SEC of the management of the Account or of us.               

  The Account's assets are our property. Each policy provides that amounts
we hold in the Account pursuant to the policies cannot be reached by any other  
persons who may have claims against us and can't be used to pay any             
indebtedness of John Hancock other than those arising out of policies that use  
the Account. Income, gains and losses credited to, or charged against, the      
Account reflect the Account's own investment experience and not the investment  
experience of John Hancock's other assets.                                      

    New subaccounts may be added and made available to policy owners from time
to time. Existing subaccounts may be modified or deleted at any time.           

Premiums

Premium payments                                                                

We call the investments you make in the policy "premiums" or "premium 
payments."

Ways to pay premiums                                                            

   If you pay premiums by check or money order, they must be drawn on a U.S.
bank in U.S. dollars and made payable to "John Hancock Life ." We will not      
accept credit card checks. We will not accept starter or third party checks if  
they fail to satisfy our administrative requirements. Premiums after the first  
must be sent to the John Hancock Servicing Office at the appropriate address    
shown on the back cover of this prospectus.                                     

We will also accept premiums:                                         

o by wire or by exchange from another insurance company,              

o via an electronic funds transfer program (any owner interested in making
monthly premium payments must use this method), or                      

  o if we agree to it, through a salary deduction plan with your employer.

 You can obtain information on these other methods of premium payment by
contacting your John Hancock representative or by contacting the John Hancock   
Servicing Office.

Payment period and frequency.                                                   

    Premiums are payable annually or more frequently over the insured person's
lifetime in accordance with our published rules and rates. Premiums are payable 
on or before the due date specified in the policy. A refund or charge will be   
made to effect premium payment to the end of the policy month in which the      
insured person dies.                                                            

Processing premium payments                                                     

 We will process any premium payment as of the day we receive it, unless
one of the following exceptions applies:                                        

  (1) We will process a payment received prior to a policy's date of issue
as if received on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue.     

 (2) If the Minimum Initial Premium is not received prior to the date of
issue, we will process each premium payment received thereafter as if received  
on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue until all of the    
Minimum Initial Premium is received.                                            

(3) We will process the portion of any premium payment for which we   
require evidence of the insured person's continued insurability only after we   
have received such evidence and found it satisfactory to us.                    

    (4) If we receive any premium payment that we think will cause a policy to
become a modified endowment contract or will cause a policy to lose its status  
as life insurance under the tax laws, we will not accept the excess portion of  
that premium payment and will immediately notify the owner. We will refund the  
excess premium when the premium payment check has had time to clear the banking 
system (but in no case more than two weeks after receipt), except in the        
following circumstances:                                                        

 o The tax problem resolves itself prior to the date the refund is to be
made; or                                                                

o The tax problem relates to modified endowment contract status and we    
receive a signed acknowledgment from the owner prior to the refund date 
instructing us to process the premium notwithstanding the tax issues    
involved.                                                               

In the above cases, we will treat the excess premium as having been received on 
the date the tax problem resolves itself or the date we receive the signed      
acknowledgment. We will then process it accordingly.                            

(5) If a premium payment is received or is otherwise scheduled to be  
processed (as specified above) on a date that is not a business day, the        
premium payment will be processed on the business day next following that date. 

Lapse and reinstatement                                                         

    If you don't pay a premium when due, you will have a 31 day "grace period"
to make that payment. If you don't pay the premium by the end of the grace      
period, your policy will terminate (i.e., lapse). All coverage under the policy 
will then cease. Even if the policy terminates in this way, you can still       
reactivate (i.e., "reinstate") it within 3 years from the beginning of the      
grace period, unless the surrender value has been paid or otherwise exhausted,  
or the period of any extended term coverage (discussed below) has expired. You  
will have to provide evidence that the insured person still meets our           
requirements for issuing coverage. You will also have to pay a prescribed       
amount of premium and be subject to the other terms and conditions applicable   
to reinstatements, as specified in the policy. If the insured person dies       
during the grace period, we will deduct any unpaid premium from the death       
benefit, prorated to the end of the month of the insured person's death.        

 Prior to the end of the business day immediately preceding the 70th day
after the beginning of the grace period, any policy values available (as        
determined in accordance with the policy) may be applied as of the beginning of 
the grace period under one of the following options for continued insurance not 
requiring further payment of premiums. These options provide for Variable or    
Fixed Paid-Up Insurance or Fixed Extended Term Insurance on the life of the     
insured person commencing at the beginning of the grace period.                 

    Both the Variable and Fixed Paid-Up Insurance options provide an amount of
paid-up whole life insurance which the available policy values will purchase.   
The amount of Variable Paid-Up Insurance may then increase or decrease in       
accordance with the investment experience of the variable investment options.   
The Fixed Paid-Up Insurance option provides a fixed and level amount of         
insurance. The Fixed Extended Term Insurance option provides a fixed amount of  
insurance determined in accordance with the policy, with the insurance coverage 
continuing for as long a period as the available policy values will purchase.

For example, using a Variable Whole Life P50 Policy (Age 25 years     
Male-Smoker) and a 6% hypothetical gross annual investment return assumption,   
if an option was elected and became effective at the end of policy year 5, the  
insurance coverage provided by the options on lapse would be as follows:        

                                                                [Download Table]

  Variable or Fixed                                                             
 Paid-Up Whole Life                        Fixed Extended Term Insurance        
--------------------                --------------------------------------------
    Death Benefit                    Death Benefit        Term in Years and Days
--------------------       or       ---------------      -----------------------
                                                                                
  $10,427                           $62,736                 12 years 331 days   

If no option has been elected before the end of the business day      
immediately preceding the 70th day after the beginning of the grace period, the 
Fixed Extended Term Insurance option automatically applies unless the amount of 
Fixed Paid-Up Insurance would equal or exceed the amount of Fixed Extended Term 
Insurance or unless the insured person is a substandard risk, in either of      
which cases Fixed Paid-Up Insurance is provided.                                

 If the insured person dies after the grace period but before the end of
the business day immediately preceding the 70th day after the beginning of the  
grace period and prior to any election, and if the policy is then in force, we  
will pay a death benefit equal to the greater of the death benefits provided    
under Fixed Extended Term Insurance (if available) or Fixed Paid-Up Insurance   
determined in accordance with the policy.                                       

   A policy continued under any option may be surrendered for its cash value
while the insured person is living. Loans may be available under the Variable   
and Fixed Paid-Up Insurance options, but not under the Fixed Extended Term      
Insurance option.                                                               

    Generally, the suicide exclusion and incontestability provision will apply
from the effective date of the reinstatement. Your policy will indicate if this 
is not the case. A surrendered policy cannot be reinstatement.                  

The death benefit                                                               

In your application for the policy, you will tell us how much life    
insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person. This is called   
the "Sum Insured."                                                              

When the insured person dies, we will pay the death benefit minus any 
indebtedness. The death benefit will be an amount equal to the greater of the   
guaranteed minimum death benefit and the Variable Sum Insured on the date of    
death of the insured person. The Variable Sum Insured is an amount equal to the 
Initial Sum Insured at issue and thereafter varies, as discussed below.         

Guaranteed minimum death benefit                                                

  The guaranteed minimum death benefit is equal to the Initial Sum Insured
on the date of issue of the policy. We guarantee that, regardless of what your  
variable investment options earn, the death benefit will never be less than the 
guaranteed minimum death benefit.                                               

Variable sum insured                                                            

   After the first policy month, the Variable Sum Insured is determined once
each policy month on the Monthly Date. (The Monthly Date is the first day of a  
policy month which day immediately follows a business day.) The Variable Sum    
Insured remains level during the policy month following the determination.      

   Changes in the Variable Sum Insured for each policy month are computed by
a formula, filed with the insurance supervisory officials of the jurisdiction   
in which the policy has been delivered or issued for delivery. Under the        
formula the difference between the applicable Account Net Investment Rate       
(ANIR) for each business day and the policy's assumed annual rate of 41/2% is   
translated, on an actuarial basis, into a change in the Variable Sum Insured.   

  The Variable Sum Insured would increase on the next Monthly Date only if
the applicable ANIR for the last policy month were sufficiently greater than a  
monthly rate equivalent to an annual rate of 41/2% to result in such an         
increase. If the ANIR was equivalent to an annual rate of less than 41/2%, the  
Variable Sum Insured would be reduced. The percentage change in the Variable    
Sum Insured is not the same as the Account Net Investment Rate, however.

Limitations on payment of death benefit                                         

If the insured person commits suicide within certain time periods, the
amount of death benefit we pay will be limited as described in the policy.      
Also, if an application misstated the age or gender of the insured person, we   
will adjust the amount of any death benefit as described in the policy.         

The account value                                                               

   From each premium payment you make, we deduct the charges described under
"Deductions from premium payments" below. We invest the rest (your so-called    
"net premium") in the investment options you've elected. We invest an amount    
equal to each net premium for your policy on the date of issue and on each      
premium due date thereafter, even if we actually receive your corresponding     
premium payment before or after that date.                                      

 Over time, the amount you've invested in any variable investment option
will increase or decrease the same as if you had invested the same amount       
directly in the corresponding fund of the Series Fund and had reinvested all    
fund dividends and distributions in additional fund shares; except that we will 
deduct certain additional charges which will reduce your cash value. We         
describe these charges under "Description of Charges at the Policy Level."

Annual dividends                                                                

   These policies are participating policies which, except while in force as
Fixed Extended Term Insurance, are entitled to the share, if any, of the        
divisible surplus which we annually determine and apportion to them. Any share  
will be distributed as a dividend payable annually on the policy anniversary    
beginning not later than the end of the second policy year for the Variable     
Whole Life 100 Policy and not later than the end of the third policy year for   
the Variable Whole Life Policy and Variable Whole Life P50 Policy.              

Dividends under participating policies may be described as refunds of 
premiums which adjust the cost of a policy to the actual level of cost emerging 
over time after the policy's issue. Thus, participating policies generally have 
gross premiums which are higher than those for comparable non-participating     
policies. If a policy is surrendered before dividends become payable, you do    
not benefit from having a participating policy.                                 

    Both federal and state law recognize that dividends are considered to be a
refund of a portion of the premium paid and therefore are not treated as income 
for federal or state income tax purposes.                                       

   Dividend illustrations published at the time of issue of a policy reflect
the actual recent experience of the issuing insurance company with respect to   
factors such as interest, mortality, and expenses. State law generally          
prohibits a company from projecting or estimating future results. State law     
also requires that dividends must be based on surplus, after setting aside      
certain necessary amounts, and that such surplus must be apportioned equitably  
among participating policies. In other words, in principle and by statute,      
dividends must be based on actual experience and cannot be guaranteed at issue  
of a policy.                                                                    

    Each year our actuaries analyze the current and recent past experience and
compare it to the assumptions used in determining the premium rates at the time 
of issue. Some of the more important data studied includes mortality and        
withdrawal rates, investment yield in the general account, and actual expenses  
incurred in administering the policies. Such data is then allocated to each     
dividend class, e.g., by year of issue, age, smoking habits and plan. The       
actuaries then determine what dividends can be equitably apportioned to each    
Policy class and make a recommendation to our Board of Directors. The Board of  
Directors, which has the ultimate authority to ascertain dividends, will vote   
the amount of surplus to be apportioned to each policy class, thereby           
authorizing the distribution of each year's dividend.                           

 You may in general elect to have any dividend paid or applied under any
one of the following options: paid in cash; applied to premium payments; left   
to accumulate with interest of at least 31/2% a year; purchase fixed paid-up    
insurance; purchase one year term insurance; or purchase variable paid-up       
insurance.                                                                      

Commencement of investment performance                                          

Any premium payment processed prior to the twentieth day after the    
policy's date of issue will automatically be allocated to the Money Market B    
investment option. On the later of the date such payment is received or the     
twentieth day following the date of issue, the portion of the Money Market B    
investment option attributable to such payment will be reallocated              
automatically among the investment options you have chosen.                     

18

P-->49719th Page of 31TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 19th
   All other premium payments will be allocated among the investment options
you have chosen as soon as they are processed.                                  

Allocation of future premium payments                                           

    At any time, you may change the investment options in which future premium
payments will be invested. You make the original allocation in the application  
for the policy. The percentages you select must be in whole numbers of not less 
than 10% for any option and must total 100%.                                    

Transfers of existing cash value                                                

   You may also transfer your existing cash value from one investment option
to another. To do so, you must tell us how much to transfer, either as a whole  
number percentage or as a specific dollar amount. You may not make more than    
six transfers in each policy year. A confirmation of each transfer will be sent 
to you.                                                                         

    The policies are not designed for professional market timing organizations
or other persons or entities that use programmed or frequent transfers among    
investment options. As a consequence, we have reserved the right to impose      
limits on the number and frequency of transfers into and out of variable        
investment options. Under our current rules, we impose the following            
restrictions on transfers into and out of variable investment options.          
Transfers out of a fixed investment option are subject to additional            
limitations noted below.                                                        

   Subject to the annual restriction noted above, our current practice is to
restrict transfers into or out of variable investment options to two per        
calendar month (except with respect to those policies described in the          
following paragraph). For purposes of this restriction, and in applying the     
limitation on the number of free transfers made during the period from the      
opening of a business day (usually 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time) to the close of that 
business day (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) are considered one transfer. You  
may, however, transfer to the Money Market B investment option even if the two  
transfer per month limit has been reached, but only if 100% of the account      
value in all variable investment options is transferred to the Money Market B   
investment option. If such a transfer to the Money Market B investment option   
is made then, for the 30 calendar day period after such transfers, no transfers 
from the Money Market B investment option to any other investment options       
(variable or fixed) may be made. If your policy offers a dollar cost averaging  
or automatic asset allocation rebalancing program, any transfers pursuant to    
such program are not considered transfers subject to these restrictions on      
frequent trading. The restrictions described in this paragraph will be applied  
uniformly to all policy owners subject to the restrictions.                     

  Policies such as yours may be purchased by a corporation or other entity
as a means to informally finance the liabilities created by an employee benefit 
plan, and to this end the entity may aggregately manage the policies purchased  
to match its liabilities under the plan. Policies sold under these              
circumstances are subject to special transfer restrictions. In lieu of the two  
transfers per month restriction (but still subject to the annual restriction    
noted above), we will allow the policy owner under these circumstances to       
rebalance the investment options in its policies within the following limits:   
(i) during the 10 calendar day period after any account values are transferred  
from one variable investment option into a second variable investment option,   
the values can only be transferred out of the second investment option if they  
are transferred into the Money Market B investment option; and (ii) any account 
values that would otherwise not be transferable by application of the 10 day    
limit described above and that are transferred into the Money Market B          
investment option may not be transferred out of the Money Market B investment   
option into any other investment options (variable or fixed) for 30 calendar    
days. The restrictions described in this paragraph will be applied uniformly to 
all policy owners subject to the restrictions.                                  

If we change any of the above rules relating to transfers, we will notify you   
of the change.                                                                  

Limitation on number of investment options                                      

Whether through the allocation of premium or through the transfer of  
existing cash value, you can never be invested in more than five investment     
options at any one time.                                                        

Surrender                                                                       

You may surrender your policy in full at any time for its "surrender  
value." You must return your policy when you request a full surrender. The      
surrender value will be the policy cash value plus any dividends and interest   
unpaid or unapplied, and the cash value of any insurance purchased under any    
dividend option with an adjustment to reflect the difference between the gross  
premium and the net premium for the period beyond the date of surrender, less   
any indebtedness.

Policy loans                                                                    

 You may borrow from your policy at any time after it has been in effect
for 1 year by completing a form satisfactory to us or, if the telephone         
transaction authorization form has been completed, by telephone. The maximum    
amount you can borrow is what we call your "Loan Value." The Loan Value will be 
90% of the total of the policy cash value (assuming no dividends) and any cash  
value under the variable paid-up insurance dividend option, plus any cash value 
under the fixed paid up insurance dividend option. Interest accrues and is      
compounded daily at an effective annual rate equal to the then applicable       
Variable Loan Interest Rate. However, if you elect the Fixed Loan Interest      
Rate, interest accrues and is compounded daily at an effective annual rate of   
8%.                                                                             

The amount of any outstanding loan plus accrued interest is called the
"indebtedness." Except when used to pay premiums, a loan will not be permitted  
unless it is at least $100. You may repay all or a portion of any indebtedness  
while the insured person is living and premiums are being duly paid. Any loan   
is charged against the variable investment options in proportion to the policy  
cash value allocated to the variable investment options and, upon repayment,    
the repayment is allocated to the variable investment options in proportion to  
the outstanding indebtedness in each variable investment option at such time.   

We determine the Variable Loan Interest Rate annually. The Fixed Loan 
Interest Rate is 8% for the life of the policy. At the time of issue, you can   
elect which loan interest rate will apply to any policy loan. If permitted by   
the law of the state in which the policy is issued, you may change a prior      
choice of loan interest rate. If at the time of such request there is           
outstanding indebtedness, the change will generally become effective on the     
next policy anniversary.                                                        

The Variable Loan Interest Rate determined annually for a policy will 
apply to all indebtedness outstanding during the policy year following the date 
of determination. The rate will not exceed the higher of 51/2% or the Published 
Monthly Average (as defined below) for the calendar month which is two months   
prior to the month in which the date of determination occurs. The Published     
Monthly Average means Moody`s Corporate Bond Yield Average as published by      
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or any successor thereto.                       

    The amount of the loan deducted from the investment options is placed in a
special loan account. This special loan account will earn interest at an        
effective annual rate that is not more than 2% below the interest rate we are   
then charging on the loan (assuming no taxes).                                  

Repayment of policy loans                                                       

If you want a payment to be used as a loan repayment, you must include
instructions to that effect. Otherwise, all payments will be assumed to be      
premium payments. We process loan repayments as of the day we receive the       
repayment.                                                                      

Effects of policy loans                                                         

 The cash value, the net cash surrender value, and the death benefit are
permanently affected by any loan, whether or not it is repaid in whole or in    
part. This is because the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment    
options and placed in a special loan account. The investment options and the    
special loan account will generally have different rates of investment return.  

  The amount of any outstanding indebtedness is subtracted from the amount
otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable.                      

   Whenever the outstanding indebtedness equals or exceeds the policy's cash
value (plus any cash values under a dividend option providing paid-up           
insurance), the policy will terminate 31 days after we have mailed notice of    
termination to you (and to any assignee of record at such assignee's last known 
address) specifying the minimum amount that must be paid to avoid termination,  
unless a repayment of at least the amount specified is made within that period. 
Also, taking out a loan on the policy increases the risk that the policy may    
lapse because of the difference between the interest rate charged on the loan   
and the interest rate credited to the special loan account. Policy loans may    
also result in adverse tax consequences under certain circumstances (see "Tax
considerations").

Description of charges at the policy level

Deductions from premium payments                                                

o Premium tax charge - A charge to cover expected state premium taxes we  
must pay, on average. This charge is 2.5% of each premium.              

o Adjustment for premium payment frequency - If you select a premium      
 payment mode other than annual (so that we receive your premiums over the
 course of the year, rather than all at the beginning), there will be less
value in your policy to support it during the course of the year. To    
 compensate for the risk to us that this creates, the rate we set for each
non- annual premium includes an additional amount that we retain, rather
than crediting it to your policy.                                       

 o Annual administrative charge - A charge of $50 in each policy year to
help defray our annual administrative expenses.                         

o Charge for extra insurance risk - The amount of premiums we may require 
may include an additional component if the insured person presents      
particular mortality risks. We retain these additional amounts to       
compensate us for that risk.                                            

 o Optional benefits charge - The amount of premiums we require is increased
  by an additional component to cover any optional rider benefits you choose
for your policy. We retain such additional amounts to compensate us for 
the obligations we assume under the rider(s).                           

o Premium sales charge - A charge not to exceed 9% of the basic annual    
premium during the period equal to the lesser of 20 years or the        
anticipated life expectancy of the insured person, based on the 1980    
  Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table. (The basic annual premium
is the annual premium less the premiums for any optional rider benefits,
additional charges for extra mortality risks and the $50 annual         
  administrative charge). The charge during the first two policy years shall
not exceed 30% of the basic annual premium paid during the first policy 
  year plus 10% of the basic annual premium paid for the second policy year.
Charges of 10% or less are made for later policy year.                  

o Additional first year administrative charge - A charge in the first     
policy year at the rate of $13 per $1,000 of the Initial Sum Insured (as
  shown in the policy) for a Variable Whole Life Policy, $7 per $1,000 for a
  Variable Whole Life P50 Policy and $4 per $1,000 for a Variable Whole Life
  100 policy or a pro rata portion thereof, to cover administrative expenses
in connection with the issuance of the policy.                          

o Risk charge - A charge necessary to cover the risk we assumed that the  
Variable Sum Insured will be less than the guaranteed minimum death     
benefit. This charge will vary by age of the insured person but averages
approximately 3% of the basic annual premium.                           

o Deduction for dividends - A deduction for dividends to be paid or       
  credited in accordance with the dividend scale in effect on the issue date
of the policy. This deduction will vary by age of the insured person and
duration of the policy but is expected to average approximately 5-9% of 
the basic annual premium.                                               

Deductions from account assets                                                  

o Insurance charge - A monthly charge for the cost of insurance. To       
  determine the charge, we multiply the amount of insurance for which we are
  at risk by a cost of insurance rate. The rate is derived from an actuarial
table. The table in your policy will show the maximum cost of insurance 
 rates. The cost of insurance rates will never be more than those based on
the 1980 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables. Cost of      
 insurance rates generally increase each year that you own your policy, as
the insured person`s attained age increases. (The insured person's      
 "attained age" on any date is his or her age on the birthday nearest that
date).                                                                  

o M & E charge - A daily charge for mortality and expense risks we assume.
 This charge is deducted from the variable investment options. The current
charge is at an effective annual rate of .50% of the value of the assets
in each variable investment option. We guarantee that this charge will  
never exceed an effective annual rate of .50%.                          

Additional information about how certain policy charges work

Sales expenses and related charges                                              

 The premium sales charges help to compensate us for the cost of selling
our policies. (See "Description of Charges at the Policy Level".) The amount of 
the charges in any policy year does not specifically correspond to sales        
expenses for that year. We expect to recover our total sales expenses over the  
life of the policy. To the extent that the sales charges do not cover total     
sales expenses, the sales expenses may be recovered from other sources,         
including gains from the charge for mortality and expense risks and other gains 
with respect to the policies, or from our general assets. Similarly,            
administrative expenses not                                                     

21

fully covered by the annual administrative charge and the additional first year 
administrative charge may also be recovered from such other sources.            

Method of deduction                                                             

   We deduct the monthly charges described in the section from your policy's
investment options in proportion to the amount of cash value you have in each.  

Other charges we could impose in the future                                     

  We currently make no charge for our federal income taxes. However, if we
incur, or expect to incur, additional income taxes attributable to any          
subaccount of the Account or this class of policies in future years, we reserve 
the right to make a charge for such taxes. Any such charge would reduce what    
you earn on any affected investment options. However, we expect that no such    
charge will be necessary.                                                       

Under current laws, we may incur state and local taxes (in addition to
premium taxes) in several states. At present, these taxes are not significant.  
If there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws, we may     
make charges for such taxes.                                                    

Description of charges at the fund level                                        

The funds must pay investment management fees and other operating     
expenses. These fees and expenses (shown in the Fee Tables section) are         
different for each fund and reduce the investment return of each fund.          
Therefore, they also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any variable 
investment options you select. Expenses of the funds are not fixed or specified 
under the terms of the policy, and those expenses may vary from year to year.   

Other policy benefits, rights and limitations

Optional benefit riders you can add                                             

  When you apply for a policy, you can request any of the optional benefit
riders that we then make available. Availability of any rider, the benefits it  
provides and the charges for it may vary by state. Our rules and procedures     
will govern eligibility for any rider and, in some cases, the configuration of  
the actual rider benefits. Each rider contains specific details that you should 
review before you decide to choose the rider. We may change rider premiums (or  
the rates that determine them), but not above any applicable maximum amount     
stated in the Policy Specifications page of your policy. We may add to, delete  
from or modify the following list of optional benefit riders:                   

 o Disability Benefit - Waiver of Premium Rider - This rider waives premiums
for the policy during the total disability (as defined in the rider) of 
the insured person. If total disability begins prior to age 60, premiums
 will be waived for the duration of the policy so long as total disability
  continues. If total disability begins on or after age 60, premiums will be
  waived only up to the earlier of (i) age 65 or (ii) the cessation of total
disability.                                                             

o Fixed Accidental Death Benefit Rider - This rider provides for an       
additional insurance benefit if the insured person`s death is due to    
accidental causes between the policy anniversaries nearest the insured  
person's 5th and 70th birthdays.                                        

o Children's Insurance Benefit Rider - This rider covers children of the  
insured person at the time of application and children born or adopted  
after the rider is purchased. For coverage to begin on any child, he or 
she must be more than 14 days old and less than 15 years old. Coverage  
will continue until the earliest of (i) termination of the rider upon   
request, (ii) lapse of the policy, (iii) the insured person`s 65th      
birthday, (iv) election to convert to permanent coverage on the child's 
  18th birthday, or (v) the child`s 22nd birthday. Since we don't know which
children are covered at any point in time, it is up to you to terminate 
the rider if it no longer suits your needs.                             

o Applicant's Waiver of Premium Benefit Rider - This rider waives premiums
for the policy during the total disability (as defined in the rider) of 
 the applicant for the policy. If total disability begins prior to age 60,
premiums will be waived for the duration of the policy so long as total 
disability continues. If total disability begins on or after age 60,    
premiums will be waived only up to the earlier of (i) age 65 or (ii) the
cessation of total disability.                                          

o Indeterminate Premium YRT Rider on Insured and/or Spouse - This rider   
  provides a level or decreasing amount of term insurance on the life of the
 insured person and/or the insured person's spouse. The benefit is payable
if the person                                                           

22

P-->49723rd Page of 31TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 23rd
 insured under the rider dies during the term period. In applying for this
 rider, you must choose the term period and whether the coverage amount is
level or decreasing.                                                    

o Initial Term Insurance Rider - This rider provides immediate coverage on
the life of the insured person for term periods of one to eleven months 
prior to the policy's date of issue. The rider is for those who want to 
  select a date of issue that is one to eleven months subsequent to the date
of application.                                                         

Changes that we can make as to your policy                                      

    We reserve the right to make any changes in the policy necessary to ensure
the policy is within the definition of life insurance under the federal tax     
laws and is in compliance with any changes in federal or state tax laws.        

In our policies, we reserve the right to make certain changes if they 
would serve the best interests of policy owners or would be appropriate in      
carrying out the purposes of the policies. Such changes include the following:  

   o Changes necessary to comply with or obtain or continue exemptions under
the federal securities laws                                                     

o Combining or removing investment options                            

o Changes in the form of organization of any separate account         

  Any such changes will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable
laws and only in the manner permitted by such laws. When required by law, we    
will obtain your approval of the changes and the approval of any appropriate    
regulatory authority.                                                           

The owner of the policy                                                         

  Who owns the policy? That's up to the person who applies for the policy.
The owner of the policy is the person who can exercise most of the rights under 
the policy, such as the right to choose the investment options or the right to  
surrender the policy. In many cases, the person buying the policy is also the   
person who will be the owner. However, the application for a policy can name    
another person or entity (such as a trust) as owner. Wherever the term "you"    
appears in this prospectus, we've assumed that the reader is the person who has 
the right or privilege being discussed. There may be tax consequences if the    
owner and the insured person are different, so you should discuss this issue    
with your tax adviser. While the insured person is alive, you will have a       
number of options under the policy. Here are some major ones:                   

    o Determine when and how much you invest in the various investment options

o Borrow amounts you have in the investment options                   

o Change the beneficiary who will receive the death benefit           

o Turn in (i.e., "surrender") the policy for the full amount of its   
surrender value                                                           

o Reduce the amount of insurance by surrendering part of the policy   

o Choose the form in which we will pay out the death benefit or other 
proceeds                                                                        

It is possible to name so-called "joint owners" of the policy. If more
than one person owns a policy, all owners must join in most requests to         
exercise rights under the policy.                                               

Policy cancellation right                                                       

You have the right to cancel your policy within the latest of the     
following periods:                                                              

    o 10 days after you receive it (this period may be longer in some states);

    o 10 days after mailing by John Hancock of the Notice of Withdrawal Right;
or                                                                        

o 45 days after the date Part A of the application has been completed.

This is often referred to as the "free look" period. To cancel your   
policy, simply deliver or mail the policy to us at one of the addresses shown   
on the back cover, or to the John Hancock representative who delivered the      
policy to you.                                                                  

    In most states, you will receive a refund of any premiums you've paid. The
date of cancellation will be the date of such mailing or delivery.

Reports that you will receive                                                   

At least annually, we will send you a statement setting forth the     
following information as of the end of the most recent reporting period: the    
amount of the death benefit and cash value, and any outstanding policy loan     
(and interest charged for the preceding policy year). Moreover, you also will   
receive confirmations of transfers among investment options, policy loans and   
certain other policy transactions.                                              

    Semiannually we will send you a report containing the financial statements
of the Series Fund, including a list of securities held in each fund.           

Assigning your policy                                                           

    You may assign your rights in the policy to someone else as collateral for
a loan or for some other reason. Assignments do not require the consent of any  
revocable beneficiary. A copy of the assignment must be forwarded to us. We are 
not responsible for any payment we make or any action we take before we receive 
notice of the assignment in good order. Nor are we responsible for the validity 
of the assignment. An absolute assignment is a change of ownership. All         
collateral assignees of record must consent to any full surrender, partial      
withdrawal or loan from the policy.                                             

When we pay policy proceeds

General                                                                         

   We will pay any death benefit, withdrawal, surrender value or loan within
7 days after we receive the last required form or request (and, with respect to 
the death benefit, any other documentation that may be required). If we don't   
have information about the desired manner of payment within 7 days after the    
date we receive documentation of the insured person's death, we will pay the    
proceeds as a single sum.                                                       

Delay to challenge coverage                                                     

We may challenge the validity of your insurance policy based on any   
material misstatements made to us in the application for the policy. We cannot  
make such a challenge, however, beyond certain time limits that are specified   
in the policy.                                                                  

Delay for check clearance                                                       

We reserve the right to defer payment of that portion of your account 
value that is attributable to a premium payment made by check for a reasonable  
period of time (not to exceed 15 days) to allow the check to clear the banking  
system.                                                                         

Delay of separate account proceeds                                              

   We reserve the right to defer payment of any death benefit, loan or other
distribution that is derived from a variable investment option if (1) the New   
York Stock Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday         
closings) or trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; (2) an       
emergency exists, as a result of which disposal of securities is not reasonably 
practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to fairly determine the account 
value; or (3) the SEC by order permits the delay for the protection of owners.  
Transfers and allocations of account value among the investment options may     
also be postponed under these circumstances. If we need to defer calculation of 
separate account values for any of the foregoing reasons, all delayed           
transactions will be processed at the next values that we do compute.           

Delay of general account surrender proceeds                                     

    State laws allow us to defer payment of any portion of the surrender value
derived from the fixed investment option for up to 6 months. These laws were    
enacted many years ago to help insurance companies in the event of a liquidity  
crisis.                                                                         

How you communicate with us

General rules                                                                   

You should mail or express all checks and money orders for premium    
payments and loan repayments to the John Hancock Servicing Office at the        
appropriate address shown on the back cover.

  Under our current rules, certain requests must be made in writing and be
signed and dated by you. They include the following:                            

o loans                                                               

o surrenders                                                          

o change of beneficiary                                               

o election of payment option for policy proceeds                      

o tax withholding elections                                           

o election of telephone transaction privilege                         

   The following requests may be made either in writing (signed and dated by
you) or by telephone or fax if a special form is completed (see "Telephone and
Facsimile Transactions" below):                                                 

o transfers of account value among investment options                 

  o change of allocation among investment options for new premium payments

    You should mail or express all written requests to our Servicing Office at
the appropriate address shown on the back cover. You should also send notice of 
the insured person`s death and related documentation to our Servicing Office.   
We don't consider that we've "received" any communication until such time as it 
has arrived at the proper place and in the proper and complete form.            

We have special forms that should be used for a number of the requests
mentioned above. You can obtain these forms from our Servicing Office or your   
John Hancock representative. Each communication to us must include your name,   
your policy number and the name of the insured person. We cannot process any    
request that doesn't include this required information. Any communication that  
arrives after the close of our business day, or on a day that is not a business 
day, will be considered "received" by us on the next following business day.    
Our business day currently closes at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, but       
special circumstances (such as suspension of trading on a major exchange) may   
dictate an earlier closing time.                                                

Telephone and facsimile transactions                                            

If you complete a special authorization form, you can request loans,  
transfers among investment options and changes of allocation among investment   
options simply by telephoning us at 1-800-732-5543 or by faxing us at           
617-572-1571. Any fax request should include your name, daytime telephone       
number, policy number and, in the case of transfers and changes of allocation,  
the names of the investment options involved. We will honor telephone           
instructions from anyone who provides the correct identifying information, so   
there is a risk of loss to you if this service is used by an unauthorized       
person. However, you will receive written confirmation of all telephone         
transactions. There is also a risk that you will be unable to place your        
request due to equipment malfunction or heavy phone line usage. If this occurs, 
you should submit your request in writing.                                      

   If you authorize telephone transactions, you will be liable for any loss,
expense or cost arising out of any unauthorized or fraudulent telephone         
instructions which we reasonably believe to be genuine, unless such loss,       
expense or cost is the result of our mistake or negligence. We employ           
procedures which provide safeguards against the execution of unauthorized       
transactions, and which are reasonably designed to confirm that instructions    
received by telephone are genuine. These procedures include requiring personal  
identification, tape recording calls, and providing written confirmation to the 
owner. If we do not employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions   
communicated by telephone are genuine, we may be liable for any loss due to     
unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.                                        

 As stated earlier in this prospectus, the policies are not designed for
professional market timing organizations or other persons or entities that use  
programmed or frequent transfers amoung investment options. For reasons such as 
that, we have imposed restrictions on transfers. However, we also reserve the   
right to change our telephone and facsimile transaction policies or procedures  
at any time. Moreover, we also reserve the right to suspend or terminate the    
privilege altogether with respect to any owners who we feel are abusing the     
privilege to the detriment of other owners.                                     

Distribution of policies                                                        

John Hancock Distributors LLC ("JH Distributors"), a Delaware limited 
liability company affiliated with us, is the principal distributor and          
underwriter of the securities offered through this prospectus and of other      
annuity and life insurance

products we and our affiliates offer. JH Distributors also acts as the          
principal underwriter of the John Hancock Trust, whose securities are used to   
fund certain investment options under the policies and under other annuity and  
life insurance products we offer.                                               

JH Distributors' principal address is 200 Bloor Street East, Toronto, 
Canada M4W 1E5 and it also maintains offices with us at 197 Clarendon Street,   
Boston, Massachusetts 02116. JH Distributors is a broker-dealer registered      
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") and is a member of   
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD").              

We offer the policies for sale through individuals who are licensed as
insurance agents and who are registered representatives of broker-dealers that  
have entered into selling agreements with JH Distributors. These broker-dealers 
may include our affiliate Signator Investors, Inc.                              

   Through JH Distributors, John Hancock pays compensation to broker-dealers
for the promotion and sale of the policies. The registered representative       
through whom your policy is sold will be compensated pursuant to the registered 
representative's own arrangement with his or her broker-dealer. Compensation to 
broker-dealers for the promotion and sale of the policies is not paid directly  
by policyowners but will be recouped through the fees and charges imposed under 
the policy. (See "Description of charges at the policy level".)                 

A limited number of broker-dealers may also be paid commissions or    
overrides to "wholesale" the policies; that is, to provide marketing support    
and training services to the broker-dealer firms that do the actual selling. We 
may also provide compensation to a limited number of broker-dealers for         
providing ongoing service in relation to policies that have already been        
purchased.                                                                      

Standard compensation                                                           

  The compensation paid to sales representatives may vary depending on the
selling agreements, but commissions for sale of the policies (not including     
riders) are not expected to exceed 55% of the premium paid in the first policy  
year, 15% of the premium paid in the second policy year, 10% of the premium     
paid in the third through sixth policy years, 5% of the premium paid in the     
sixth through tenth policy years, and 3% of the premium paid in each policy     
year thereafter. The amount and timing of this compensation may differ among    
sales representatives, but would not be expected to materially exceed the       
foregoing schedule on a present value basis.                                    

Additional compensation and revenue sharing                                     

 To the extent permitted by SEC and NASD rules and other applicable laws
and regulations, selling broker-dealers may receive, directly or indirectly,    
additional payments in the form of cash, other compensation or reimbursement.   
These additional compensation or reimbursement arrangements may include, for    
example, payments in connection with the firm's "due diligence" examination of  
the policies, payments for providing conferences or seminars, sales or training 
programs for invited registered representatives and other employees, payment    
for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred by registered representatives  
and other employees for such seminars or training programs, seminars for the    
public, advertising and sales campaigns regarding the policies, payments to     
assist a firm in connection with its systems, operations and marketing expenses 
and/or other events or activities sponsored by the firms. Subject to applicable 
NASD rules and other applicable laws and regulations, JH Distributors and is    
affiliates may contribute to, as well as sponsor, various educational programs, 
sales contests, and/or other promotions in which participating firms and their  
sales persons may receive prizes such as merchandise, cash or other rewards.    

    These arrangements will not be offered to all firms, and the terms of such
arrangements may differ between firms. We provide additional information on     
special compensation or reimbursement arrangements involving selling firms and  
other financial institutions in the Statement of Additional Information, which  
is available upon request. Any such compensation, which may be significant at   
times, will not result in any additional direct charge to you by us.            

Differential compensation                                                       

Compensation negotiated and paid by John Hancock pursuant to a selling
agreement with a broker-dealer may differ from compensation levels that the     
broker-dealer receives for selling other variable policies or contracts. These  
compensation arrangements may give us benefits such as greater access to        
registered representatives. In addition, under their own arrangements,          
broker-dealer firms may pay a portion of any amounts received under standard or 
additional compensation or revenue sharing arrangements to their registered     
representatives. As a result, registered representatives may be motivated to

sell the policies of one issuer over another issuer, or one product over        
another product. You should contact your registered representative for more     
information on compensation arrangements in connection with your purchase of a  
policy.                                                                         

Tax considerations                                                              

This description of federal income tax consequences is only a brief   
summary and is not intended as tax advice. Tax consequences will vary based on  
your own particular circumstances, and for further information you should       
consult a qualified tax adviser. Federal, state and local tax laws, regulations 
and interpretations can change from time to time. As a result, the tax          
consequences to you and the beneficiary may be altered, in some cases           
retroactively.                                                                  

 The policy may be used in various arrangements, including non-qualified
deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, split dollar insurance      
plans, executive bonus plans, retiree medical benefit plans and others. The tax 
consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and       
circumstances of each individual arrangement. Therefore, if the use of the      
policy in any such arrangment, the value of which depends in part on the tax    
consequences, is contemplated, a qualified tax adviser should be consulted for  
advise on the tax attributes of the particular arrangement.                     

General                                                                         

Generally, death benefits paid under policies such as yours are not   
subject to income tax. Earnings on your account value are ordinarily not        
subject to income tax as long as we don't pay them out to you. If we do pay out 
any amount of your account value upon surrender or partial withdrawal, all or   
part of that distribution would generally be treated as a return of the         
premiums you've paid and not subjected to income tax. However certain           
distributions associated with a reduction in death benefit or other policy      
benefits within the first 15 years after issuance of the policy are ordinarily  
taxable in whole or in part. (See "Other policy distributions" below.) Amounts  
you borrow are generally not taxable to you. (See "Policy loans" below.)        

However, some of the tax rules change if your policy is found to be a 
modified endowment contract. This can happen if you've paid premiums in excess  
of limits prescribed by the tax laws. Additional taxes and penalties may be     
payable for policy distributions of any kind. (See "7-pay premium limit and
modified endowment contract status" below.)                                     

Policy death benefit proceeds                                                   

We expect the policy to receive the same federal income and estate tax
treatment as fixed benefit life insurance policies. Section 7702 of the         
Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") defines a life insurance contract for        
federal tax purposes. For a policy to be treated as a life insurance contract,  
it must satisfy either the cash value accumulation test or the guideline        
premium test. These tests limit the amount of premium that you may pay into the 
policy. We will monitor compliance with these standards. If we determine that a 
policy does not satisfy section 7702, we may take whatever steps are            
appropriate and reasonable to bring it into compliance with Section 7702.       

    If the policy complies with Section 7702, the death benefit proceeds under
the policy should be excludable from the beneficiary's gross income under       
Section 101 of the Code.                                                        

Other policy distributions                                                      

    Increases in policy value as a result of interest or investment experience
will not be subject to federal income tax unless and until values are received  
through actual or deemed distributions. In general, the owner will be taxed on  
the amount of distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy. An  
exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policy's 
death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the 
first 15 years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash            
distribution to the policy owner in order for the policy to continue to comply  
with the Section 7702 definitional limits. Changes that reduce benefits include 
partial withdrawals and death benefit option changes. For purposes of this rule 
any distribution within the two years immediately before a reduction in         
benefits will also be treated as if it caused the reduction. A cash             
distribution that reduces policy benefits will be taxed in whole or in part (to 
the extent of any gain in the policy) under rules prescribed in Section 7702.   
The taxable amount is subject to limits prescribed in section 7702(f)(7). Any   
taxable distribution will be ordinary income to the owner (rather than capital  
gain).                                                                          

   Distributions for tax purposes include amounts received upon surrender or
partial withdrawals. You may also be deemed to have received a distribution for 
tax purposes if you assign all or part of your policy rights or change your     
policy's ownership.

It is possible that, despite our monitoring, a policy might fail to   
qualify as a life insurance contract under section 7702 of the Code. This could 
happen, for example, if we inadvertently failed to return to you any premium    
payments that were in excess of permitted amounts, or if any of the funds       
failed to meet certain investment diversification or other requirements of the  
Code. If this were to occur, you would be subject to income tax on the income   
credited to the policy from the date of issue to the date of the                
disqualification and for subsequent periods.                                    

    Tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal,
state and local estate, inheritance, gift and other tax laws will depend on the 
circumstances of each owner or beneficiary. If the person insured by the policy 
is also its owner, either directly or indirectly through an entity such as a    
revocabale trust, the death benefit will be includible in his or her estate for 
purposes of the federal estate tax. If the owner is not the person insured, the 
value of the policy will be includible in the owner's estate upon his or her    
death. Even if ownership has been transferred, the death proceeds or the        
account value may be includible in the former owner's estate if the transfer    
occurred less than three years before the former owner's death or if the former 
owner retained certain kinds of control over the policy. You should consult     
your tax adviser regarding these possible tax consequences.                     

  Because there may be unfavorable tax consequences (including recognition
of taxable income and the loss of income tax-free treatment for any death       
benefit payable to the beneficiary), you should consult a qualified tax adviser 
prior to changing the policy's ownership or making any assignment of ownership  
interests.                                                                      

Policy loans                                                                    

We expect that, except as noted below (see "7-pay premium limit and
modified endowment contract status"), loans received under the policy will be   
treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan will           
constitute income to the owner. However, if the policy terminates for any       
reason, the amount of any outstanding loan that was not previously considered   
income will be treated as if it had been distributed to the owner upon such     
termination. This could result in a considerable tax bill. Under certain        
circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans, you might find      
yourself having to choose between high premiums requirements to keep your       
policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to      
occur.                                                                          

Diversification rules and ownership of the Account                              

Your policy will not qualify for the tax benefits of a life insurance 
contract unless the Account follows certain rules requiring diversification of  
investments underlying the policy. In addition, the rules require that the      
policy owner not have "investment control" over the underlying assets.          

 In certain circumstances, the owner of a variable life insurance policy
may be considered the owner, for federal income tax purposes, of the assets of  
the separate account used to support the policy. In those circumstances, income 
and gains from the separate account assets would be includible in the policy    
owner's gross income. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has stated in        
published rulings that a variable policy owner will be considered the owner of  
separate account assets if the policy owner possesses incidents of ownership in 
those assets, such as the ability to exercise investment control over the       
assets. A Treasury Decision issued in 1986 stated that guidance would be issued 
in the form of regulations or rulings on the "extent to which Policyholders may 
direct their investments to particular sub-accounts of a separate account       
without being treated as owners of the underlying assets." As of the date of    
this prospectus, no comprehensive guidance on this point has been issued. In    
Rev. Rul. 2003-91, however, the IRS ruled that a contract holder would not be   
treated as the owner of assets underlying a variable life insurance or annuity  
contract despite the owner's ability to allocate funds among as many as twenty  
subaccounts.                                                                    

 The ownership rights under your policy are similar to, but different in
certain respects from, those described in IRS rulings in which it was           
determined that policyholders were not owners of separate account assets. Since 
you have greater flexibility in allocating premiums and policy values than was  
the case in those rulings, it is possible that you would be treated as the      
owner of your policy's proportionate share of the assets of the Account.        

We do not know what future Treasury Department regulations or other   
guidance may require. We cannot guarantee that the funds will be able to        
operate as currently described in the Series Funds` prospectuses, or that a     
Series Fund will not have to change any fund's investment objectives or         
policies. We have reserved the right to modify your policy if we believe doing  
so will prevent you from being considered the owner of your policy's            
proportionate share of the assets of the Account, but we are under no           
obligation to do so.

7-pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status                      

At the time of policy issuance, we will determine whether the Planned 
Premium schedule will exceed the 7-pay limit discussed below. If so, our        
standard procedures prohibit issuance of the policy unless you sign a form      
acknowledging that fact.                                                        

 The 7-pay limit is the total of net level premiums that would have been
payable at any time for a comparable fixed policy to be fully "paid-up" after   
the payment of 7 equal annual premiums. "Paid-up" means that no further         
premiums would be required to continue the coverage in force until maturity,    
based on certain prescribed assumptions. If the total premiums paid at any time 
during the first 7 policy years exceed the 7-pay limit, the policy will be      
treated as a modified endowment contract, which can have adverse tax            
consequences.                                                                   

Policies classified as modified endowment contracts are subject to the
following tax rules:                                                    

 o First, all partial withdrawals from such a policy are treated as ordinary
  income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess (if any) of the
policy value immediately before the distribution over the investment in 
the policy at such time.                                                

o Second, loans taken from or secured by such a policy and assignments or 
pledges of any part of its value are treated as partial withdrawals from
 the policy and taxed accordingly. Past-due loan interest that is added to
the loan amount is treated as an additional loan.                       

o Third, a 10% additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any     
distribution (including distributions on surrender) from, or loan taken 
 from or secured by, such a policy that is included in income except where
the distribution or loan:                                               

o is made on or after the date on which the policy owner attains age  
591/2;                                                                          

o is attributable to the policy owner becoming disabled; or           

o is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the  
life (or life expectancy) of the policy owner or the joint lives (or
joint life expectancies) of the policy owner and the policy owner's 
beneficiary.                                                        

These exceptions to the 10% additional tax do not apply in situations 
where the policy is not owned by an individual.                                 

    Furthermore, any time there is a "material change" in a policy, the policy
will begin a new 7-pay testing period as if it were a newly-issued policy. The  
material change rules for determining whether a policy is a modified endowment  
contract are complex. In general, however, the determination of whether a       
policy will be a modified endowment contract after a material change generally  
depends upon the relationship among the death benefit of the policy at the time 
of such change, the policy value at the time of the change, and the additional  
premiums paid into the Policy during the seven years starting with the date on  
which the material change occurs.                                               

  Moreover, if benefits under a policy are reduced (such as a reduction in
the death benefit or the reduction or cancellation of certain rider benefits)   
during the 7 years in which a 7-pay test is being applied, the 7-pay limit will 
generally be recalculated based on the reduced benefits. If the premiums paid   
to date are greater than the recalculated 7-pay limit, the policy will become a 
modified endowment contract.                                                    

All modified endowment contracts issued by the same insurer (or its   
affiliates) to the same owner during any calendar year generally are required   
to be treated as one contract for the purpose of applying the modified          
endowment contract rules. A policy received in exchange for a modified          
endowment contract will itself also be a modified endowment contract. You       
should consult your tax advisor if you have questions regarding the possible    
impact of the 7-pay limit on your policy.                                       

Corporate and H.R. 10 retirement plans                                          

 The policy may be acquired in connection with the funding of retirement
plans satisfying the qualification requirements of Section 401 of the Code. If  
so, the Code provisions relating to such plans and life insurance benefits      
thereunder should be carefully scrutinized. We are not responsible for          
compliance with the terms of any such plan or with the requirements of          
applicable provisions of the Code.                                              

Withholding                                                                     

To the extent that policy distributions to you are taxable, they are

Life insurance purchases by residents of Puerto Rico                            

In Rev. Rul. 2004-75, 2004-31 I.R.B. 109, the Internal Revenue Service
ruled that income received by residents of Puerto Rico under life insurance     
policy issued by a United States company is U.S.-source income that is subject  
to United States federal income tax.                                            

Life insurance purchases by non-resident aliens                                 

  If you are not a U.S. citizen or resident, you will generally be subject
to U.S. federal withholding tax on taxable distributions from life insurance    
policies at a 30% rate, unless a lower treaty rate applies. In addition, you    
may be subject to state and/or municipal taxes and taxes imposed by your        
country of citizenship or residence. You should consult with a qualified tax    
adviser before purchasing a policy.

SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND RISKS




THE NATURE OF THE POLICY



This is a so-called "survivorship" policy that provides coverage on two
insured persons. The policy's primary purpose is to provide lifetime protection
against economic loss due to the death of the last surviving insured person. The
policy is unsuitable as a short-term savings vehicle because of the substantial
policy-level charges. We are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the
policy. The value of the amount you have invested under the policy may increase
or decrease daily based upon the investment results of the variable investment
options that you choose. The amount we pay to the policy's beneficiary last
surviving insured person (we call this the "death benefit") may be similarly
affected. That's why the policy is referred to as a "variable" life insurance
policy. We call the investments you make in the policy "premiums" or "premium
payments". The amount we require as your first premium depends upon the
specifics of your policy and the insured person. Except as noted in the Detailed
Information section of this prospectus, you can make any other premium payments
you wish at any time. That's why the policy is called a "flexible premium"
policy.


If the life insurance protection described in this prospectus is provided
under a master group policy, the term "policy" as used in this prospectus refers
to the certificate we issue and not to the master group policy.



SUMMARY OF POLICY BENEFITS




Death Benefit



When the last of the insured persons dies, we will pay the death benefit
minus any outstanding loans. There are two ways of calculating the death benefit
(Option A and Option B). You choose which one you want in the application. The
two death benefit options are:


.  Option A - The death benefit will equal the greater of (1) the Total
Sum Insured plus any optional extra death benefit, if elected (as
described below), or (2) the minimum insurance amount (as described
under "The minimum insurance amount" provision in the Detailed
Information section of this prospectus).


.  Option B - The death benefit will equal the greater of (1) the Total
Sum Insured plus your policy's account value on the date of death of
the last surviving insured person, or (2) the minimum insurance amount.



Surrender of the Policy



You may surrender the policy in full at any time. If you do, we will pay
you the account value of the policy less any outstanding policy loans and less
any contingent deferred sales charge that then applies.. This is called your
"surrender value". You must return your policy when you request a surrender.


If you have not taken a loan on your policy, the "account value" of your
policy will, on any given date, be equal to:


.  the amount you invested,


.  plus or minus the investment experience of the investment options
you've chosen,


.  minus all charges we deduct, and


.  minus all withdrawals you have made.


If you take a loan on your policy, your account value will be computed
somewhat differently. This is discussed beginning on page XX.



Partial Withdrawals



You may make a partial withdrawal of your surrender value at any timeafter
the first policy year. Each withdrawal must be at least $1,000. There is a
charge (usually $20) for each partial withdrawal. Your account value is
automatically reduced by


3





the amount of the withdrawal and the charge. We reserve the right to refuse a
partial withdrawal if it would reduce the surrender value or the Total Sum
Insured below certain minimum amounts.



Policy Loans



You may borrow from your policy at any time by completing the appropriate
form. The minimum amount of each loan is $1,000. The maximum amount you can
borrow is determined by a formula. Interest is charged on each loan. You can pay
the interest or allow it to become part of the outstanding loan balance. You can
repay all or part of a loan at any time. If there is an outstanding loan when
the insured person dies, it will be deducted from the death benefit. Outstanding
loans are also deducted from your account value in order to determine your
account value.



Optional Benefit Riders



When you apply for the policy, you can request any of the optional benefit
riders that we make available. There are a number of such riders. Charges for
most riders will be deducted monthly from the policy's account value.



Investment Options



The policy offers a number of investment options, as listed on the cover of
this prospectus. They cover a broad spectrum of investment styles and
strategies. Although the funds of the Series Funds that underly those investment
options operate like publicly traded mutual funds, there are important
differences between your investment options and publicly-traded mutual funds. On
the plus side, you can transfer money from one investment option to another
without tax liability. Moreover, any dividends and capital gains distributed by
each underlying fund are automatically reinvested and reflected in the fund's
value and create no taxable event for you. On the negative side, if and when
policy earnings are distributed (generally as a result of a surrender or partial
withdrawal), they will be treated as ordinary income instead of as capital
gains. Also, you must keep in mind that you are purchasing an insurance policy
and you will be assessed charges at the policy level as well as at the fund
level. Such policy level charges are significant and will reduce the investment
performance of your investment options.



SUMMARY OF POLICY RISKS




Lapse Risk



If the account value of your policy is insufficient to pay the charges when
due, your policy (or part of it) can terminate (i.e. "lapse"). This can happen
because you haven't paid enough premiums or because the investment performance
of the investment options you've chosen has been poor or because of a
combination of both factors. You'll be given a "grace period" within which to
make additional premium payments to keep the policy in effect. If lapse occurs,
you'll be given the opportunity to reinstate the policy by making the required
premium payments and satisfying certain other conditions.





Investment Risk



As mentioned above, the investment performance of any variable investment
option may be good or bad. Your account value will rise or fall based on the
investment performance of the variable investment options you've chosen. Some
variable investment options are riskier than others. These risks (and potential
rewards) are discussed in detail in the attached prospectuses of the Series
Funds.



Access to Funds Risk



There is a risk that you will not be able (or willing) to access your
account value by surrendering the policy because of the contingent deferred
sales charge ("CDSC") that may be payable upon surrender. The CDSC is a
percentage of the premiums you've paid and disappears only after 14 policy years
have passed. See the "Fee Tables" section of this prospectus for details on the
CDSC. There is also a charge for each partial withdrawal you make. It is the
lesser of $20 or 2% of the withdrawal


4





amount. Any communication that arrives on a date that is not a business day will
be processd on the business day next following that date. The term "business
day" is defined on page XX.



Transfer Risk



There is a risk that you will not be able to transfer your account value
from one investment option to another because of limitations on the dollar
amount or frequency of transfers you can make. The limitation on transfers out
of the fixed account are more restrictive than those that apply to transfers out
of variable investment options.



Tax Risks



In order for you to receive the tax benefits accorded life insurance under
the Internal Revenue Code, your policy must comply with certain requirements of
the Code. We will monitor your policy for compliance with these requirements,
but a policy might fail to qualify as life insurance in spite of our monitoring.
If this were to occur, you would be subject to income tax on the income credited
to your policy for the period of disqualification and all subsequent periods.
The tax laws also contain a so-called "7 pay limit" that limits the amount of
premium that can be paid in relation to the policy's death benefit. If the limit
is violated, the policy will be treated as a "modified endowment", which can
have adverse tax consequences. There are also certain Treasury Department rules
referred to as the "investor control rules" that determine whether you would be
treated as the "owner" of the assets underlying your policy. If that were
determined to be the case, you would be taxed on any income or gains those
assets generate. In other words you would lose the value of the so-called
"inside build-up" that is a major benefit of life insurance.


There is also a tax risk associated with policy loans. Although no part of
a loan is treated as income to you when the loan is made, surrender or lapse of
the policy would result in the loan being treated as a distribution at the time
of lapse or surrender. This could result in a considerable tax bill. Under
certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans and an
insured person of advanced age, you might find yourself having to choose between
high premium requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax
burden if you allow the lapse to occur.


Tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal,
state and local estate, inheritance, gift and other tax laws can vary greatly
depending upon the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary. There can also be
unfavorable tax consequences on such things as the change of policy ownership or
assignment of ownership interests. For these and all the other reasons mentioned
above, we recommend you consult with a qualified tax adviser before buying the
policy and before exercising certain rights under the policy.

FEE TABLES



This section contains five tables that describe all of the fees and
expenses that you will pay when buying, owning and surrendering the policy. In
the first three tables, certain entries show the minimum charge, the maximum
charge and the charge for a representative insured person. Other entries show
only the maximum charge we can assess and are labeled as such. The remaining
entries are always calculated in the same way, so we cannot assess a charge that
is greater than the charge shown in the table.


The first table below describes the fees and expenses that you will pay at
the time that you buy the policy, surrender the policy, or transfer account
value between investment options.

                            not less than 12
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








* The CDSC percentage decreases in later policy years as follows: for policy
year 2, it is 93%; for policy year 3, it is 86%; for policy year 4, it is
79%; for policy year 5, it is 71%; for policy year 6, it is 64%; for
policy year 7, it is 57%; for policy year 8, it is 50%; for policy year 9,
it is 43%; for policy year 10, it is 36%; for policy year 11, it is 29%;
for policy year 12, it is 21%; for policy year 13, it is 14%; for policy
year 14, it is 7%; and for policy years 15 and later, it is 0%. The
"Target Premium" for each policy year is determined at the time the policy
is ussed and appears in the "Policy Specifications" section of the policy.
In general, the greater the proportion of Additional Sum Insured at issue,
the lower the Target Premium.


** This charge is not currently imposed, but we reserve the right to do so in
the policy.

The next two tables describe the fees and expenses that you will pay
periodically during the time you own the policy. These tables do not include
fees and expenses paid at the fund level. Except for the Optional Enhanced Cash
Value Rider, all of the charges shown in the tables are deducted from your
account value. The second table is devoted only to optional rider benefits.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








*  The insurance charge is determined by multiplying the amount of
insurance for which we are at risk (the amount at risk or "AAR") by the
applicable cost of insurance rate. The rates vary widely depending upon
the Total Sum Insured, the length of time the policy has been in effect,
the insurance risk characteristics of the insured persons and
(generally) the gender of the insured persons. The "minimum" rate shown
in the table is the rate in the first policy year for a $250,000 policy
issued to cover two 20 year old female preferred non-tobacco
underwriting risks. The "maximum" rate shown in the table is the rate in
the 25th policy year for a $500,000 policy issued to cover two 75 year
old male substandard tobacco underwriting risks. This includes the
so-called "extra mortality charge." The "representative insured persons"
referred to in the table are a 55 year old male preferred non-tobacco
underwriting risk and a 50 year old female preferred non-tobacco
underwriting risk. The charges shown in the table may not be
particularly relevant to your current situation. For more information
about cost of insurance rates, talk to your JHVLICO representative.


**  The issue charge varies depending upon the proportion of Additional Sum
Insured at issue. The amount quoted in the table assumes the minimum
proportion of Additional Sum Insured.


***  This charge only applies to that portion of account value held in the
variable investment options. The charge does not apply to the fixed
investment option.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








*  The charge for this rider is determined by multiplying the Term Death
Benefit under the rider by the applicable rate. The rates vary by the
issue age, gender and insurance risk characteristics of the insured
persons. The "minimum" rate shown in the table is for two 20 year old
female preferred non-tobacco underwriting risks. The "maximum" rate
shown in the table is for two 65 year old male substandard tobacco
underwriting risks. The "representative insured persons" referred to in
the table are a 55 year old male preferred non-tobacco underwriting risk
and a 50 year old female preferred non-tobacco underwriting risk.

Series Trust I when the fund's "other fund expenses" exceed 0.10% of the
fund's average daily net assets. The agreements are expected to remain in
effect until May 1, 2004, and may be renewed each year thereafter by the
John Hancock Variable Series Trust I. See the prospectuses for the Series
Funds for information on other reimbursement or waiver arrangements
affecting the funds.

DETAILED INFORMATION



This section of the prospectus provides additional detailed information that is
not contained in the Summary of Benefits and Risks section on pages XX through
XX.



DESCRIPTION OF JHVLICO



We are JHVLICO, a stock life insurance company chartered in 1979 under
Massachusetts law, with its home office at 197 Clarendon Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, 02117. We are authorized to transact a life insurance and annuity
business in all states other than New York and in the District of Columbia. We
began selling variable life insurance policies in 1980.


We are regulated and supervised by the Massachusetts Commissioner of
Insurance, who periodically examines our affairs. We also are subject to the
applicable insurance laws and regulations of all jurisdictions in which we are
authorized to do business. We are required to submit annual statements of our
operations, including financial statements, to the insurance departments of the
various jurisdictions in which we do business for purposes of determining
solvency and compliance with local insurance laws and regulations. The
regulation to which we are subject, however, does not provide a guarantee as to
such matters.


We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of John Hancock Life Insurance Company
("John Hancock"), a Massachusetts stock life insurance company. On February 1,
2000, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (which was chartered in
Massachusetts in 1862) converted to a stock company by "demutualizing" and
changed its name to John Hancock Life Insurance Company. As part of the
demutualization process, John Hancock became a subsidiary of John Hancock
Financial Services, Inc., a newly formed publicly-traded corporation. John
Hancock's home office is at John Hancock Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02117. As
of December 31, 2002, John Hancock's assets were approximately $81 billion and
it had invested approximately $575 million in JHVLICO in connection with
JHVLICO's organization and operation. It is anticipated that John Hancock will
from time to time make additional capital contributions to JHVLICO to enable us
to meet our reserve requirements and expenses in connection with our business.
John Hancock is committed to make additional capital contributions if necessary
to ensure that we maintain a positive net worth.



DESCRIPTION OF JOHN HANCOCK VARIABLE LIFE ACCOUNT S



The variable investment options shown on page 1 are in fact subaccounts of
John Hancock Variable Life Account S (the "Account"), a separate account
established by us under Massachusetts law. The Account meets the definition of
"separate account" under the Federal securities laws and is registered as a unit
investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act"). Such
registration does not involve supervision by the SEC of the management of the
Account or of us.


The Account's assets are our property. Each policy provides that amounts we
hold in the Account pursuant to the policies cannot be reached by any other
persons who may have claims against us and can't be used to pay any indebtedness
of John Hancock other than those arising out of policies that use the Account.


New subaccounts may be added and made available to policy owners from time
to time. Existing subaccounts may be modified or deleted at any time.



DESCRIPTION OF THE UNDERLYING FUNDS



The variable investment options shown on page 1 are those available as of
the date of this prospectus. The options are grouped as to "type" on page 1.
When you select one or more of these variable investment options, we invest your
money in the selected subaccounts of the Account. In turn, the assets of the
subaccounts are invested in the corresponding investment option(s) of one or
more of the following: the John Hancock Variable Series Trust I, the John
Hancock Declaration Trust, the AIM Variable Insurance Funds, Fidelity's Variable
Insurance Products Fund (Service Class) and Variable Insurance Products Fund II
(Service Class), the MFS Variable Insurance Trust (Initial Class Shares), and
the Janus Aspen Series (Service Shares Class) (together, "the Series Funds"). In
this prospectus, the investment options of the Series Funds are referred to as
"funds". In the prospectuses for the Series Funds, the investment options may be
referred to as "funds", "portfolios" or "series".

The fund manager shown on page 1 for any given fund may be the investment
advisor for the fund or a sub-investment advisor. However, in each case, the
entity shown is the one that actually manages the fund's assets. For example,
the investment advisor for all funds of the John Hancock Variable Series Trust I
is John Hancock Life Insurance Company. The entities shown on page 1 for those
funds are sub-investment advisors. For all the other funds, you should consult
the appropriate Series Fund prospectus to determine whether the entity shown on
page 1 is the investment advisor or a sub-investment advisor.


Each Series Fund is a so-called "series" type mutual fund registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The investment results of each
variable investment option you select will depend on those of the corresponding
fund of one of the Series Funds. Each of the funds is separately managed and has
its own investment objective and strategies. Attached at the end of this
prospectus are prospectuses for the Series Funds. The Series Fund prospectuses
contain detailed information about each available fund. Be sure to read those
prospectuses before selecting any of the variable investment options shown on
page 1.


We will purchase and redeem Series Fund shares for the Account at their net
asset value without any sales or redemption charges. Shares of a Series Fund
represent an interest in one of the funds of the Series Fund which corresponds
to a subaccount of the Account. Any dividend or capital gains distributions
received by the Account will be reinvested in shares of that same fund at their
net asset value as of the dates paid.


On each business day, shares of each fund are purchased or redeemed by us
for each subaccount based on, among other things, the amount of net premiums
allocated to the subaccount, distributions reinvested, and transfers to, from
and among subaccounts, all to be effected as of that date. Such purchases and
redemptions are effected at each fund's net asset value per share determined for
that same date. A "business day" is any date on which the New York Stock
Exchange is open for trading. We compute policy values for each business day as
of the close of that day (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time).


Voting privileges that you will have


All of the assets in the subaccounts of the Account are invested in shares
of the corresponding funds of the Series Funds. We will vote the shares of each
of the funds of a Series Fund which are deemed attributable to variable life
insurance policies at regular and special meetings of the Series Fund's
shareholders in accordance with instructions received from owners of such
policies. Shares of the Series Fund held in the Account which are not
attributable to such policies, as well as shares for which instructions from
owners are not received, will be represented by us at the meeting. We will vote
such shares for and against each matter in the same proportions as the votes
based upon the instructions received from the owners of such policies.


We determine the number of a fund's shares held in a subaccount
attributable to each owner by dividing the amount of a policy's account value
held in the subaccount by the net asset value of one share in the fund.
Fractional votes will be counted. We determine the number of shares as to which
the owner may give instructions as of the record date for a Series Fund's
meeting. Owners of policies may give instructions regarding the election of the
Board of Trustees or Board of Directors of a Series Fund, ratification of the
selection of independent auditors, approval of Series Fund investment advisory
agreements and other matters requiring a shareholder vote. We will furnish
owners with information and forms to enable owners to give voting instructions.


However, we may, in certain limited circumstances permitted by the SEC's
rules, disregard voting instructions. If we do disregard voting instructions,
you will receive a summary of that action and the reasons for it in the next
semi-annual report to owners.



Changes we can make to a Series Fund or the Account



The voting privileges described above reflect our understanding of
applicable Federal securities law requirements. To the extent that applicable
law, regulations or interpretations change to eliminate or restrict the need for
such voting privileges, we reserve the right to proceed in accordance with any
such revised requirements. We also reserve the right, subject to compliance with
applicable law, including approval of owners if so required, (1) to transfer
assets determined by JHVLICO to be associated with the class of policies to
which your policy belongs from the Account to another separate account or
subaccount, (2) to operate the Account as a "management-type investment company"
under the 1940 Act, or in any other form permitted by law, the investment
adviser of which would be JHVLICO, John Hancock or an affiliate of either, (3)
to deregister the Account under the 1940 Act, (4) to substitute for the fund
shares held by a subaccount any other investment permitted by law, and (5) to
take


12





any action necessary to comply with or obtain any exemptions from the 1940 Act.
Any such change will be made only if, in our judgement, the change would best
serve the interests of owners of policies in your policy class or would be
appropriate in carrying out the purposes of such policies. We would notify
owners of any of the foregoing changes and, to the extent legally required,
obtain approval of affected owners and any regulatory body prior thereto. Such
notice and approval, however, may not be legally required in all cases.



THE FIXED INVESTMENT OPTION



Our obligations under the policy's fixed investment option are backed by
our general account assets. Our general account consists of assets owned by us
other than those in the Account and in other separate accounts that we may
establish. Subject to applicable law, we have sole discretion over the
investment of assets of the general account and policy owners do not share in
the investment experience of, or have any preferential claim on, those assets.
Instead, we guarantee that the account value allocated to the fixed investment
option will accrue interest daily at an effective annual rate of at least 4%
without regard to the actual investment experience of the general account.


Because of exemptive and exclusionary provisions, interests in our fixed
investment option have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and
our general account has not been registered as an investment company under the
1940 Act. Accordingly, neither the general account nor any interests therein are
subject to the provisions of these acts, and we have been advised that the staff
of the SEC has not reviewed the disclosure in this prospectus relating to the
fixed investment option. Disclosure regarding the fixed investment option may,
however, be subject to certain generally-applicable provisions of the Federal
securities laws relating to accuracy and completeness of statements made in
prospectuses.



PREMIUMS




Planned Premiums



The Policy Specifications page of your policy will show the "Planned
Premium" for the policy. You choose this amount in the policy application. You
will also choose how often to pay premiums-- annually, semi-annually, quarterly
or monthly. The premium reminder notice we send you is based on the amount and
period you choose. However, payment of Planned Premiums is not necessarily
required. You need only invest enough to keep the policy in force (see "Lapse
and reinstatement" on page XX).


Maximum premium payments


Federal tax law limits the amount of premium payments you can make relative
to the amount of your policy's insurance coverage. We will not knowingly accept
any amount by which a premium payment exceeds the maximum. If you exceed certain
other limits, the law may impose a penalty on amounts you take out of your
policy. More discussion of these tax law requirements begins on page XX. Also,
we may refuse to accept any amount of an additional premium if:


. that amount of premium would increase our insurance risk exposure, and


. the insured persons don't provide us with adequate evidence that he or
she continues to meet our requirements for issuing insurance.


In no event, however, will we refuse to accept any premium necessary to
prevent the policy from terminating or to keep the guaranteed death benefit
feature in effect.


Ways to pay premiums


If you pay premiums by check or money order, they must be drawn on a U.S.
bank in U.S. dollars and made payable to "John Hancock Life." We will not accept
credit card checks. We will not accept starter or third party checks if they
fail to satisfy our administrative requirements. Premiums after the first must
be sent to the JHVLICO Life Servicing Office at the appropriate address shown on
page XX of this prospectus.


13





We will also accept premiums:


. by wire or by exchange from another insurance company,


. via an electronic funds transfer program (any owner interested in making
monthly premium payments must use this method), or


. if we agree to it, through a salary deduction plan with your employer.


You can obtain information on these other methods of premium payment by
contacting your JHVLICO representative or by contacting the JHVLICO Life
Servicing Office.


Processing premium payments


We will process any premium payment as of the day we receive it, unless one
of the following exceptions applies:


(1) We will process a payment received prior to a policy's date of issue as
if received on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue.


(2) If the Minimum Initial Premium is not received prior to the date of
issue, we will process each premium payment received thereafter as if received
on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue until all of the
Minimum Initial Premium is received.


(3) We will process the portion of any premium payment for which we require
evidence of the insured person's continued insurability only after we have
received such evidence and found it satisfactory to us.


(4) If we receive any premium payment that we think will cause a policy to
become a modified endowment or will cause a policy to lose its status as life
insurance under the tax laws, we will not accept the excess portion of that
premium payment and will immediately notify the owner. We will refund the excess
premium when the premium payment check has had time to clear the banking system
(but in no case more than two weeks after receipt), except in the following
circumstances:


. The tax problem resolves itself prior to the date the refund is to be
made; or


. The tax problem relates to modified endowment status and we receive a
signed acknowledgment from the owner prior to the refund date
instructing
us to process the premium notwithstanding the tax issues involved.


In the above cases, we will treat the excess premium as having been received on
the date the tax problem resolves itself or the date we receive the signed
acknowledgment. We will then process it accordingly.


(5) If a premium payment is received or is otherwise scheduled to be
processed (as specified above) on a date that is not a business day, the premium
payment will be processed on the business day next following that date.



LAPSE AND REINSTATEMENT



Either your entire policy or the Additional Sum Insured portion of your
Total Sum Insured can terminate (i.e., "lapse") for failure to pay charges due
under the policy. During the first 5 policy years, there can be no lapse of any
kind if the guaranteed death benefit feature is in effect (see below). If the
guaranteed death benefit feature is in effect after the 5th policy year, the
Additional Sum Insured and any additional benefit riders (unless otherwise
stated therein) will be in default may lapse if the policy's surrender value is
not sufficient to pay the charges on a grace period testing date. If the
guaranteed death benefit feature is not in effect, the entire policy will be in
default may lapse if the policy's surrender value is not sufficient to pay the
charges on a grace period testing date. In either case, we will notify you of
how much you will need to pay to keep the Additional Sum Insured or the policy
in force. You will have a 61 day "grace period" to make these payments. If you
pay these amounts during the grace period, you may also continue the guaranteed
death benefit feature by paying the necessary amount of GDB Premiums.


If you don't pay at least the required amount by the end of the grace
period, the Additional Sum Insured and any additional benefit riders (unless
otherwise stated therein) or your policy, as the case may be, will lapse. If
your policy lapses, all coverage under the policy will cease. Even if the policy
or the Additional Sum Insured terminates in this way, you can still reactivate
(i.e.,


14





"reinstate") it within 3 years from the beginning of the grace period. You will
have to provide evidence that the insured person still meets our requirements
for issuing coverage. You will also have to pay a minimum amount of premium and
be subject to the other terms and conditions applicable to reinstatements, as
specified in the policy. Reinstatement of a lapsed policy or Additional Sum
Insured will take effect on the monthly deduction date on or next following the
date we approve the reinstatement request.


If the guaranteed death benefit is not in effect and the last surviving
insured person dies during the grace period, we will deduct any unpaid monthly
charges from the death benefit. During a grace period, you cannot make a partial
withdrawal or policy loan.


Guaranteed death benefit feature


This feature guarantees that your Basic Sum Insured will not terminate
(i.e., "lapse"), regardless of adverse investment performance, if on each "grace
period testing date" the amount of cumulative premiums you have paid (less all
withdrawals from the policy and all outstanding loans) equals or exceeds the sum
of all Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium ("GDB Premium") due to date. For the
first 5 policy years, the same applies to any amount of Additional Sum Insured.
If the Guaranteed Death Benefit test is not satisfied on any grace period
testing date, the guaranteed death benefit feature will not be "in effect" on
that date. We currently test on a quarterly basis, but reserve the right to test
on each monthly deduction date. (The term " monthly deduction date" is defined
on page XX under "Procedures for issuance of a policy".)


Your policy will show two types of GDB Premium (or such other types as
permitted by your state):


. 5 Year GDB Premium - This is used on each grace period testing date
until the 5th policy anniversary. The total GDB Premium that is "due to
date" on any grace period testing date during this period is equal to
the 5 Year GDB Premium times the number of elapsed policy months from
the policy's date of issue through the grace period testing date.


. Age 100 GDB Premium - This is used on each grace period testing date
that occurs on and after the 5th policy anniversary until the policy
anniversary nearest the younger insured person's 100th birthday
(regardless of whether such younger insured person remains alive until
that policy anniversary). The total GDB Premium that is "due to date" on
any grace period testing date during this period is equal to the Age 100
GDB Premium times the number of elapsed policy months from the policy's
date of issue through the grace period testing date.


The Age 100 GDB Premium is higher than the 5 Year GDB Premium, but neither
of them will ever be greater than the so-called "guideline premium" for the
policy as defined in Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code.


For the first 5 policy years, the guaranteed death benefit feature applies
to both the Basic Sum Insured and Additional Sum Insured then in effect and any
riders then in effect. On the 5th policy anniversary and there after, the
guaranteed death benefit feature applies only to the Basic Sum Insured in effect
when we issue the policy and does not apply to any amount of Additional Sum
Insured or any rider benefits. If you increase the Total Sum Insured (see "How
much will we pay when the last insured person dies?" on page XX), the guaranteed
death benefit feature will cease to be in effect on the date such increase takes
effect or the 5th policy anniversary, whichever is later. If there is a decrease
in the Total Sum Insured or a change in death benefit option, the 5 Year GDB
Premium and the Age 100 GDB Premium may be changed. In making any "due date"
calculation described above after the effective date of the change, the old GDB
Premium will apply up to the effective date of the change and the new GDB
Premium will be multiplied by the number of elapsed policy months from the
effective date of the change through the grace period testing date.


If there are monthly charges that remain unpaid because of this guaranteed
death benefit feature, we will deduct such charges when there is sufficient
account value to pay them.


If an insufficient amount of GDB Premium has been paid on a grace period
testing date, and your policy would lapse for failure to pay charges then due,
we will provide you with a notification as described in the next section, "Lapse
and reinstatement".

THE DEATH BENEFIT



In your application for the policy, you will tell us how much life
insurance coverage you want on the lives of the insured persons. This is called
the "Total Sum Insured." Total Sum Insured is composed of the Basic Sum Insured
and any Additional Sum Insured you elect. The maximum amount of Additional Sum
Insured you can have when we issue the policy is generally limited to 400% of
the Basic Sum Insured. The application may also give you the option of electing
among various patterns of scheduled increases in Additional Sum Insured. There
are a number of factors you should consider in determining whether to elect
coverage in the form of Basic Sum Insured or in the form of Additional Sum
Insured. These factors are discussed under "Basic Sum Insured vs. Additional Sum
Insured" on page XX.


When the last of the insured persons dies, we will pay the death benefit
minus any outstanding loans. There are two ways of calculating the death
benefit. You must choose which one you want in the application. The two death
benefit options are:


. Option A - The death benefit will equal the greater of (1) the Total Sum
Insured plus any optional extra death benefit, if elected (as described
below), or (2) the minimum insurance amount (as described below).


. Option B - The death benefit will equal the greater of (1) the Total Sum
Insured plus your policy's account value on the date of death of the
last surviving insured person, or (2) the minimum insurance amount.


For the same premium payments, the death benefit under Option B will tend
to be higher than the death benefit under Option A. On the other hand, the
monthly insurance charge will be higher under Option B to compensate us for the
additional insurance risk. Because of that, the account value will tend to be
higher under Option A than under Option B for the same premium payments.


Limitations on payment of death benefit


If the insured person commits suicide within certain time periods, the
amount of death benefit we pay will be limited as described in the policy. Also,
if an application misstated the age or gender of the insured person, we will
adjust the amount of any death benefit as described in the policy.



Basic Sum Insured vs. Additional Sum Insured



As noted earlier in this prospectus, you should consider a number of
factors in determining whether to elect coverage in the form of Basic Sum
Insured or in the form of Additional Sum Insured.


For the same amount of premiums paid, the amount of the issue charge
deducted from account value and the amount of compensation paid to the selling
insurance agent will generally be less if coverage is included as Additional Sum
Insured, rather than as Basic Sum Insured. On the other hand, the amount of any
Additional Sum Insured is not included in the guaranteed death benefit feature
after the 5th policy year and is not extended beyond the age 100 adjustment
date. (The "age 100 adjustment date" is defined under "When the younger insured
person reaches 100" on page XX). Therefore, if the policy's surrender value is
insufficient to pay the monthly charges as they fall due (including the charges
for the Additional Sum Insured) after the 5th policy year, the Additional Sum
Insured coverage will lapse, even if the Basic Sum Insured stays in effect
pursuant to the guaranteed death benefit feature.


Generally, you will incur lower issue charges and have more flexible
coverage with respect to the Additional Sum Insured than with respect to the
Basic Sum Insured. If this is your priority, you may wish to maximize the
proportion of the Additional Sum Insured. However, if your priority is to take
advantage of the guaranteed death benefit feature after the 5th policy year the
proportion of the Policy's Total Sum Insured that is guaranteed can be increased
by taking out more coverage as Basic Sum Insured at the time of policy issuance.
In addition, the death benefit after the age 100 adjustment date will generally
be larger if the proportion of Basic Sum Insured immediately prior to that date
is larger.


Any decision you make to modify the amount of Additional Sum Insured
coverage after issue can have significant tax consequences (see "Tax
Considerations" beginning on page XX).


16





The minimum insurance amount


In order for a policy to qualify as life insurance under Federal tax law,
there has to be a minimum amount of insurance in relation to account value.
There are two tests that can be applied under Federal tax law -- the "guideline
premium and cash value corridor test" and the "cash value accumulation test."
When you elect the death benefit option, you must also elect which test you wish
to have applied. As indicated above, the guideline premium and cash value
corridor test is not available if the optional extra death benefit feature is
elected. Under the guideline premium and cash value corridor test, we compute
the minimum insurance amount each business day by multiplying the account value
on that date by the death benefit factor (called "corridor factor" in the
policy) applicable on that date. In this case, the factors are derived by
applying the guideline premium and cash value corridor test. The factor starts
out at 2.50 for ages at or below 40 and decreases as attained age increases,
reaching a low of 1.0 at age 95. A table showing the factor for each age will
appear in the policy. Under the cash value accumulation test, we compute the
minimum insurance amount each business day by multiplying the account value on
that date by the death benefit factor applicable on that date. In this case, the
factors are derived by applying the cash value accumulation test. The factor
decreases as attained age increases. A table showing the factor for each age
will appear in the policy. Regardless of which test is applied, the appropriate
factor will be referred to in the policy as the "Required Additional Death
Benefit Factor."


As noted above, you have to elect which test will be applied if you elect
the Option A death benefit. The cash value accumulation test may be preferable
if you want an increasing death benefit in later policy years and/or want to
fund the policy at the "7 pay" limit for the full 7 years (see "Tax
Considerations" beginning on page XX). The guideline premium and cash value
corridor test may be preferable if you want the account value under the policy
to increase without increasing the death benefit as quickly as might otherwise
be required.


When the younger insured person reaches 100


If the policy is still in effect on the policy anniversary nearest the
100th birthday of the younger of the two insured persons, the following things
will happen whether or not the younger insured person is actually alive on that
policy anniversary:


. We will stop deducting any monthly charges (other than the asset-based
risk charge) and will stop accepting any premium payments.


. The death benefit will become equal to the Basic Sum Insured plus a
percentage of the account value on the date of death of the last
surviving insured person. The percentage will be equal to the ratio of
Additional Sum Insured to Total Sum Insured on the day immediately
preceding the age 100 adjustment date. Death benefit Options A and B (as
described above) and the guaranteed minimum death benefit feature will
all cease to apply.


Requesting an increase in coverage


You may request an increase in the Additional Sum Insured. As to when such
an increase would take effect, see "Effective date of other policy transactions"
on page XX). Generally, each such increase must be at least $50,000. However,
you will have to provide us with evidence that the insured person still meets
our requirements for issuing insurance coverage. Unless we consent otherwise,
you may not increase the Additional Sum Insured if the increase would cause the
entire Additional Sum Insured to equal or exceed 800% of the Basic Sum Insured.


Requesting a decrease in coverage


After the first policy year, you may request a reduction in the Total Sum
Insured, but only if:


. the remaining Basic Sum Insured will be at least $250,000, and


. the remaining Additional Sum Insured will not exceed 800% of the Basic
Sum Insured, and


. the remaining Total Sum Insured will at least equal the minimum required
by the tax laws to maintain the policy's life insurance status.


We may refuse any decrease in Additional Sum Insured if it would cause the
death benefit to increase pursuant to the optional extra death benefit feature.
As to when any reduction in Total Sum Insured would take effect, see "Effective
date of other policy transactions" on page XX. Any reduction in Total Sum
Insured will be implemented by first reducing any


17





Additional Sum Insured. If there is any reduction in Basic Sum Insured, a
pro-rata portion of the applicable CDSC will be deducted from the account value
(see "Contingent deferred sales charge (`CDSC')" on page XX).


Change of death benefit option


You may change your coverage from death benefit Option B to Option A on any
policy anniversary, but only if there is no change in the Federal tax law test
used to determine the minimum insurance amount. A change from death benefit
Option A to Option B is not permitted under our administrative rules.


Please read "The minimum insurance amount" on page XX for more information
about the "guideline premium and cash value corridor test" and the "cash value
accumulation test."


Effective date of other policy transactions


The following transactions take effect on the policy anniversary on or next
following the date we approve your request:


. Total Sum Insured decreases


. Additional Sum Insured increases


A change of death benefit Option from B to A is effective on the policy
anniversary on or next following the date we receive the request.


Tax consequences of coverage changes


Please read "Tax considerations" starting on page XX to learn about
possible tax consequences of changing your insurance coverage under the policy.


Your beneficiary


You name your beneficiary when you apply for the policy. The beneficiary is
entitled to the proceeds we pay following the death of the last surviving
insured person. You may change the beneficiary during that insured person's
lifetime. Such a change requires the consent of any irrevocable named
beneficiary. A new beneficiary designation is effective as of the date you sign
it, but will not affect any payments we make before we receive it. If no
beneficiary is living when the last surviving insured person dies, we will pay
the insurance proceeds to the owner or the owner's estate.


Ways in which we pay out policy proceeds


You may choose to receive proceeds from the policy as a single sum. This
includes proceeds that become payable because of death or full surrender.
Alternatively, you can elect to have proceeds of $1,000 or more applied to any
of a number of other payment options, including the following:


. Option 1 - Proceeds left with us to accumulate with interest


. Option 2A - Equal monthly payments of a specified amount until all
proceeds are paid out


. Option 2B - Equal monthly payments for a specified period of time


. Option 3 - Equal monthly payments for life, but with payments guaranteed
for a specific number of years


. Option 4 - Equal monthly payments for life with no refund


. Option 5 - Equal monthly payments for life with a refund if all of the
proceeds haven't been paid out


You cannot choose an option if the monthly payments under the option would
be less than $50. We will issue a supplementary agreement when the proceeds are
applied to any alternative payment option. That agreement will spell out the
terms of the option in full. We will credit interest on each of the above
options. For Options 1 and 2A, the interest will be at least an effective annual
rate of 3.50%. If no alternative payment option has been chosen, proceeds will
be paid as a single sum.


18





Changing a payment option


You can change the payment option at any time before the proceeds are
payable. If you haven't made a choice, the payee of the proceeds has a
prescribed period in which he or she can make that choice.


Tax impact of payment option chosen


There may be tax consequences to you or your beneficiary depending upon
which payment option is chosen. You should consult with a qualified tax adviser
before making that choice.



THE ACCOUNT VALUE



From each premium payment you make, we deduct the charges described under
"Deductions from premium payments" below. We invest the rest in the investment
options you've elected. Special investment rules apply to premiums processed
prior to the 20th day after your policy becomes effective. (See "Commencement of
investment performance" beginning on page XX).


Over time, the amount you've invested in any variable investment option
will increase or decrease the same as if you had invested the same amount
directly in the corresponding fund of a Series Fund and had reinvested all fund
dividends and distributions in additional fund shares; except that we will
deduct certain additional charges which will reduce your account value. We
describe these charges under "Description of Charges at the Policy Level"
beginning on page XX.


The amount you've invested in the fixed investment option will earn
interest at a rate we declare from time to time. We guarantee that this rate
will be at least 4%. If you want to know what the current declared rate is, just
call or write to us. Amounts you invest in the fixed investment option will not
be subject to the asset-based risk charge described on page XX. Otherwise, the
charges applicable to the fixed investment option are the same as those
applicable to the variable investment options.


Commencement of investment performance


Any premium payment processed prior to the twentieth day after the policy's
date of issue will automatically be allocated to the Money Market investment
option. On the later of the date such payment is received or the twentieth day
following the date of issue, the portion of the Money Market investment option
attributable to such payment will be reallocated automatically among the
investment options you have chosen.


All other premium payments will be allocated among the investment options
you have chosen as soon as they are processed.


Allocation of future premium payments


At any time, you may change the investment options in which future premium
payments will be invested. You make the original allocation in the application
for the policy. The percentages you select must be in whole numbers and must
total 100%.


Transfers of existing account value


You may also transfer your existing account value from one investment
option to another. To do so, you must tell us how much to transfer, either as a
whole number percentage or as a specific dollar amount. A confirmation of each
transfer will be sent to you. Without our approval, the maximum amount you may
transfer to or from any investment option in any policy year is $1,000,000.


Under our current rules, you can make transfers out of any variable
investment option anytime you wish. However, we reserve the right to impose
limits on the number and frequency of transfers into and out of variable
investment options and to impose a charge of up to $25 for any transfer beyond
an annual limit (which will not be less than 12). Transfers under the dollar
cost averaging program would not be counted toward any such limit.


Transfers out of the fixed investment option are currently subject to the
following restrictions:


19





.   You can only make such a transfer once in each policy year.


.   Any transfer request received within 6 months of the last transfer out
of the fixed investment option will not be processed until such 6
month period has expired.


.   The most you can transfer at any one time is the greater of (i) $500

(ii) 20% of the assets in your fixed investment option or (iii) the
amount transferred out of your fixed investment option during the
previous policy year.


We reserve the right to impose limits on: the minimum amount of each
transfer out of the fixed investment option and the maximum amount of any
transfer into the fixed investment option after the second policy year.


Dollar cost averaging


This is a program of automatic monthly transfers out of the Money Market
investment option into one or more of the other variable investment options. You
choose the investment options and the dollar amount and timing of the transfers.
The program is designed to reduce the risks that result from market
fluctuations. It does this by spreading out the allocation of your money to
investment options over a longer period of time. This allows you to reduce the
risk of investing most of your money at a time when market prices are high.
Obviously, the success of this strategy depends on market trends and is not
guaranteed.


Scheduled transfers under this option may be made from the Money Market
investment option to not more than nine other variable investment options.
However, the amount transferred to any one investment option must be at least
$100.


Once we receive the election in form satisfactory to us at our Life
Servicing Office, transfers will begin on the second monthly deduction date
following its receipt. If you have any questions with respect to this provision,
call 1-800-732-5543.


Once elected, the scheduled monthly transfer option will remain in effect
for so long as you have at least $2,500 of your account value in the Money
Market investment option, or until we receive written notice from you of
cancellation of the option or notice of the death of the last surviving insured
person. The dollar cost averaging and rebalancing options cannot be in effect at
the same time. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or suspend the dollar
cost averaging program at any time.



SURRENDER AND PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS



Full surrender


You may surrender your policy in full at any time. If you do, we will pay
you the account value, less any policy loans and less any CDSC charge that then
applies. This is called your "surrender value." You must return your policy when
you request a full surrender. We process surrenders as of the day we receive the
surrender request.


Partial withdrawals


You may make a partial withdrawal of your surrender value at any time after
the first policy year. Each partial withdrawal must be at least $1,000. There is
a charge (usually $20) for each partial withdrawal. We will automatically reduce
the account value of your policy by the amount of the withdrawal and the related
charge. Unless we agree otherwise, each investment option will be reduced in the
same proportion as the account value is then allocated among them. We will not
permit a partial withdrawal if it would cause your surrender value to fall below
3 months' worth of monthly charges (see "Deductions from account value" on page

XX). We also reserve the right to refuse any partial withdrawal that would cause
the policy's Total Sum Insured to fall below $250,000 or the policy's Basic Sum
Insured to fall below $250,000. Under the Option A death benefit, the reduction
of your account value occasioned by a partial withdrawal could cause the minimum
insurance amount to become less than your Total Sum Insured (see "How much will
we pay when the insured person dies?" on page XX). If that happens, we will
automatically reduce your Total Sum Insured. The calculation of that reduction
is explained in the policy, and will be implemented by first reducing any
Additional Sum Insured in effect. If the reduction in Total Sum Insured would
cause your policy to fail the Internal Revenue Code's definition of life
insurance, we will not permit the partial withdrawal. If the withdrawal results
in a reduction in Basic Sum Insured, a pro-rata portion of the applicable CDSC
will be deducted from the account value (see "Contingent deferred sales charge
(`CDSC')" on page XX).

POLICY LOANS



You may borrow from your policy at any time by completing a form
satisfactory to us or, if the telephone transaction authorization form has been
completed, by telephone. The maximum amount you can borrow is determined as
follows:


.   We first determine the surrender value of your policy.


.   We then subtract an amount equal to 12 times the monthly charges then
being deducted from account value.


.   We then multiply the resulting amount by .75% in policy years 1
through 10, .50% in policy years 11 through 20, and 0% thereafter
(although we reserve the right to increase the percentage after policy
year 20 to as much as .25%).


.   We then subtract the third item above from the result of the second
item above.


The minimum amount of each loan is $1,000. The interest charged on any loan
is an effective annual rate of 4.75% in the first 10 policy years, 4.50% in
policy years 11 through 20, and 4.0% thereafter. However, we reserve the right
to increase the percentage after policy year 20 to as much as 4.25%. Accrued
interest will be added to the loan daily and will bear interest at the same rate
as the original loan amount. The amount of the loan is deducted from the
investment options in the same proportion as the account value is then allocated
among them and is placed in a special loan account. This special loan account
will earn interest at an effective annual rate of 4.0%. However, if we determine
that a loan will be treated as a taxable distribution because of the
differential between the loan interest rate and the rate being credited on the
special loan account, we reserve the right to decrease the rate credited on the
special loan account to a rate that would, in our reasonable judgement, result
in the transaction being treated as a loan under Federal tax law. We process
policy loans as of the day we receive the loan request.


Repayment of policy loans


You can repay all or part of a loan at any time. Unless we agree otherwise, each
repayment will be allocated among the investment options as follows:


.   The same proportionate part of the loan as was borrowed from the fixed
investment option will be repaid to the fixed investment option.


.   The remainder of the repayment will be allocated among the investment
options in the same way a new premium payment would be allocated.


If you want a payment to be used as a loan repayment, you must include
instructions to that effect. Otherwise, all payments will be assumed to be
premium payments. We process loan repayments as of the day we receive the
repayment.


Effects of policy loans


The account value, the surrender value, and any death benefit above the
Total Sum Insured are permanently affected by any loan, whether or not it is
repaid in whole or in part. This is because the amount of the loan is deducted
from the investment options and placed in a special loan account. The investment
options and the special loan account will generally have different rates of
investment return.


The amount of the outstanding loan (which includes accrued and unpaid
interest) is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy
proceeds become payable.


Whenever the outstanding loan equals or exceeds the surrender value, the
policy will terminate 31 days after we have mailed notice of termination to you
(and to any assignee of record at such assignee's last known address) specifying
the minimum amount that must be paid to avoid termination, unless a repayment of
at least the amount specified is made within


21





that period. Also, taking out a loan on the policy increases the risk that the
policy may lapse because of the difference between the interest rate charged on
the loan and the interest rate credited to the special loan account. Policy
loans may result in adverse tax consequences under certain circumstances (see
"Tax Considerations" beginning on page XX).



DESCRIPTION OF CHARGES AT THE POLICY LEVEL



Deductions from premium payments


.   Tax charge - A charge to cover state premium taxes we currently expect to
pay, on average, and the increased Federal income tax burden that we
currently expect will result from receipt of premiums. This charge is
currently 3.60% of each premium.


.   Premium sales charge - A charge to help defray our sales costs. The charge
is 5% of the premium you pay in all policy years. We currently intend to
stop making this charge on premiums received after the 10th policy year,
but this is not guaranteed. Because policies of this type were first
offered for sale in the year 2001, no termination of this charge has yet
occurred.


Deductions from account value


.   Issue charge - A monthly charge made for the first four policy years to
help defray our sales and administrative costs. Part of the charge is a
percentage of the "Target Premium" and will be the same regardless of the
amount of premium actually paid. The percentage will vary depending upon
the proportion of Additional Sum Insured at issue and will never be greater
than 1.833%. The Target Premium is determined at the time the policy is
issued and appears in the "Policy Specifications" section of the policy. In
general, the greater the proportion of Additional Sum Insured at issue, the
lower the Target Premium. The other part of the charge is an amount per
thousand of Basic Sum Insured at issue. This amount will vary depending
upon the proportion of Additional Sum Insured at issue and will never be
greater than 5c. In general, the greater the proportion of Additional Sum
Insured at issue, the lower the amount per thousand.


.   Maintenance charge - A monthly charge to help defray our administrative
costs. This is a flat dollar charge of up to $12 (currently $9) during all
policy years.


.   Insurance charge - A monthly charge for the cost of insurance. To determine
the charge, we multiply the amount of insurance for which we are at risk by
a cost of insurance rate. The rate is derived from an actuarial table and
the ratio of Basic Sum Insured to Additional Sum Insured on the date we
issue your policy. The table in your policy will show the maximum cost of
insurance rates. The cost of insurance rates that we currently apply are
generally less than the maximum rates. We will review the cost of insurance
rates at least every 5 years and may change them from time to time.
However, those rates will never be more than the maximum rates shown in the
policy. The table of rates we use will depend on the insurance risk
characteristics and (usually) gender of each of the insured persons, the
Total Sum Insured and the length of time the policy has been in effect.
Regardless of the table used, cost of insurance rates generally increase
each year that you own your policy, as each insured person's attained age
increases. (An insured person's "attained age" on any date is his or her
age on the birthday nearest that date.) The insurance charge is not
affected by the death of the first insured person to die. The insurance
charge for death benefit Option B will tend to be higher than the insurance
charge for death benefit Option A (see "How much will we pay when the last
insured person dies?" on page XX).


.   Extra mortality charge - A monthly charge specified in your policy for
additional mortality risk if either of the insured persons is subject to
certain types of special insurance risk.


.   Asset-based risk charge - A monthly charge for mortality and expense risks
we assume. The charge is a percentage of that portion of your account value
allocated to variable investment options. The current percentage on the
first $25,000 of account value allocated to variable investment options is
.0501%. We guarantee that this percentage will never exceed .0501%. The
current percentages on the account value allocated to the variable
investment options in excess of $25,000 are .0501% for policy years 1
through 10, .0167% for policy years 11 through 20, and .0083% for policy
years 21 and thereafter. We guarantee that these percentages will never
exceed .0501% for all policy years . This charge does not apply to the
fixed investment option.


.   Optional benefits charge - Monthly charges for certain optional insurance
benefits added to the policy by means of a rider. Some of the riders we
currently offer are described under "Can you add additional benefit
riders?" on page XX.


22





.   Contingent deferred sales charge ("CDSC") - A charge we deduct if the
policy lapses or is surrendered within the first 14 policy years. We deduct
this charge to compensate us for sales expenses that we would otherwise not
recover in the event of early lapse or surrender. The charge is a
percentage of the premiums we received in the first two policy years that
do not exceed the first year Target Premium, as shown in the following
table:








POLICY YEAR(S)                   PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUMS RECEIVED
     1                                        100%
     2                                         93%
     3                                         86%
     4                                         79%
     5                                         71%
     6                                         64%
     7                                         57%
     8                                         50%
     9                                         43%
     10                                        36%
     11                                        29%
     12                                        21%
     13                                        14%
     14                                         7%
15 and later                                    0%








The percentages may be lower for older issue ages due to certain state law
restrictions. A pro-rata portion of the CDSC may also be charged in the
case of certain types of withdrawals (see "Partial withdrawals" on page XX)


.   Partial withdrawal charge - A $20 charge for each partial withdrawal of
account value to compensate us for the administrative expenses of
processing the withdrawal.


Additional information about how certain policy charges work


Sales expenses and related charges


The sales charges (i.e., the premium sales charge and the CDSC) help to
compensate us for the cost of selling our policies. (See "What charges will we
deduct from your investment in the policy?" in the Basic Information section of
this prospectus.) The amount of the charges in any policy year does not
specifically correspond to sales expenses for that year. We expect to recover
our total sales expenses over the life of the policies. To the extent that the
sales charges do not cover total sales expenses, the sales expenses may be
recovered from other sources, including gains from the asset-based risk charge
and other gains with respect to the policies, or from our general assets.
Similarly, administrative expenses not fully recovered by the issue charge and
the maintenance charge may also be recovered from such other sources.


Effect of premium payment pattern


You may structure the timing of premium payments to minimize the sales
charges, although doing so involves certain risks. Paying less premium in the
first 10 policy years and more in later years could reduce your total sales
charges. For example, if


23





the Target premium was $10,000 and you paid $5,000 in each of the first 10
policy years, you would pay total sales charges of $2,500 and be subject to a
maximum CDSC of $10,000. If you paid $2,500 in each of the first 10 policy years
and $25,000 in policy year 11, you would pay total sales charges of only $1,250
and be subject to a maximum CDSC of only $5,000. However, delaying the payment
of premiums to later policy years could increase the risk that the guaranteed
death benefit feature will not be in effect and the surrender value will be
insufficient to pay policy charges. As a result, the policy or any Additional
Sum Insured may lapse and eventually terminate.


Method of deduction


Unless we agree otherwise, we will deduct the monthly charges described in
the Basic Information section and any CDSC from your policy's investment options
in proportion to the amount of account value you have in each. For each month
that we cannot deduct any charge because of insufficient account value, the
uncollected charges will accumulate and be deducted when and if sufficient
account value becomes available.


The insurance under the policy continues in full force during any grace
period but, if the last surviving insured person dies during the policy grace
period, the amount of unpaid monthly charges is deducted from the death benefit
otherwise payable.


Reduced charges for eligible classes


The charges otherwise applicable may be reduced with respect to policies
issued to a class of associated individuals or to a trustee, employer or similar
entity where we anticipate that the sales to the members of the class will
result in lower than normal sales or administrative expenses, lower taxes or
lower risks to us. We will make these reductions in accordance with our rules in
effect at the time of the application for a policy. The factors we consider in
determining the eligibility of a particular group for reduced charges, and the
level of the reduction, are as follows: the nature of any association and its
organizational framework; the method by which sales will be made to the members
of the class; the facility with which premiums will be collected from any
associated individuals and the association's capabilities with respect to
administrative tasks; the anticipated lapse and surrender rates of the policies;
the size of the class of associated individuals and the number of years it has
been in existence; the aggregate amount of premiums paid; and any other such
circumstances which result in a reduction in sales or administrative expenses,
lower taxes or lower risks. Any reduction in charges will be reasonable and will
apply uniformly to all prospective policy purchasers in the class and will not
unfairly discriminate against any owner.


Other charges could we impose in the future


Except for the tax charge deducted from premium payments, we currently make
no charge for our Federal income taxes. However, if we incur, or expect to
incur, income taxes attributable to any subaccount of the Account or this class
of policies in future years, we reserve the right to make a charge for such
taxes. Any such charge would reduce what you earn on any affected investment
options. However, we expect that no such charge will be necessary.


We also reserve the right to increase the tax charge in order to
correspond, respectively, with changes in the state premium tax levels or in the
Federal income tax treatment of the deferred acquisition costs for this type of
policy.


Under current laws, we may incur state and local taxes (in addition to
premium taxes) in several states. At present, these taxes are not significant.
If there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws, we may make
charges for such taxes.



DESCRIPTION OF CHARGES AT THE FUND LEVEL



The funds must pay investment management fees and other operating expenses.
These fees and expenses (shown in the tables on pages XX and XX) are different
for each fund and reduce the investment return of each fund. Therefore, they
also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any variable investment
options you select. We may also receive payments from a fund or its affiliates
at an annual rate of up to approximately 0.35% of the average net assets that
holders of our variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts
have invested in that fund. Any such payments do not, however, result in any
charge to you in addition to what is shown in the tables.


The figures for the funds shown in the tables on pages XX and XX are based
on historical fund expenses, as a percentage (rounded to two decimal places) of
each fund's average daily net assets for 2002, except as indicated in the
footnotes appearing


24





at the end of those tables. Expenses of the funds are not fixed or specified
under the terms of the policy, and those expenses may vary from year to year.



OTHER POLICY BENEFITS, RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS



Optional benefit riders you can add


When you apply for a policy, you can request any of the optional benefit
riders that we then make available. Availability of any rider, the benefits it
provides and the charges for it may vary by state. Our rules and procedures will
govern eligibility for any rider and, in some cases, the configuration of the
actual rider benefits. Each rider contains specific details that you should
review before you decide to choose the rider. Charges for most riders will be
deducted from the policy's account value. We may change these charges (or the
rates that determine them), but not above any applicable maximum amount stated
in the Policy Specifications page of your policy.


Policy split option rider


At the time of policy issue, you may elect a rider that will permit the
Total Sum Insured to be evenly split into two separate policies, one for each
insured person, but only if the insured persons get divorced or certain Federal
tax law changes occur. The rider may be cancelled at any time, but it will
automatically terminate on the date of death of the first insured person to die
or on the policy anniversary nearest the older insured person's 80th birthday,
whichever is earlier. A policy split could have adverse tax consequences, so
check with your tax adviser before electing this rider.


Optional enhanced cash value rider


If you surrender the policy at any time during the first 4 policy years and
this rider is then in effect, we will pay an Enhanced Cash Value Benefit. The
Benefit is paid in addition to the policy surrender value. The Benefit is equal
to a percentage of first year premiums paid up to the Target Premium. The
percentage will be specified in the policy. Also, if you die during the first 4
policy years and the rider is in effect, we will increase the policy's account
value by the amount of the Benefit in determining the death benefit payable.
Since the rider increases the amount of insurance for which we are at risk, it
increases the amount of the insurance charge described on page XX. The maximum
amount you may borrow from the policy or withdraw from the policy through
partial withdrawals is not effected by this rider. This rider can only be
elected at the time of application for the policy.


Other riders


We currently offer a number of other optional riders, such as the four year
level term rider. Ask your JHVLICO representative for details.


Variations in policy terms


Insurance laws and regulations apply to us in every state in which our
policies are sold. As a result, various terms and conditions of your insurance
coverage may vary from the terms and conditions described in this prospectus,
depending upon where you reside. These variations will be reflected in your
policy or in endorsements attached to your policy.


We may vary the charges and other terms of our policies where special
circumstances result in sales or administrative expenses, mortality risks or
other risks that are different from those normally associated with the policies.
These include the type of variations discussed under "Reduced charges for
eligible classes" on page XX. No variation in any charge will exceed any maximum
stated in this prospectus with respect to that charge.


Any variation discussed above will be made only in accordance with uniform
rules that we adopt and that we apply fairly to our customers.


25





Procedures for issuance of a policy


Generally, the policy is available with a minimum Basic Sum Insured at issue
of $250,000. At the time of issue, each insured person must have an attained age
of at least 20 and no more than 85. All insured persons must meet certain health
and other insurance risk criteria called "underwriting standards".


Policies issued in Montana or in connection with certain employee plans will
not directly reflect the sex of the insured persons in either the premium rates
or the charges or values under the policy.



Minimum Initial Premium



The Minimum Initial Premium must be received by us at our Life Servicing
Office in order for the policy to be in full force and effect. There is no grace
period for the payment of the Minimum Initial Premium. The Minimum Initial
Premium is determined by us based on the characteristics of each of the insured
persons, the Basic Sum Insured and the Additional Sum Insured at issue, and the
policy options you have selected.


Commencement of insurance coverage


After you apply for a policy, it can sometimes take up to several weeks for us
to gather and evaluate all the information we need to decide whether to issue a
policy to you and, if so, what the insured persons' rate classes should be.
After we approve an application for a policy and assign an appropriate insurance
rate class, we will prepare the policy for delivery. We will not pay a death
benefit under a policy unless the policy is in effect when the last surviving
insured person dies (except for the circumstances described under "Temporary
insurance coverage prior to policy delivery" on page XX).


The policy will take effect only if all of the following conditions are
satisfied:


. The policy is delivered to and received by the applicant.


. The Minimum Initial Premium is received by us.


. Each insured person is living and still meets our health criteria for
issuing insurance.


If all of the above conditions are satisfied, the policy will take effect on
the date shown in the policy as the "date of issue." That is the date on which
we begin to deduct monthly charges. Policy months, policy years and policy
anniversaries are all measured from the date of issue.



Backdating



In order to preserve a younger age at issue for at least one of the insured
persons, we can designate a date of issue that is up to 60 days earlier than the
date that would otherwise apply. This is referred to as "backdating" and is
allowed under state insurance laws. Backdating can also be used in certain
corporate-owned life insurance cases involving multiple policies to retain a
common monthly deduction date.


The conditions for coverage described above under "Commencement of insurance
coverage" must still be satisfied, but in a backdating situation the policy
always takes effect retroactively. Backdating results in a lower insurance
charge (if it is used to preserve an insured person's younger age at issue), but
monthly charges begin earlier than would otherwise be the case. Those monthly
charges will be deducted as soon as we receive premiums sufficient to pay them.


Temporary coverage prior to policy delivery


If a specified amount of premium is paid with the application for a policy and
other conditions are met, we will provide temporary survivorship term life
insurance coverage on the insured persons for a period prior to the time
coverage under the policy takes effect. Such temporary survivorship term
coverage will be subject to the terms and conditions described in the
application for the policy, including limits on amount and duration of coverage.


Monthly deduction dates


Each charge that we deduct monthly is assessed against your account value or
the subaccounts at the close of business on the date of issue and at the close
of the first business day in each subsequent policy month.


26





Changes that we can make as to your policy


We reserve the right to make any changes in the policy necessary to ensure the
policy is within the definition of life insurance under the Federal tax laws and
is in compliance with any changes in Federal or state tax laws.


In our policies, we reserve the right to make certain changes if they would
serve the best interests of policy owners or would be appropriate in carrying
out the purposes of the policies. Such changes include the following:


. Changes necessary to comply with or obtain or continue exemptions under
the federal securities laws


. Combining or removing investment options


. Changes in the form of organization of any separate account


Any such changes will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable laws
and only in the manner permitted by such laws. When required by law, we will
obtain your approval of the changes and the approval of any appropriate
regulatory authority.


The owner of the policy


Who owns the policy? That's up to the person who applies for the policy. The
owner of the policy is the person who can exercise most of the rights under the
policy, such as the right to choose the investment options or the right to
surrender the policy. In many cases, the person buying the policy is also the
person who will be the owner. However, the application for a policy can name
another person or entity (such as a trust) as owner. Whenever we've used the
term "you" in this prospectus, we've assumed that the reader is the person who
has whatever right or privilege is being discussed. There may be tax
consequences if the owner and the insured person are different, so you should
discuss this issue with your tax adviser.


While either of the insured persons is alive, you will have a number of
options under the policy. Here are some major ones:


. Determine when and how much you invest in the various investment options


. Borrow or withdraw amounts you have in the investment options


. Change the beneficiary who will receive the death benefit


. Change the amount of insurance


. Turn in (i.e., "surrender") the policy for the full amount of its
surrender value


. Choose the form in which we will pay out the death benefit or other
proceeds


It is possible to name so-called "joint owners" of the policy. If more than
one person owns a policy, all owners must join in most requests to exercise
rights under the policy.


Policy cancellation right


You have the right to cancel your policy within 10 days after you receive it
(the period may be longer in some states). This is often referred to as the
"free look" period. To cancel your policy, simply deliver or mail the policy to:


. JHVLICO at one of the addresses shown on the back cover of this
prospectus, or


.  the JHVLICO representative who delivered the policy to you.


In most states, you will receive a refund of any premiums you've paid. In some
states, the refund will be your account value on the date of cancellation plus
all charges deducted by JHVLICO or the Series Funds prior to that date. The date
of cancellation will be the date of such mailing or delivery.


Reports that you will receive


At least annually, we will send you a statement setting forth the following
information as of the end of the most recent reporting period: the amount of the
death benefit, the Basic Sum Insured and the Additional Sum Insured, the account
value, the portion of the account value in each investment option, the surrender
value, premiums received and charges deducted from


27





premiums since the last report, and any outstanding policy loan (and interest
charged for the preceding policy year). Moreover, you also will receive
confirmations of premium payments, transfers among investment options, policy
loans, partial withdrawals and certain other policy transactions.


Semiannually we will send you a report containing the financial statements of
each Series Fund, including a list of securities held in each fund.


Assigning your policy


You may assign your rights in the policy to someone else as collateral for a
loan or for some other reason. Assignments do not require the consent of any
revocable beneficiary. A copy of the assignment must be forwarded to us. We are
not responsible for any payment we make or any action we take before we receive
notice of the assignment in good order. Nor are we responsible for the validity
of the assignment. An absolute assignment is a change of ownership. All
collateral assignees of record must consent to any full surrender, partial
withdrawal or loan from the policy.


When we pay policy proceeds



General



We will pay any death benefit, withdrawal, surrender value or loan within 7
days after we receive the last required form or request (and, with respect to
the death benefit, any other documentation that may be required). If we don't
have information about the desired manner of payment within 7 days after the
date we receive documentation of the insured person's death, we will pay the
proceeds as a single sum.


Delay to challenge coverage


We may challenge the validity of your insurance policy based on any material
misstatements made to us in the application for the policy. We cannot make such
a challenge, however, beyond certain time limits that are specified in the
policy.


Delay for check clearance


We reserve the right to defer payment of that portion of your account value
that is attributable to a premium payment made by check for a reasonable period
of time (not to exceed 15 days) to allow the check to clear the banking system.


Delay of separate account proceeds


We reserve the right to defer payment of any death benefit, loan or other
distribution that is derived from a variable investment option if (1) the New
York Stock Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday
closings) or trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; (2) an
emergency exists, as a result of which disposal of securities is not reasonably
practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to fairly determine the account
value; or (3) the SEC by order permits the delay for the protection of owners.
Transfers and allocations of account value among the investment options may also
be postponed under these circumstances. If we need to defer calculation of
separate account values for any of the foregoing reasons, all delayed
transactions will be processed at the next values that we do compute.


How you communicate with us



General Rules



You should mail or express all checks and money orders for premium payments
and loan repayments to the JHVLICO Life Servicing Office at the appropriate
address shown on page XX.


Under our current rules, certain requests must be made in writing and be
signed and dated by you. They include the following:


28





.    surrenders or partial withdrawals


.    change of death benefit option


.    increase or decrease in Total Sum Insured


.    change of beneficiary


.    election of payment option for policy proceeds


.    tax withholding elections


.    election of telephone transaction privilege.


The following requests may be made either in writing (signed and dated by
you) or by telephone or fax if a special form is completed (see "Telephone and
Facsimile Transactions" below):


.    loans


.    transfers of account value among investment options


.    change of allocation among investment options for new premium
payments


You should mail or express all written requests to our Life Servicing
Office at the appropriate address shown on page XX. You should also send notice
of the insured person's death and related documentation to our Life Servicing
Office. We don't consider that we've "received" any communication until such
time as it has arrived at the proper place and in the proper and complete form.


We have special forms that should be used for a number of the requests
mentioned above. You can obtain these forms from our Life Servicing Office or
your JHVLICO representative. Each communication to us must include your name,
your policy number and the name of the insured person. We cannot process any
request that doesn't include this required information. Any communication that
arrives after the close of our business day, or on a day that is not a business
day, will be considered "received" by us on the next following business day. Our
business day currently closes at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, but special
circumstances (such as suspension of trading on a major exchange) may dictate an
earlier closing time.



Telephone and Facsimile Transactions



If you complete a special authorization form, you can request loans,
transfers among investment options and changes of allocation among investment
options simply by telephoning us at 1-800-732-5543 or by faxing us at
1-617-886-3048. Any fax request should include your name, daytime telephone
number, policy number and, in the case of transfers and changes of allocation,
the names of the investment options involved. We will honor telephone
instructions from anyone who provides the correct identifying information, so
there is a risk of loss to you if this service is used by an unauthorized
person. However, you will receive written confirmation of all telephone
transactions. There is also a risk that you will be unable to place your request
due to equipment malfunction or heavy phone line usage. If this occurs, you
should submit your request in writing.


Once you have completed a written authorization, you may request a transfer
or policy loan by telephone or by fax. If the fax request option becomes
unavailable, another means of telecommunication will be substituted.


If you authorize telephone transactions, you will be liable for any loss,
expense or cost arising out of any unauthorized or fraudulent telephone
instructions which we reasonably believe to be genuine, unless such loss,
expense or cost is the result of our mistake or negligence. We employ procedures
which provide safeguards against the execution of unauthorized transactions, and
which are reasonably designed to confirm that instructions received by telephone
are genuine. These procedures include requiring personal identification, tape
recording calls, and providing written confirmation to the owner. If we do not
employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions communicated by
telephone are genuine, we may be liable for any loss due to unauthorized or
fraudulent instructions.


The policies are not designed for professional market timing organizations
or other persons or entities that use programmed or frequent transfers among
investment options. For reasons such as that, we reserve the right to change our
telephone and facsimile transaction policies or procedures at any time. We also
reserve the right to suspend or terminate the privilege altogether with respect
to all policies like yours or with respect to any class of such policies.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS



This description of federal income tax consequences is only a brief summary
and is not intended as tax advice. Tax consequences will vary based on your own
particular circumstances, and for further information you should consult a
qualified tax advisor. Federal, state and local tax laws, regulations and
interpretations can change from time to time. As a result, the tax consequences
to you and the beneficiary may be altered, in some cases retroactively.



General



Generally, death benefits paid under policies such as yours are not subject
to income tax. Earnings on your account value are not subject to income tax as
long as we don't pay them out to you. If we do pay out any amount of your
account value upon surrender or partial withdrawal, all or part of that
distribution should generally be treated as a return of the premiums you've paid
and should not be subject to income tax. Amounts you borrow are generally not
taxable to you.


However, some of the tax rules change if your policy is found to be a
"modified endowment contract." This can happen if you've paid more than a
certain amount of premiums that is prescribed by the tax laws. Additional taxes
and penalties may be payable for policy distributions of any kind.


Policy proceeds


We believe the policy will receive the same federal income and estate tax
treatment as fixed benefit life insurance policies. Section 7702 of the Internal
Revenue Code (the "Code") defines a life insurance contract for federal tax
purposes. If certain standards are met at issue and over the life of the policy,
the policy will satisfy that definition. We will monitor compliance with these
standards.


If the policy complies with Section 7702, we believe the death benefit
proceeds under the policy will be excludable from the beneficiary's gross income
under Section 101 of the Code. In addition, if you have elected the Long-Term
Care Acceleration Rider, the rider's benefits generally will be excludable from
gross income under the Code. The tax-free nature of these accelerated benefits
is contingent on the rider meeting specific requirements under Sections 101
and/or Section 7702B of the Code. We have designed the rider to meet these
standards.


Other policy distributions


Increases in account value as a result of interest or investment experience
will not be subject to federal income tax unless and until values are actually
received through distributions. In general, the owner will be taxed on the
amount of distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy. But
under certain circumstances within the first 15 policy years, the owner may be
taxed on a distribution even if total withdrawals do not exceed total premiums
paid. Any taxable distribution will be ordinary income to the owner (rather than
capital gains).


Distributions for tax purposes can include amounts received upon surrender
or partial withdrawals. You may also be deemed to have received a distribution
for tax purposes if you assign all or part of your policy rights or change your
policy's ownership. If you have elected the Long-Term Care Acceleration Rider,
as described beginning on page XX, you may be deemed to have received a
distribution for tax purposes each time a deduction is made from your policy's
account value to pay the rider charge.


We also believe that, except as noted below, loans received under the
policy will be treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan
will constitute income to the owner. However, if the policy terminates for any
reason, the amount of any outstanding loan that was not previously considered
income will be treated as if it had been distributed to the owner upon such
termination. This could result in a considerable tax bill. Under certain
circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans, you might find
yourself having to choose between high premiums requirements to keep your policy
from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur.


It is possible that, despite our monitoring, a policy might fail to qualify
as a life insurance contract under Section 7702 of the Code. This could happen,
for example, if we inadvertently failed to return to you any premium payments
that were in excess of permitted amounts, or if any of the funds failed to meet
certain investment diversification or other requirements of the Code. If this
were to occur, you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to the
policy for the period of the disqualification and for subsequent periods.


30





Tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal,
state and local estate, inheritance, gift and other tax laws depend on the
circumstances of each owner or beneficiary.


Because there may be unfavorable tax consequences (including recognition of
taxable income and the loss of income tax-free treatment for any death benefit
payable to the beneficiary), you should consult a qualified tax adviser prior to
changing the policy's ownership or making any assignment of ownership interests.


Diversification rules and ownership of the Account


Your policy will not qualify for the tax benefit of a life insurance
contract unless the Account follows certain rules requiring diversification of
investments underlying the policy. In addition, the rules require that the
policy owner not have "investment control" over the underlying assets.


The Treasury Department explained in its temporary regulations regarding
diversification that such regulations "do not provide guidance concerning the
circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated asset
account may cause the investor, rather than the insurance company, to be treated
as the owner of the assets in the account". As the variable policy owner, you
will be treated as the owner of Account assets if you have the ability to
exercise investment control over them. If you are found to have such ability,
you will be taxed on any income or gains the assets generate. Although the
Treasury Department announced several years ago that it would provide further
guidance on this issue, it had not yet done so as of the date of this
prospectus.


The ownership rights under your policy are similar to, but different in
certain respects from, those described in Internal Revenue Service rulings in
which it was determined that policyholders were not owners of separate account
assets. Since you have greater flexibility in allocating premiums and policy
values than was the case in those rulings, it is possible that you would be
treated as the owner of your policy's proportionate share of the assets of the
Account.


We do not know what will be in future Treasury Department regulations or
other guidance. We cannot guarantee that the funds will be able to operate as
currently described in the Series Funds' prospectuses, or that a Series Fund
will not have to change any fund's investment objectives or policies. We have
reserved the right to modify your policy if we believe it will prevent you from
being considered the owner of your policy's proportionate share of the assets of
the Account, but we are under no obligation to do so


7-pay premium limit


At the time of policy issuance, we will determine whether the Planned
Premium schedule will exceed the 7-pay limit discussed below. If so, our
standard procedures prohibit issuance of the policy unless you sign a form
acknowledging that fact.


The 7-pay limit is the total of net level premiums that would have been
payable at any time for a comparable fixed policy to be fully "paid-up" after
the payment of 7 equal annual premiums. "Paid-up" means that no further premiums
would be required to continue the coverage in force until maturity, based on
certain prescribed assumptions. If the total premiums paid at any time during
the first 7 policy years exceed the 7-pay limit, the policy will be treated as a
"modified endowment", which can have adverse tax consequences.


The owner will be taxed on distributions and loans from a "modified
endowment" to the extent of any income (gain) to the owner (on an income-first
basis). The distributions and loans affected will be those made on or after, and
within the two year period prior to, the time the policy becomes a modified
endowment. Additionally, a 10% penalty tax may be imposed on taxable portions of
such distributions or loans that are made before the owner attains age 59 1/2.


Furthermore, any time there is a "material change" in a policy (generally
the result of such things as an increase in the Additional Sum Insured, the
addition of certain other policy benefits after issue, a change in death benefit
option, or reinstatement of a lapsed policy), the policy will have a new 7-pay
limit as if it were a newly-issued policy. If a prescribed portion of the
policy's then account value, plus all other premiums paid within 7 years after
the material change, at any time exceed the new 7-pay limit, the policy will
become a modified endowment.


Moreover, if benefits under a policy are reduced (such as a reduction in
the Total Sum Insured or death benefit or the reduction or cancellation of
certain rider benefits) during the 7 years in which a 7-pay test is being
applied, the 7-pay limit will


31





generally be recalculated based on the reduced benefits. If the premiums paid to
date are greater than the recalculated 7-pay limit, the policy will become a
modified endowment.


All modified endowments issued by the same insurer (or its affiliates) to
the owner during any calendar year generally are required to be treated as one
contract for the purpose of applying the modified endowment rules. A policy
received in exchange for a modified endowment will itself also be a modified
endowment. You should consult your tax advisor if you have questions regarding
the possible impact of the 7-pay limit on your policy.



Corporate and H.R. 10 plans



The policy may be acquired in connection with the funding of retirement
plans satisfying the qualification requirements of Section 401 of the Code. If
so, the Code provisions relating to such plans and life insurance benefits
thereunder should be carefully scrutinized. We are not responsible for
compliance with the terms of any such plan or with the requirements of
applicable provisions of the Code.



LEGAL MATTERS



The legal validity of the policies described in this prospectus has been
passed on by Ronald J. Bocage, Vice President and Counsel for JHVLICO. The law
firm of Foley & Lardner, Washington, D.C., has advised us on certain Federal
securities law matters in connection with the policies.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITOR



Under the federal securities laws, the entity responsible for organization of
the registered separate account underlying the variable life insurance policy is
known as the "Depositor." In this case, the Depositor is JHVLICO, a stock life
insurance company chartered in 1979 under Massachusetts law, with its home
office at 197 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02117. JHVLICO is
authorized to transact a life insurance and annuity business in all states other
than New York and in the District of Columbia. JHVLICO began selling variable
life insurance policies in 1980.


JHVLICO is regulated and supervised by the Massachusetts Commissioner of
Insurance, who periodically examines its affairs. JHVLICO is also subject to the
applicable insurance laws and regulations of all jurisdictions in which it is
authorized to do business. JHVLICIO is required to submit annual statements of
its operations, including financial statements, to the insurance departments of
the various jurisdictions in which it does business for purposes of determining
solvency and compliance with local insurance laws and regulations. The
regulation to which JHVLICO is subject, however, does not provide a guarantee as
to such matters.


We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of John Hancock Life Insurance Company ("John
Hancock"), a Massachusetts stock life insurance company. On February 1, 2000,
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (which was chartered in Massachusetts
in 1862) converted to a stock company by "demutualizing" and changed its name to
John Hancock Life Insurance Company. As part of the demutualization process,
John Hancock became a subsidiary of John Hancock Financial Services, Inc., a
newly formed publicly-traded corporation. John Hancock's home office is at John
Hancock Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02117. As of December 31, 2002, John
Hancock's assets were approximately $81 billion and it had invested
approximately $575 million in JHVLICO in connection with JHVLICO's organization
and operation. It is anticipated that John Hancock will from time to time make
additional capital contributions to JHVLICO to enable us to meet our reserve
requirements and expenses in connection with our business. John Hancock is
committed to make additional capital contributions if necessary to ensure that
we maintain a positive net worth.



DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT



Under the federal securities laws, the registered separate account underlying
the variable life insurance policy is known as the "Registrant." In this case,
the Registrant is John Hancock Variable Life Account S (the "Account"), a
separate account established by JHVLICO under Massachusetts law. The variable
investment options shown on page 1 of the prospectus are in fact subaccounts of
the Account. The Account meets the definition of "separate account" under the
Federal securities laws and is registered as a unit investment trust under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act"). Such registration does not involve
supervision by the SEC of the management of the Account or of JHVLICO.


The Account's assets are JHVLICO's property. Each policy provides that amounts
JHVLICO holds in the Account pursuant to the policies cannot be reached by any
other persons who may have claims against JHVLICO.


New subaccounts may be added and made available to policy owners from time to
time. Existing subaccounts may be modified or deleted at any time.



SERVICES PROVIDED BY JOHN HANCOCK AND AFFLIATES



The administration of all policies issued by JHVLICO and of all registered
separate accounts organized by JHVLICO is provided by John Hancock, either
directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries such as John Hancock Signature
Services, Inc. Neither JHVLICO nor the separate accounts are assessed any
charges for such services.



OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS



Until March 1, 2002, John Hancock provided all custodianship and depository
services for the Registrant. As of March 1, 2002, those services were outsourced
to State Street Bank. State Street Bank's address is 225 Franklin Street,
Boston, Massachusetts, 02110.


Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors, have audited the financial statements
of the Registrant at December 31, 2002 and for each of the periods indicated
therein, as set forth in their reports. These financial statements are included
in this Statement of Additional Information in reliance on Ernst & Young LLP's
reports, given on their authority as experts in accounting and auditing. Ernst &
Young LLP's address is 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116.



PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER AND DISTRIBUTOR



Signator Investors, Inc.("Signator"), a subsidiary of John Hancock, acts as
principal distributor of the policies sold through this prospectus. Signator is
registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is
a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Signator's
address is 200 Clarendon Street, John Hancock Place, Boston, Massachusetts
02117.





You can purchase a policy through representatives of broker-dealers and
certain financial institutions who have entered into selling agreements with
Signator and us. We pay compensation to these broker-dealers for promoting,
marketing and selling our products through their representatives who are
authorized by applicable law to sell variable life insurance polices. In turn,
the broker-dealers pay a portion of the compensation to these representatives,
under their own arrangements. The most common schedule of gross commissions
(inclusive of overrides and expense allowance payments paid to such
broker-dealers and financial institutions) is as follows:


. 87.75% of first year premiums paid up to the Target Premium plus 5.85% of
any excess premium payments,


. 5% of all premiums paid up to the Target Premium in policy years 2
through 4 plus 3% of any excess premium payments, and


. 3% of all premium payments paid in policy years 5 through 10.


In situations where the broker dealer provides some or all of the additional
marketing services required, we may pay an additional gross first year
commission of up to 20% of premiums paid up to the Target Premium. In such
instances, we may also pay an additional gross renewal commission. The
additional gross renewal commission would not be expected to exceed 0.10% of
account value less policy loans in policy years 2 and thereafter. For limited
periods of time, we may pay additional compensation to broker-dealers as part of
special sales promotions.


Signator also pays its branch office principals, who are also independent
general agents of ours, for sales of the policies to Signator customers. In
turn, the branch office principals pay a portion of their compensation to their
assigned marketing representatives, under their own arrangements. The most
common schedule of gross commission (inclusive of overrides and expense
allowance payments paid to such branch office principals) is as follows:


. 91.6% of the Target Premium paid in the first policy year, 8% of the
Target Premium paid in each of policy years 2 through 4, and 3% of the
Target Premium paid in each of policy years 5 through 10,


. 7.64% of any premium paid in the first policy year in excess of the
Target Premium,


. 4% of any premium paid in each of policy years 2 through 4 in excess of
the Target Premium and 2% of any premium paid in each of policy years 5
through 10 in excess of the Target Premium,


. 0.35% of account value less policy loans in policy years 2 through 10,
and


. 0.15% of account value less policy loans in policy year 11 and
thereafter.


Representatives who meet certain productivity and persistency standards may be
eligible for additional compensation. From time to time, Signator, at its
expense, may provide significant additional amounts to financial services firms
which sell or arrange for the sale of the policies. Such amounts may include,
for example, financial assistance to financial services firms in connection with
their conferences or seminars, sales or training programs for invited registered
representatives and other employees, payment for travel expenses, including
lodging, incurred by registered representatives and other employees for such
seminars or training programs, seminars for the public, advertising and sales
campaigns regarding the policies, and/or other events or activities sponsored by
the financial services firms.


We offer these contracts on a continuous basis, but Signator is not obligated
to sell any particular amount of policies. Signator also serves as principal
underwriter for John Hancock Variable Annuity Accounts U, I and V, and John
Hancock Variable Life Accounts U, V and UV, all of which are registered under
the 1940 Act. Signator is also the principal underwriter for the John Hancock
Variable Series Trust I.


We reimburse Signator for certain direct and indirect expenses actually
incurred in connection with the marketing of these contracts. John Hancock (on
behalf of JHVLICO) performs insurance underwriting and determines whether to
accept or reject the application for a policy and each insured person's risk
classification. Officers and employees of John Hancock and JHVLICO are covered
by a blanket bond by a commercial carrier in the amount of $25 million.

Item 29. Persons Controlled or Under Common Control with the Depositor or
Registrant



Registrant is a separate account of JHVLICO, operated as a unit investment
trust. Registrant supports benefits payable under JHVLICO's variable life
insurance contracts by investing assets allocated to various investment options
in shares of John Hancock Variable Series Trust I and John Hancock Declaration
Trust, (the "Trusts"), both of which are "series" types of mutual funds
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act") as open-end
management investment companies. The Registrant and other separate accounts of
John Hancock and JHVLICO own controlling interests of the Trusts' outstanding
shares. The purchasers of variable annuity and variable life insurance
contracts, in connection with which the Trusts are used, will have the
opportunity to instruct John Hancock and JHVLICO with respect to the voting of
the shares of the Series Fund held by Registrant as to certain matters. Subject
to the voting instructions, JHVLICO directly controls Registrant


A list of persons controlled by or under common control with the Depositor is
incorporated by reference to Exhibit 21.1 from the Annual Report filed on Form
10-K of File No. 1-15607, filed on March 26, 2002.






Item 30. Indemnification



Pursuant to Section X of JHVLICO's Bylaws and Chapter 156B, Section 67 of the
Massachusetts Business Corporation Law, JHVLICO indemnifies each director,
former director, officer, and former officer, and his heirs and legal
representatives from liability incurred or imposed in connection with any legal
action in which he may be involved by reason of any alleged act or omission as
an officer or a director of JHVLICO.


Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.









Item 31. Principal Underwriters



(a) Signator Investors, Inc. is the principal underwriter for the Fund, John
Hancock Variable Annuity Accounts, I, JF, U, V and H, John Hancock Variable

Why Do You Need Life Insurance?



Life insurance can be one of the most important purchases you will make. You want your family or business to be financially secure, to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and even leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. No matter what your goals are, the unique tax benefits and features of life insurance can help you to achieve them. 


Types of Life Insurance
Choosing the right type of life insurance depends on your circumstances and financial goals. Life insurance policies are designed to pay a death benefit when someone dies, but there are usually two basic categories to meet your different needs - term and permanent. 
Term life insurance in general, provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time.
Permanent life insurance offers lifetime death benefit protection with a cash value component. This can mean lifetime peace of mind for you and your family.
Different types of permanent life insurance are usually categorized as follows: Universal Life Insurance, Indexed Universal Life Insurance, and Variable Universal Life Insurance. To find out what life insurance solution best meets your needs, visit JohnHancockInsurance.com.



















We believe that life insurance should reward you for healthy living. That's why we introduced life insurance with the John Hancock Vitality Program. It's an innovative solution that gives you the protection you need, along with premium savings up to 15% and rewards from national brands for the everyday things you do to stay healthy, like exercising, walking, and eating well.
