The examination of consumer satisfaction in an online context follows the growing consensus that in Internet retailing, as in traditional retailing, consumer satisfaction is not only a critical performance outcome, but also a primary predictor of customer loyalty and thus, the Internet retailer's endurance and success. The current study replicates the initial examination of e-satisfaction within the U.S. by [Szymanski, David M., & Richard T. Hise (2000). E-satisfaction: An initial examination. Journal of Retailing, 76(3), 309–322] among a sample of online consumers drawn from Germany. The replication was extended to two contexts—consumer satisfaction with Internet retail shopping and consumer satisfaction with Internet financial services sites. The results yield rich insights into the validity of extending the measurement and predictors of e-satisfaction to a trans-national context.KeywordsE-satisfactionInternet, e-commerceChoose an option to locate/access this article:Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sign InorPurchaseorCheck for this article elsewhereRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)1Tel.: +1 561 362 6535.2Tel.: +49 251 83 25020.3Tel.: +49 251 83 22808.Copyright © 2004 New York University.

Even though this understanding appears crucial, no studies have examined the factors that make consumers satisfied with their e-retailing experiences. To partly fill this void, the authors examine the role that consumer perceptions of online convenience, merchandising (product offerings and product information), site design, and financial security play in e-satisfaction assessments. They find that convenience, site design, and financial security are the dominant factors in consumer assessments of e-satisfaction. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and offer directions for future research.Choose an option to locate/access this article:Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sign InorPurchaseorCheck for this article elsewhereRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)2Richard T.
