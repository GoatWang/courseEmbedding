The Company also offers remote alarm or monitoring solutions, software and connectivity solutions. The Company provides its products directly and through distributors and OEM partners to hospitals, emergency medical service (EMS) providers, long-term care facilities, physician offices, veterinarians and consumers.The Company's patient monitoring solutions include circuit boards and modules; monitors and devices; patient monitoring and connectivity platform; sensors; line filters and mainstream adapters; remote alarm and monitoring solutions; measurements, and connectivity. The Company's consumer monitoring solutions include devices. The Company's circuit boards include Masimo SET MS Circuit Boards, Masimo rainbow SET MX Circuit Boards and uSpO2 Cable/Board. The Company's Masimo SET MS Circuit Boards perform signal processing and other pulse oximetry functions incorporating the Masimo SET platform. Its boards include MS-2003, MS-2011, MS-2013 and MS-2040. The MX circuit boards offer the functionality of its rainbow technology for non-invasive measurements for total hemoglobin (SpHb), oxygen content (SpOC), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO), methemoglobin (SpMet) and acoustic respiration rate (RRa), in addition to providing Measure-Through-Motion and Low Perfusion oxygen saturation (SpO2), pulse rate (PR) and perfusion index (Pi) measurement capabilities of Masimo SET pulse oximetry. The uSpO2 cable/board provides Masimo SET Measure-Through-Motion and Low Perfusion pulse oximetry found in its other products.The Company's monitors or devices include Radical-7, SatShare, Radius-7, Root, Iris, Pronto, Rad-8, Rad-5, Rad-57, Rad-97, MightySat Rx, SedLine MOC-9 Module, O3 MOC-9 Module, NomoLine Capnography and Gas Monitoring, and uSpO2 Cable/Board. The Radical-7 incorporates its MX circuit board, which enables rainbow SET measurements and offers three-in-one capability that can be used as a standalone device for bedside monitoring; a detachable, battery-operated handheld unit for portable monitoring, and a monitor interface through SatShare. The Radical-7 is a wireless, touch screen device, which is on an upgradeable rainbow SET platform. Radical-7 monitors a patient from the ambulatory environment, to the emergency room, to the operating room, to the general floor and on, until the patient is discharged. Root integrates its rainbow and SET measurements with additional measurements through Masimo Open Connect (MOC-9) in an integrated, clinician-centric platform. Iris connectivity in Root enables third-party devices, such as intravenous pumps and ventilators to connect through Root enabling display, notification and documentation to the electronic medical record through Masimo Patient SafetyNet application.The Company's Radius-7 for the Root is a wearable, wireless monitor with its rainbow SET technology, enabling early identification of clinical deterioration. With rainbow SET non-invasive measurements, Radius-7 with Root can alert clinicians at the bedside or remotely, through Masimo Patient SafetyNet, of critical changes in a patient's oxygen saturation and pulse rate, even during states of motion and low perfusion, as well as respiration through RRa. The Company's SatShare technology enables a conventional monitor to receive continuous measurement updates using Masimo SET through a cable connection from the back of Radical-7 to the sensor input port of the conventional monitor. Pronto is a handheld non-invasive multiparameter testing device that uses Masimo rainbow SET technology to provide oxygen saturation, pulse rate, perfusion index and spot-checking of hemoglobin levels for both hospitals, such as emergency departments, and remote settings, such as physician offices. Rad-8 is a bedside pulse oximeter featuring Masimo SET. Its Rad-5 and Rad-5v are handheld oximeters with Masimo SET.The Company's Rad-57 is a handheld Pulse CO-Oximeter that provides non-invasive measurement of hemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, in addition to oxygen saturation, pulse rate and perfusion index. Its rugged and lightweight design makes it applicable for use in hospital and field settings, specifically for fire departments and emergency medical service units. Rad-97 is a standalone monitor that features Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion pulse oximetry, pulse rate and perfusion index. Additional monitoring solutions, such as the rainbow SET measurements total hemoglobin, methemoglobin, acoustic respiration rate, carboxyhemoglobin and oxygen content, can be added to Rad-97. MightySat Rx is a fingertip pulse oximeter that incorporates Masimo SET Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion technology.The Company offers SedLine monitor that measures brain function on a continuous basis. The SedLine MOC-9 module for Root is an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain function monitor that provides information about a patient's response to anesthesia. O3 MOC-9 Module for Root uses near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to detect regional hypoxemia by continuously measuring tissue oxygen saturation (rSo2), automating the differential analysis of regional to central oxygen saturation. The Company offers a portfolio of capnography and gas monitoring products ranging from external plug-in-and-measure capnography and gas analyzers, integrated modules, and handheld capnograph and capnometer devices. These products offer carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (N2O), oxygen (O2) and anesthetic agent monitoring in hospital environments. Its SET technology-in-a-cable contains the Company's low power (MS-2040) technology in a reduced size, allowing it to be embedded into patient cables as part of the sensor connector.The Company has a range of single-patient use (disposable), reusable, and rainbow sensors and cables.

Multivitamins and other supplements can help make up the difference and prevent vitamin and mineral deficiencies. They can also provide more nutrients than diet alone, which may help to protect against or manage certain diseases. Find out a little bit more about what your body needs to stay healthy. What are the most essential vitamins? The following list of vitamins are essential for the body to function properly: Vitamin A is needed for healthy eyes, skin and skeletal tissue. Vitamin B1 (thiamin) helps the body use up fat and produce energy. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is an antioxidant that protects the body s cells protect against free radical damage. Vitamin B3 (niacin) may reduce the risk of heart disease. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is important for hormone production, immune system health and energy. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) helps protect the layer around cells. Vitamin B7 (biotin) aids the metabolism and promotes healthy skin, hair, nails and cells. Vitamin B9 (folate) is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for the production of healthy red blood and nerve cells. vitamin C is essential for the growth and repair of body tissue. Vitamin D helps with calcium absorption and helps build healthy bones and optimal immune function. Vitamin E protects against free radicals and may also boost the immune system. Vitamin K may help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding while keeping your heart healthy and your bones strong. Choline is important for liver function, nerve function and muscle movement. Optimize your immune system Your immune system serves to protect your body against infection and disease. What you put into our body affects your immune system, and a lack of selected micronutrients can lead to immune deficiency. Vitamins A, C and E help maintain the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts, which acts as a barrier against infection. Vitamin D works with certain white blood cells which are important to the immune system s ability to fight off infection and disease. Selenium acts as an antioxidant to help fight infection and protect the body against oxygen free radical damage. Probiotics help to maintain the integrity of the lining of the intestines, which help to boost immunity. Omega 3 fatty acids are essential for reducing inflammation. Some people have a higher risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. If you've lost weight recently, you may be deficient in a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Be sure to start taking a high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement. These popular supplements come in a wide variety of forms: pills, capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, drinks (liquids and powders) and more. With so many options, it should be easy to find one that works for you. Vegetarians and vegans If you're a vegetarian, you may have deficiencies in protein, vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D, zinc, iodine, riboflavin, calcium and selenium. Vegans are especially likely to be low in protein, selenium and B12. In addition to a multivitamin and mineral supplement, you might want to consider adding a vegan-friendly protein shake or two to your daily regimen. There are a wide variety of shake powders on the market, typically available in, but not limited to, vanilla, chocolate and strawberry flavors. One scoop of protein powder usually provides approximately 25 grams of protein, but it varies from one supplier to another. Macrobiotic diet If you're on a macrobiotic diet, which is fixed on ideas about the types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism, you may be deficient in vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D and other nutrients. The goal as a macrobiotic is to bring enlightenment, or healthy well-being, by teaching you how to thoughtfully choose what you eat. But it may come at a cost of some important vitamins. As with vegetarians and vegans, consider a solid multivitamin as a nutritional supplement. More support for seniors Seniors living in their own homes are often deficient in vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, calcium and zinc and occasionally vitamin B1 and vitamin B2. Older adults need more calcium and vitamin D to help maintain bone health. Try three daily servings of vitamin D-fortified low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt. Other calcium-rich foods include fortified cereals and fruit juices, dark green leafy vegetables and canned fish. These are all great additions to your daily meals, but be sure to take a multivitamin with age-adjusted doses of nutrients for people aged 50 years and older. Workout warriors For those who like to workout with weights, supplements can aid the recovery process and build muscle. Strength training on a regular basis breaks down your muscles so they can grow back bigger and stronger. Be sure to have a solid meal plan, get plenty of rest between workouts, lots of water and consider a protein supplement in the form of powders that can be mixed or protein bars. You can also add creatine to help build muscle and a variety of other workout supplements to assist with your fitness goals. At Walmart, you'll find a wide selection of vitamins and other supplements to help you keep up with your nutritional needs. Save money.

Unfortunately, increasingly busy lifestyles make this a bit difficult at times, so it s important to create a nutritional safety net for yourself by consuming diet and nutritional supplements that can boost your health. The wide variety of diet and nutritional supplements can make it difficult to know what s right for you, so learning the basics of choosing nutritional supplements is the first step to getting the best supplements for your needs   along with talking to your doctor about what you might need to take. With the wide selection of diet and nutritional supplements available at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart, you can easily find all the vitamins and minerals that make it easier to lead a healthy lifestyle. Why should you use supplements? Nothing can replace a diet rich in minerals and vitamins, but when life gets busy and your stress levels rise, you may struggle to find the time to source and prepare nutritious dishes every day. By choosing nutrition supplements, you and your entire family can get the nutrition you need every day, no matter what life throws at you. Alternatively, if you're overweight and would like to lose weight, you may find it helpful to use dieting supplements such as appetite suppressants or fat inhibitors that can control your appetite and help you deal with the constant feeling of hunger. Vitamins and minerals Besides supporting general health, vitamins and mineral supplements may help head off chronic conditions, so it's important to make sure that your risk of dietary deficiencies is low by taking supplements. Before making your choice, ensure that you know what to look for in a multivitamin supplement.  Start by reading the label to identify the nutrients included as well as the amounts per serving.  If you're looking for a daily supplement that's suitable for most individuals, get a combination of basic vitamins and minerals. Some of the essential ingredients in such supplements include vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B6, A, folic acid, Vitamin E, iodine, zinc, magnesium, calcium and iron. Multiple types of multivitamins are targeted at helping individuals with specific conditions or nutritional needs. Women, for example, could take a supplement with folic acid when they're pregnant to help avoid some congenital disabilities. Middle-aged women can take calcium and vitamin D supplements to lower the risk of osteoporosis. Check the percentages to determine whether a certain supplement offers you 100 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for the vitamins and minerals included. You shouldn t take multivitamins that exceed the 100 percent recommended dose. Proteins and meal replacements Protein powders, protein bars and meal replacement supplements are a popular choice for those who engage in sports regularly. The human body needs large amounts of protein as part of a balanced diet, but just like in the case of vitamins and minerals, it may be difficult to get all the amount you need from food. protein shakes are available in multiple types, with the most common of them being protein concentrate, isolate and hydrolysate. Meal replacement shakes are often made with skim milk, and they're high in protein and fiber while being low in fat. They offer a high-energy meal, but they only have around 200 to 300 calories per serving. Protein bars are ideal for those moments you want a nutritious snack on the go. Diet supplements If losing weight is your goal, diet supplements can help you by curbing cravings and suppressing your appetite. Remember that these supplements aren't magic pills for losing weight and that they work well in combination with a nutritious, low-calorie diet and regular exercise. Chromium diet supplements are available in tablet form and they do a good job at reducing excess body fat while helping your body maintain normal sugar levels. Control your diet with an everyday weight loss kit that come complete with everything you need to embrace healthy eating, offering you a variety of breakfast options and snacks. Slimming powders combine appetite suppressants with protein and other nutrients to boost your metabolism. Diet-specific supplements are available at Walmart, so you can find options that are tailored to the specific phases of various diets.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863890, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Masimo is an American Irvine, California-based manufacturer of noninvasive patient monitoring technologies.[2] The company sells more pulse oximetry to hospitals than any other company.[3] Masimo was founded in 1989 by electrical engineer Joe Kiani, who was later joined by fellow engineer Mohamed Diab.[4] Masimo invented measure-through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry, known as Masimo SET (Signal Extraction Technology). Masimo has been recognized for its intellectual property and for being one of the most innovative companies in the medical device industry.[5] The company went public in 2007[6] and is currently traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol MASI. In 2011, Forbes named Masimo to its list of top 20 public companies under a billion dollars in revenue, based on earnings growth, sales growth, and return on equity.[7][8] In 2012, Joe Kiani, founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board was named the Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year - 2012 Life Sciences Award Winner. Kiani was recognized for "revolutionizing the health care industry by taking risks to create and commercialize noninvasive patient monitoring devices, which include an array of sensors that lead to improved accuracy, a reduction in the overall number of false readings, and ultimately, reduced cost of care."[9]

Technology[edit]
Signal Extraction Technology (SET) pulse oximetry[edit]




True and false SpO2 alarm rate of Masimo SET versus 19 competing pulse oximetry technologies.[10]






The Masimo Radical-7 is a pulse oximeter that can also noninvasively measure a patient's hemoglobin and respiration rate.






Masimo SET adhesive sensors monitor oxygenation, pulse rate and "special rainbow" sensors allow additional measurement of noninvasive blood constituents.


Pulse oximetry uses two light emitting diodes (LEDs), one red and one infrared, to measure the absorption of light and translates that into the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound with oxygen, which is called arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). Conventional pulse oximetry assumes that arterial blood is the only blood moving (pulsating) in the measurement site. However, during patient motion, the venous blood also moves, which can cause conventional pulse oximetry to under-read SpO2 levels because it cannot distinguish between the arterial and venous blood.[11][12] SET identifies the venous blood signal (which has a lower oxygen saturation level than arterial blood), isolates it, and uses adaptive filters to cancel the noise and extract the arterial signal in order to report accurate SpO2 and pulse rate. In addition, SET pulse oximetry provides perfusion index (PI) and pleth variability index (PVI). Multiple studies have shown that compared to non-SET pulse oximeters, SET increases the ability to detect life-threatening events and reduces false alarms during challenging conditions.[13][10] Additional studies have also shown the impact of SET on patient outcomes, such as helping clinicians:



Decrease retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in neonates[14][15]
Increase detection of critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in newborns[16]
Reduce ventilator weaning time by titrating FiO2 faster and reduce arterial blood gas measurements in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)[17]
Decrease rapid response activations and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) transfers to save lives and costs in post-surgical patients on the medical-surgical floors through earlier identification of patients in distress through low SpO2 and abnormal pulse rate measurements[18][19]
Decrease fluid administered during surgery and reduce patient risk[20]



In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended mandatory screening for all newborns, using "motion-tolerant pulse oximeters that report functional oxygen saturation have been validated in low perfusion conditions".[21] To make this recommendation, the CCHD workgroup relied on two independent studies that exclusively used SET pulse oximetry to assess newborns. In 2012, Masimo received FDA 510(k) clearance for devices and sensors with labeling for screening newborns for CCHD. It marked the first time the FDA cleared specific labeling indicating the use of pulse oximeters, in conjunction with a physical examination, to screen newborns for CCHD.[22] In 2012, the National Health Service (NHS) Technology Adoption Centre in the United Kingdom advised hospitals to use Intraoperative Fluid Management Technologies as a way to improve patient outcomes, and included Masimo's PVI among technologies available for helping clinicians manage fluid during surgeries.[23] In 2013, the French Society for Anaesthesia and Intensive Care (SFAR) added PVI to its guidelines for optimal hemodynamic management of surgical patients.[24]
rainbow Pulse CO-Oximetry[edit]
rainbow Pulse CO-Oximetry uses more than seven wavelengths of light to continuously and noninvasively measure hemoglobin (SpHb), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO), and methemoglobin (SpMet), in addition to oxygen saturation (SpO2), pulse rate, perfusion index (Pi), and pleth variability index (PVi).[25] A study at Massachusetts General Hospital showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians decrease the frequency of patients receiving blood transfusions during surgery from 4.5% to 0.6%.[26] Another study from Cairo University showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians reduce blood transfusions in high blood loss surgery by an average of 0.9 units per patient.[27] Emergency department studies have shown that SpCO helps clinicians increase the detection of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and decreases the time to treatment compared to invasive methods.[28][29][30] The Pronto-7 device for noninvasive spot checking of hemoglobin, along with SpO2 and pulse rate, has been recognized with a gold Medical Design Excellence Award.[31] The World Health Organization called noninvasive hemoglobin an "innovative medical technology for cost-effectively addressing global health concerns and needs".[32]
In October 2014, Masimo announced CE Mark of Oxygen Reserve Index or ORi, the company’s 11th noninvasive parameter, which provides real-time visibility to oxygenation status. ORi is intended to supplement, not replace, oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) measurements. ORi can be trended and has optional alarms to notify clinicians of changes in a patient’s oxygen reserve, and may enable proactive interventions to avoid hypoxia and unintended hyperoxia.
Noninvasive Patient Monitoring[edit]
Patient SafetyNet[edit]
Patient SafetyNet is a remote monitoring and notification system designed for patients on medical/surgical care floors.[33] A large study by Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center showed Patient SafetyNet helped clinicians achieve a 65% reduction in distress codes and rescue activations and a 48% decrease in patient transfers to intensive care units (ICU), yielding a savings of 135 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) days annually for an annual opportunity-cost savings of $1.48 million.[34][35] ECRI Institute gave Dartmouth its Health Devices Achievement Award for its use of Patient SafetyNet to prevent "severe patient harm".[36] Masimo has introduced Halo Index in the Patient SafetyNet system, combining multiple physiologic parameters into one number to help clinicians assess overall patient status.[37]
Rainbow acoustic monitoring[edit]
Rainbow acoustic monitoring provides noninvasive and continuous measurement of respiration rate using an adhesive sensor with an integrated acoustic transducer that is applied to the patient's neck.[38][39] Researchers have evaluated acoustic respiration rate (RRa) and found the acceptable accuracy and significantly fewer false alarms than traditional respiration rate monitoring methods, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and impedance pneumography.[40]
SedLine brain function monitoring[edit]
In 2010, Masimo began offering brain function monitoring to measure the effects of anesthesia and sedation by monitoring both sides of the brain's electrical activity (EEG). Studies have shown this results in more individualized titration and improved care.[41]
Capnography and gas monitoring[edit]
In 2012, Masimo began offering ultra-compact mainstream and sidestream capnography as well as multigas analyzers for end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), oxygen (O2), and anesthetic agents, for use in the operating room, procedural sedation, and in intensive care units (ICU).[42] A multi-center study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University Medical Center (Tucson, Arizona), and Children's Medical Center (Dallas), found that respiratory rate measured from noninvasive, acoustic monitoring had similar accuracy and precision as nasal capnography, the current standard of care when used in pediatric patients.[43]
Radius-7[edit]
On December 1, 2014, Masimo announced FDA 510(k) clearance of Radius-7 for the Root patient monitoring and connectivity platform, the first and only wearable, wireless monitor with Masimo’s rainbow SET technology, enabling early identification of clinical deterioration while offering patients continuous monitoring with freedom of movement. Radius-7 attaches to the patient’s arm or can be placed alongside the patient in their bed, allowing untethered monitoring. Studies have shown that patient mobility is a key factor in more rapid patient recovery.[44]
iSpO2 pulse oximeter for smart phones and tablets[edit]
iSpO2 pulse oximeter was awarded the Hot Product Award at the 2013 EMS Today Conference & Exposition.[45]
Supported Causes[edit]
Clinton Global Initiative[edit]
In 2012, Masimo embarked on its first Commitment to Action with the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) to solve the global problem of maternal mortality and anemia. The $1 million, two-year project initially focuses on five villages in Liberia and Uganda – two countries where the epidemics of maternal mortality and anemia are among the worst.[46]
Patient Safety Movement Foundation[edit]
In 2013, Masimo founder, Chairman and CEO Joe Kiani, created the nonprofit Patient Safety Movement Foundation with a mission to eliminate the more than 200,000[47] preventable patient deaths that occur in U.S. hospitals each year. The foundation holds annual Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summits, featuring leaders from healthcare, industry, and government; former President Bill Clinton has served as the keynote speaker.

Masimo is an American Irvine, California-based manufacturer of noninvasive patient monitoring technologies.[2] The company sells more pulse oximetry to hospitals than any other company.[3] Masimo was founded in 1989 by electrical engineer Joe Kiani, who was later joined by fellow engineer Mohamed Diab.[4] Masimo invented measure-through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry, known as Masimo SET (Signal Extraction Technology). Masimo has been recognized for its intellectual property and for being one of the most innovative companies in the medical device industry.[5] The company went public in 2007[6] and is currently traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol MASI. In 2011, Forbes named Masimo to its list of top 20 public companies under a billion dollars in revenue, based on earnings growth, sales growth, and return on equity.[7][8] In 2012, Joe Kiani, founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board was named the Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year - 2012 Life Sciences Award Winner. Kiani was recognized for "revolutionizing the health care industry by taking risks to create and commercialize noninvasive patient monitoring devices, which include an array of sensors that lead to improved accuracy, a reduction in the overall number of false readings, and ultimately, reduced cost of care."[9]

Technology[edit]
Signal Extraction Technology (SET) pulse oximetry[edit]




True and false SpO2 alarm rate of Masimo SET versus 19 competing pulse oximetry technologies.[10]






The Masimo Radical-7 is a pulse oximeter that can also noninvasively measure a patient's hemoglobin and respiration rate.






Masimo SET adhesive sensors monitor oxygenation, pulse rate and "special rainbow" sensors allow additional measurement of noninvasive blood constituents.


Pulse oximetry uses two light emitting diodes (LEDs), one red and one infrared, to measure the absorption of light and translates that into the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound with oxygen, which is called arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). Conventional pulse oximetry assumes that arterial blood is the only blood moving (pulsating) in the measurement site. However, during patient motion, the venous blood also moves, which can cause conventional pulse oximetry to under-read SpO2 levels because it cannot distinguish between the arterial and venous blood.[11][12] SET identifies the venous blood signal (which has a lower oxygen saturation level than arterial blood), isolates it, and uses adaptive filters to cancel the noise and extract the arterial signal in order to report accurate SpO2 and pulse rate. In addition, SET pulse oximetry provides perfusion index (PI) and pleth variability index (PVI). Multiple studies have shown that compared to non-SET pulse oximeters, SET increases the ability to detect life-threatening events and reduces false alarms during challenging conditions.[13][10] Additional studies have also shown the impact of SET on patient outcomes, such as helping clinicians:



Decrease retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in neonates[14][15]
Increase detection of critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in newborns[16]
Reduce ventilator weaning time by titrating FiO2 faster and reduce arterial blood gas measurements in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)[17]
Decrease rapid response activations and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) transfers to save lives and costs in post-surgical patients on the medical-surgical floors through earlier identification of patients in distress through low SpO2 and abnormal pulse rate measurements[18][19]
Decrease fluid administered during surgery and reduce patient risk[20]



In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended mandatory screening for all newborns, using "motion-tolerant pulse oximeters that report functional oxygen saturation have been validated in low perfusion conditions".[21] To make this recommendation, the CCHD workgroup relied on two independent studies that exclusively used SET pulse oximetry to assess newborns. In 2012, Masimo received FDA 510(k) clearance for devices and sensors with labeling for screening newborns for CCHD. It marked the first time the FDA cleared specific labeling indicating the use of pulse oximeters, in conjunction with a physical examination, to screen newborns for CCHD.[22] In 2012, the National Health Service (NHS) Technology Adoption Centre in the United Kingdom advised hospitals to use Intraoperative Fluid Management Technologies as a way to improve patient outcomes, and included Masimo's PVI among technologies available for helping clinicians manage fluid during surgeries.[23] In 2013, the French Society for Anaesthesia and Intensive Care (SFAR) added PVI to its guidelines for optimal hemodynamic management of surgical patients.[24]
rainbow Pulse CO-Oximetry[edit]
rainbow Pulse CO-Oximetry uses more than seven wavelengths of light to continuously and noninvasively measure hemoglobin (SpHb), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO), and methemoglobin (SpMet), in addition to oxygen saturation (SpO2), pulse rate, perfusion index (Pi), and pleth variability index (PVi).[25] A study at Massachusetts General Hospital showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians decrease the frequency of patients receiving blood transfusions during surgery from 4.5% to 0.6%.[26] Another study from Cairo University showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians reduce blood transfusions in high blood loss surgery by an average of 0.9 units per patient.[27] Emergency department studies have shown that SpCO helps clinicians increase the detection of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and decreases the time to treatment compared to invasive methods.[28][29][30] The Pronto-7 device for noninvasive spot checking of hemoglobin, along with SpO2 and pulse rate, has been recognized with a gold Medical Design Excellence Award.[31] The World Health Organization called noninvasive hemoglobin an "innovative medical technology for cost-effectively addressing global health concerns and needs".[32]
In October 2014, Masimo announced CE Mark of Oxygen Reserve Index or ORi, the company’s 11th noninvasive parameter, which provides real-time visibility to oxygenation status. ORi is intended to supplement, not replace, oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) measurements. ORi can be trended and has optional alarms to notify clinicians of changes in a patient’s oxygen reserve, and may enable proactive interventions to avoid hypoxia and unintended hyperoxia.
Noninvasive Patient Monitoring[edit]
Patient SafetyNet[edit]
Patient SafetyNet is a remote monitoring and notification system designed for patients on medical/surgical care floors.[33] A large study by Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center showed Patient SafetyNet helped clinicians achieve a 65% reduction in distress codes and rescue activations and a 48% decrease in patient transfers to intensive care units (ICU), yielding a savings of 135 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) days annually for an annual opportunity-cost savings of $1.48 million.[34][35] ECRI Institute gave Dartmouth its Health Devices Achievement Award for its use of Patient SafetyNet to prevent "severe patient harm".[36] Masimo has introduced Halo Index in the Patient SafetyNet system, combining multiple physiologic parameters into one number to help clinicians assess overall patient status.[37]
Rainbow acoustic monitoring[edit]
Rainbow acoustic monitoring provides noninvasive and continuous measurement of respiration rate using an adhesive sensor with an integrated acoustic transducer that is applied to the patient's neck.[38][39] Researchers have evaluated acoustic respiration rate (RRa) and found the acceptable accuracy and significantly fewer false alarms than traditional respiration rate monitoring methods, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and impedance pneumography.[40]
SedLine brain function monitoring[edit]
In 2010, Masimo began offering brain function monitoring to measure the effects of anesthesia and sedation by monitoring both sides of the brain's electrical activity (EEG). Studies have shown this results in more individualized titration and improved care.[41]
Capnography and gas monitoring[edit]
In 2012, Masimo began offering ultra-compact mainstream and sidestream capnography as well as multigas analyzers for end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), oxygen (O2), and anesthetic agents, for use in the operating room, procedural sedation, and in intensive care units (ICU).[42] A multi-center study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University Medical Center (Tucson, Arizona), and Children's Medical Center (Dallas), found that respiratory rate measured from noninvasive, acoustic monitoring had similar accuracy and precision as nasal capnography, the current standard of care when used in pediatric patients.[43]
Radius-7[edit]
On December 1, 2014, Masimo announced FDA 510(k) clearance of Radius-7 for the Root patient monitoring and connectivity platform, the first and only wearable, wireless monitor with Masimo’s rainbow SET technology, enabling early identification of clinical deterioration while offering patients continuous monitoring with freedom of movement. Radius-7 attaches to the patient’s arm or can be placed alongside the patient in their bed, allowing untethered monitoring. Studies have shown that patient mobility is a key factor in more rapid patient recovery.[44]

Clinton Global Initiative[edit]
In 2012, Masimo embarked on its first Commitment to Action with the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) to solve the global problem of maternal mortality and anemia. The $1 million, two-year project initially focuses on five villages in Liberia and Uganda – two countries where the epidemics of maternal mortality and anemia are among the worst.[46]
Patient Safety Movement Foundation[edit]
In 2013, Masimo founder, Chairman and CEO Joe Kiani, created the nonprofit Patient Safety Movement Foundation with a mission to eliminate the more than 200,000[47] preventable patient deaths that occur in U.S. hospitals each year. The foundation holds annual Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summits, featuring leaders from healthcare, industry, and government; former President Bill Clinton has served as the keynote speaker.

Masimo is an American Irvine, California-based manufacturer of noninvasive patient monitoring technologies.[2] The company sells more pulse oximetry to hospitals than any other company.[3] Masimo was founded in 1989 by electrical engineer Joe Kiani, who was later joined by fellow engineer Mohamed Diab.[4] Masimo invented measure-through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry, known as Masimo SET (Signal Extraction Technology). Masimo has been recognized for its intellectual property and for being one of the most innovative companies in the medical device industry.[5] The company went public in 2007[6] and is currently traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol MASI. In 2011, Forbes named Masimo to its list of top 20 public companies under a billion dollars in revenue, based on earnings growth, sales growth, and return on equity.[7][8] In 2012, Joe Kiani, founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board was named the Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year - 2012 Life Sciences Award Winner. Kiani was recognized for "revolutionizing the health care industry by taking risks to create and commercialize noninvasive patient monitoring devices, which include an array of sensors that lead to improved accuracy, a reduction in the overall number of false readings, and ultimately, reduced cost of care."[9]

Technology[edit]
Signal Extraction Technology (SET) pulse oximetry[edit]




True and false SpO2 alarm rate of Masimo SET versus 19 competing pulse oximetry technologies.[10]






The Masimo Radical-7 is a pulse oximeter that can also noninvasively measure a patient's hemoglobin and respiration rate.






Masimo SET adhesive sensors monitor oxygenation, pulse rate and "special rainbow" sensors allow additional measurement of noninvasive blood constituents.


Pulse oximetry uses two light emitting diodes (LEDs), one red and one infrared, to measure the absorption of light and translates that into the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound with oxygen, which is called arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). Conventional pulse oximetry assumes that arterial blood is the only blood moving (pulsating) in the measurement site. However, during patient motion, the venous blood also moves, which can cause conventional pulse oximetry to under-read SpO2 levels because it cannot distinguish between the arterial and venous blood.[11][12] SET identifies the venous blood signal (which has a lower oxygen saturation level than arterial blood), isolates it, and uses adaptive filters to cancel the noise and extract the arterial signal in order to report accurate SpO2 and pulse rate. In addition, SET pulse oximetry provides perfusion index (PI) and pleth variability index (PVI). Multiple studies have shown that compared to non-SET pulse oximeters, SET increases the ability to detect life-threatening events and reduces false alarms during challenging conditions.[13][10] Additional studies have also shown the impact of SET on patient outcomes, such as helping clinicians:



Decrease retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in neonates[14][15]
Increase detection of critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in newborns[16]
Reduce ventilator weaning time by titrating FiO2 faster and reduce arterial blood gas measurements in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)[17]
Decrease rapid response activations and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) transfers to save lives and costs in post-surgical patients on the medical-surgical floors through earlier identification of patients in distress through low SpO2 and abnormal pulse rate measurements[18][19]
Decrease fluid administered during surgery and reduce patient risk[20]



In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended mandatory screening for all newborns, using "motion-tolerant pulse oximeters that report functional oxygen saturation have been validated in low perfusion conditions".[21] To make this recommendation, the CCHD workgroup relied on two independent studies that exclusively used SET pulse oximetry to assess newborns. In 2012, Masimo received FDA 510(k) clearance for devices and sensors with labeling for screening newborns for CCHD. It marked the first time the FDA cleared specific labeling indicating the use of pulse oximeters, in conjunction with a physical examination, to screen newborns for CCHD.[22] In 2012, the National Health Service (NHS) Technology Adoption Centre in the United Kingdom advised hospitals to use Intraoperative Fluid Management Technologies as a way to improve patient outcomes, and included Masimo's PVI among technologies available for helping clinicians manage fluid during surgeries.[23] In 2013, the French Society for Anaesthesia and Intensive Care (SFAR) added PVI to its guidelines for optimal hemodynamic management of surgical patients.[24]
rainbow Pulse CO-Oximetry[edit]
rainbow Pulse CO-Oximetry uses more than seven wavelengths of light to continuously and noninvasively measure hemoglobin (SpHb), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO), and methemoglobin (SpMet), in addition to oxygen saturation (SpO2), pulse rate, perfusion index (Pi), and pleth variability index (PVi).[25] A study at Massachusetts General Hospital showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians decrease the frequency of patients receiving blood transfusions during surgery from 4.5% to 0.6%.[26] Another study from Cairo University showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians reduce blood transfusions in high blood loss surgery by an average of 0.9 units per patient.[27] Emergency department studies have shown that SpCO helps clinicians increase the detection of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and decreases the time to treatment compared to invasive methods.[28][29][30] The Pronto-7 device for noninvasive spot checking of hemoglobin, along with SpO2 and pulse rate, has been recognized with a gold Medical Design Excellence Award.[31] The World Health Organization called noninvasive hemoglobin an "innovative medical technology for cost-effectively addressing global health concerns and needs".[32]
In October 2014, Masimo announced CE Mark of Oxygen Reserve Index or ORi, the company’s 11th noninvasive parameter, which provides real-time visibility to oxygenation status. ORi is intended to supplement, not replace, oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) measurements. ORi can be trended and has optional alarms to notify clinicians of changes in a patient’s oxygen reserve, and may enable proactive interventions to avoid hypoxia and unintended hyperoxia.
Noninvasive Patient Monitoring[edit]
Patient SafetyNet[edit]
Patient SafetyNet is a remote monitoring and notification system designed for patients on medical/surgical care floors.[33] A large study by Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center showed Patient SafetyNet helped clinicians achieve a 65% reduction in distress codes and rescue activations and a 48% decrease in patient transfers to intensive care units (ICU), yielding a savings of 135 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) days annually for an annual opportunity-cost savings of $1.48 million.[34][35] ECRI Institute gave Dartmouth its Health Devices Achievement Award for its use of Patient SafetyNet to prevent "severe patient harm".[36] Masimo has introduced Halo Index in the Patient SafetyNet system, combining multiple physiologic parameters into one number to help clinicians assess overall patient status.[37]
Rainbow acoustic monitoring[edit]
Rainbow acoustic monitoring provides noninvasive and continuous measurement of respiration rate using an adhesive sensor with an integrated acoustic transducer that is applied to the patient's neck.[38][39] Researchers have evaluated acoustic respiration rate (RRa) and found the acceptable accuracy and significantly fewer false alarms than traditional respiration rate monitoring methods, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and impedance pneumography.[40]
SedLine brain function monitoring[edit]
In 2010, Masimo began offering brain function monitoring to measure the effects of anesthesia and sedation by monitoring both sides of the brain's electrical activity (EEG). Studies have shown this results in more individualized titration and improved care.[41]
Capnography and gas monitoring[edit]
In 2012, Masimo began offering ultra-compact mainstream and sidestream capnography as well as multigas analyzers for end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), oxygen (O2), and anesthetic agents, for use in the operating room, procedural sedation, and in intensive care units (ICU).[42] A multi-center study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University Medical Center (Tucson, Arizona), and Children's Medical Center (Dallas), found that respiratory rate measured from noninvasive, acoustic monitoring had similar accuracy and precision as nasal capnography, the current standard of care when used in pediatric patients.[43]
Radius-7[edit]
On December 1, 2014, Masimo announced FDA 510(k) clearance of Radius-7 for the Root patient monitoring and connectivity platform, the first and only wearable, wireless monitor with Masimo’s rainbow SET technology, enabling early identification of clinical deterioration while offering patients continuous monitoring with freedom of movement. Radius-7 attaches to the patient’s arm or can be placed alongside the patient in their bed, allowing untethered monitoring. Studies have shown that patient mobility is a key factor in more rapid patient recovery.[44]
iSpO2 pulse oximeter for smart phones and tablets[edit]
iSpO2 pulse oximeter was awarded the Hot Product Award at the 2013 EMS Today Conference & Exposition.[45]
Supported Causes[edit]
Clinton Global Initiative[edit]
In 2012, Masimo embarked on its first Commitment to Action with the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) to solve the global problem of maternal mortality and anemia. The $1 million, two-year project initially focuses on five villages in Liberia and Uganda – two countries where the epidemics of maternal mortality and anemia are among the worst.[46]
Patient Safety Movement Foundation[edit]
In 2013, Masimo founder, Chairman and CEO Joe Kiani, created the nonprofit Patient Safety Movement Foundation with a mission to eliminate the more than 200,000[47] preventable patient deaths that occur in U.S. hospitals each year. The foundation holds annual Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summits, featuring leaders from healthcare, industry, and government; former President Bill Clinton has served as the keynote speaker.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
