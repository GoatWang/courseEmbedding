Mary Flora Bell (born 26 May 1957) is an English woman who, in 1968, aged 10–11, strangled to death two younger boys in Scotswood, an inner-city suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne. She was convicted in December 1968 of the manslaughter of Martin Brown (aged 4) and Brian Howe (aged 3).[1]
Since her release from prison in 1980, she has lived under a series of pseudonyms. Her identity has been protected by a court order, which has also been extended to protect the identity of her daughter. In 1998, Bell collaborated with Gitta Sereny on an account of her life, in which she details the abuse she suffered as a child at the hands of her mother – a prostitute – and her mother's clients.

Early life[edit]
Bell's mother Betty (née McCrickett) was a prostitute, who was often absent from the family home, travelling to Glasgow to work. Mary (nicknamed May)[1] was her first child, born when Betty was 16 years old. It is not known who Mary's biological father was. For most of her life she believed it to be Billy Bell, a habitual criminal who was later arrested for armed robbery. Bell married her mother when Mary was a baby, but evidence gathered by Gitta Sereny suggests he met her after Mary was born.[2]
Independent accounts from family members strongly suggest that Betty had more than once attempted to kill Mary and make her death look accidental during the first few years of her life. Her family was suspicious when Mary "fell" from a window, and when she "accidentally" consumed sleeping pills. On one such occasion, an independent witness saw Betty giving the pills to her daughter as sweets.[2] Mary herself says she was subjected to repeated sexual abuse, her mother forcing her from the age of four to engage in sexual acts with men.[3]
Killings[edit]
On 25 May 1968, the day before her 11th birthday, Mary Bell strangled 4-year-old Martin Brown in a derelict house.[1] She was believed to have committed this crime alone. Between that time and a second killing, she and a friend, Norma Joyce Bell (1955–89; no relation), aged 13, broke into and vandalised a nursery in Scotswood, leaving notes that claimed responsibility for the killing. The police dismissed this incident as a prank.[4]
On 31 July 1968, the two girls took part in the death, again by strangulation, of 3-year-old Brian Howe, in a wasteland in the same Scotswood area.[1] Police reports concluded that Mary Bell had later returned to his body to carve an "M" into the boy's stomach. Mary Bell also used a pair of scissors to cut off some of Howe's hair, scratch his legs, and mutilate his penis.[5]
An open verdict had originally been recorded for Brown's death as there was no evidence of foul play – although Bell had strangled him, her grip was not hard enough to leave any marks.[6] Eventually, his death was linked with Howe's killing and in August 1968 the two girls were charged with two counts of manslaughter.
Conviction and imprisonment[edit]
On 17 December 1968, at Newcastle Assizes, Norma Bell was acquitted but Mary Bell was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, the jury taking their lead from her diagnosis by court-appointed psychiatrists who described her as displaying "classic symptoms of psychopathy". The judge, Justice Cusack, described her as dangerous and said she posed a "very grave risk to other children". She was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, effectively an indefinite sentence of imprisonment. She was initially sent to Red Bank secure unit in St. Helens, Lancashire – the same facility that would house Jon Venables, one of James Bulger's killers, 25 years later.[1]
After her conviction, Bell was the focus of a great deal of attention from the British press and also from the German magazine Stern. Her mother repeatedly sold stories about her to the press and often gave reporters writings she claimed to be by her daughter. Bell herself made headlines when, in September 1977, she briefly absconded from Moor Court open prison, where she had been held since her transfer from a young offenders institution to an adult prison a year earlier. Her penalty for this was a loss of prison privileges for 28 days.[7]
For a time, Bell also lived in a girls' remand home at Cumberlow Lodge in South Norwood (in a house built by Victorian inventor William Stanley).[8][9]
Life after prison[edit]
In 1980, Bell, aged 23, was released from Askham Grange open prison after having served 12 years and was granted anonymity (including a new name), allowing her to start a new life. Four years later she had a daughter, born on 25 May 1984. Bell's daughter did not know of her mother's past until Bell's location was discovered by reporters in 1998 and she and her mother had to leave their house with bed sheets over their heads.
Bell's daughter's anonymity was originally protected only until she reached the age of 18. However, on 21 May 2003, Bell won a High Court battle to have her own anonymity and that of her daughter extended for life. Any court order permanently protecting the identity of a convict in Britain is consequently sometimes known as a "Mary Bell order".
In 2009, it was reported that Bell had become a grandmother.[10]
Books about the case[edit]
Bell is the subject of two books by Gitta Sereny: The Case of Mary Bell (1972), an account of the killings and trial, and Cries Unheard: the Story of Mary Bell (1998), an in-depth biography based on interviews with Bell and relatives, friends and professionals who knew her during and after her imprisonment.[11] This second book was the first to detail Bell's account of sexual abuse at the hands of her mother, a prostitute who specialised as a dominatrix, and her mother's clients.
The publication of Cries Unheard was controversial because Bell received payment for her participation. The payment was criticised by the tabloid press, and Tony Blair's government attempted to find a legal means to prevent its publication on the grounds that a criminal should not profit from his or her crimes, but the attempt was unsuccessful.

On 31 July 1968, the two girls took part in the death, again by strangulation, of 3-year-old Brian Howe, in a wasteland in the same Scotswood area.[1] Police reports concluded that Mary Bell had later returned to his body to carve an "M" into the boy's stomach. Mary Bell also used a pair of scissors to cut off some of Howe's hair, scratch his legs, and mutilate his penis.[5]
An open verdict had originally been recorded for Brown's death as there was no evidence of foul play – although Bell had strangled him, her grip was not hard enough to leave any marks.[6] Eventually, his death was linked with Howe's killing and in August 1968 the two girls were charged with two counts of manslaughter.
Conviction and imprisonment[edit]
On 17 December 1968, at Newcastle Assizes, Norma Bell was acquitted but Mary Bell was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, the jury taking their lead from her diagnosis by court-appointed psychiatrists who described her as displaying "classic symptoms of psychopathy". The judge, Justice Cusack, described her as dangerous and said she posed a "very grave risk to other children". She was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, effectively an indefinite sentence of imprisonment. She was initially sent to Red Bank secure unit in St. Helens, Lancashire – the same facility that would house Jon Venables, one of James Bulger's killers, 25 years later.[1]
After her conviction, Bell was the focus of a great deal of attention from the British press and also from the German magazine Stern. Her mother repeatedly sold stories about her to the press and often gave reporters writings she claimed to be by her daughter. Bell herself made headlines when, in September 1977, she briefly absconded from Moor Court open prison, where she had been held since her transfer from a young offenders institution to an adult prison a year earlier. Her penalty for this was a loss of prison privileges for 28 days.[7]
For a time, Bell also lived in a girls' remand home at Cumberlow Lodge in South Norwood (in a house built by Victorian inventor William Stanley).[8][9]
Life after prison[edit]
In 1980, Bell, aged 23, was released from Askham Grange open prison after having served 12 years and was granted anonymity (including a new name), allowing her to start a new life. Four years later she had a daughter, born on 25 May 1984. Bell's daughter did not know of her mother's past until Bell's location was discovered by reporters in 1998 and she and her mother had to leave their house with bed sheets over their heads.
Bell's daughter's anonymity was originally protected only until she reached the age of 18. However, on 21 May 2003, Bell won a High Court battle to have her own anonymity and that of her daughter extended for life. Any court order permanently protecting the identity of a convict in Britain is consequently sometimes known as a "Mary Bell order".
In 2009, it was reported that Bell had become a grandmother.[10]
Books about the case[edit]
Bell is the subject of two books by Gitta Sereny: The Case of Mary Bell (1972), an account of the killings and trial, and Cries Unheard: the Story of Mary Bell (1998), an in-depth biography based on interviews with Bell and relatives, friends and professionals who knew her during and after her imprisonment.[11] This second book was the first to detail Bell's account of sexual abuse at the hands of her mother, a prostitute who specialised as a dominatrix, and her mother's clients.
The publication of Cries Unheard was controversial because Bell received payment for her participation. The payment was criticised by the tabloid press, and Tony Blair's government attempted to find a legal means to prevent its publication on the grounds that a criminal should not profit from his or her crimes, but the attempt was unsuccessful.

Mary Flora Bell (born 26 May 1957) is an English woman who, in 1968, aged 10–11, strangled to death two younger boys in Scotswood, an inner-city suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne. She was convicted in December 1968 of the manslaughter of Martin Brown (aged 4) and Brian Howe (aged 3).[1]
Since her release from prison in 1980, she has lived under a series of pseudonyms. Her identity has been protected by a court order, which has also been extended to protect the identity of her daughter. In 1998, Bell collaborated with Gitta Sereny on an account of her life, in which she details the abuse she suffered as a child at the hands of her mother – a prostitute – and her mother's clients.

Early life[edit]
Bell's mother Betty (née McCrickett) was a prostitute, who was often absent from the family home, travelling to Glasgow to work. Mary (nicknamed May)[1] was her first child, born when Betty was 16 years old. It is not known who Mary's biological father was. For most of her life she believed it to be Billy Bell, a habitual criminal who was later arrested for armed robbery. Bell married her mother when Mary was a baby, but evidence gathered by Gitta Sereny suggests he met her after Mary was born.[2]
Independent accounts from family members strongly suggest that Betty had more than once attempted to kill Mary and make her death look accidental during the first few years of her life. Her family was suspicious when Mary "fell" from a window, and when she "accidentally" consumed sleeping pills. On one such occasion, an independent witness saw Betty giving the pills to her daughter as sweets.[2] Mary herself says she was subjected to repeated sexual abuse, her mother forcing her from the age of four to engage in sexual acts with men.[3]
Killings[edit]
On 25 May 1968, the day before her 11th birthday, Mary Bell strangled 4-year-old Martin Brown in a derelict house.[1] She was believed to have committed this crime alone. Between that time and a second killing, she and a friend, Norma Joyce Bell (1955–89; no relation), aged 13, broke into and vandalised a nursery in Scotswood, leaving notes that claimed responsibility for the killing. The police dismissed this incident as a prank.[4]
On 31 July 1968, the two girls took part in the death, again by strangulation, of 3-year-old Brian Howe, in a wasteland in the same Scotswood area.[1] Police reports concluded that Mary Bell had later returned to his body to carve an "M" into the boy's stomach.

Child killer Mary Bell becomes a grandmother at 51: But all I have left is grief, says victim's mother

Child killer Mary Bell has become a grandmother, it emerged yesterday. Bell became notorious at 11 after being convicted of strangling two small boys 'solely for the pleasure and excitement' of killing. Now 51, the woman at the centre of one of the most sensational trials of the 20th century later won a court order giving her the right to anonymity for life. The ruling is similar to those protecting the identities of Maxine Carr, girlfriend of Soham murderer Ian Huntley, and Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, who killed two-year-old James Bulger in 1993.   



In detention: Convicted child murderer Mary Bell aged 16 The identity of Bell's 24-year-old daughter will also remain a secret until her dying day. The order protecting her has been updated by the High Court in London to include Bell's grandchild, who was referred to as 'Z'. Last night June Richardson, 64, whose four-year-old son Martin Brown was suffocated by Bell, said: 'A child is a blessing. 'She took my blessing and left me with grief for the rest of my life. I hope when she looks at this child she remembers the two she murdered. 'I will never see a grandchild from my son. I hope every time she looks at this baby she realises what my family are missing out on because of what she has done.'   



  



      Grief: Martin Brown was strangled by Bell when he was four. His mother, June Richardson says she has nothing left in her life but griefBell was convicted of manslaughter in December 1968 for suffocating Martin and Brian Howe, three, in Newcastle. Martin, of Scotswood, Newcastle, was found dead in a derelict house, while Brian's body was discovered on waste ground two months later with the letter M carved into his stomach with scissors. Bell's fellow accused, Norma Bell, 13, a neighbour who was not related to her, was acquitted. During the trial Norma gave evidence describing how Mary had ignored her pleas to stop hurting Brian Howe as she strangled him. The jury ruled Bell was suffering from diminished responsibility and therefore not guilty of murder. She received life in detention but was released at 23 and given a fresh identity to protect her daughter when she was born four years later, on May 25, 1984  -  16 years to the day after Martin died. She has had three assumed identities and has moved at least five times after being identified. In 1998, she was paid a reported £50,000 for collaborating with author Gitta Sereny's book, Cries Unheard, which detailed her life. She was tracked down amid calls for her right to anonymity to end. But in 2003 the double child killer and her 18-year-old daughter were granted the right to live anonymously for the rest of their lives after a High Court ruling that outraged her victims' families. Mrs Richardson said: 'It's all about her and how she has to be protected. As victims we are not given the same rights as killers.'

Child killer Mary Bell becomes a grandmother at 51: But all I have left is grief, says victim's mother

Child killer Mary Bell has become a grandmother, it emerged yesterday. Bell became notorious at 11 after being convicted of strangling two small boys 'solely for the pleasure and excitement' of killing. Now 51, the woman at the centre of one of the most sensational trials of the 20th century later won a court order giving her the right to anonymity for life. The ruling is similar to those protecting the identities of Maxine Carr, girlfriend of Soham murderer Ian Huntley, and Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, who killed two-year-old James Bulger in 1993.   



In detention: Convicted child murderer Mary Bell aged 16 The identity of Bell's 24-year-old daughter will also remain a secret until her dying day. The order protecting her has been updated by the High Court in London to include Bell's grandchild, who was referred to as 'Z'. Last night June Richardson, 64, whose four-year-old son Martin Brown was suffocated by Bell, said: 'A child is a blessing. 'She took my blessing and left me with grief for the rest of my life. I hope when she looks at this child she remembers the two she murdered. 'I will never see a grandchild from my son. I hope every time she looks at this baby she realises what my family are missing out on because of what she has done.'   



  



      Grief: Martin Brown was strangled by Bell when he was four. His mother, June Richardson says she has nothing left in her life but griefBell was convicted of manslaughter in December 1968 for suffocating Martin and Brian Howe, three, in Newcastle. Martin, of Scotswood, Newcastle, was found dead in a derelict house, while Brian's body was discovered on waste ground two months later with the letter M carved into his stomach with scissors. Bell's fellow accused, Norma Bell, 13, a neighbour who was not related to her, was acquitted. During the trial Norma gave evidence describing how Mary had ignored her pleas to stop hurting Brian Howe as she strangled him. The jury ruled Bell was suffering from diminished responsibility and therefore not guilty of murder. She received life in detention but was released at 23 and given a fresh identity to protect her daughter when she was born four years later, on May 25, 1984  -  16 years to the day after Martin died. She has had three assumed identities and has moved at least five times after being identified. In 1998, she was paid a reported £50,000 for collaborating with author Gitta Sereny's book, Cries Unheard, which detailed her life. She was tracked down amid calls for her right to anonymity to end. But in 2003 the double child killer and her 18-year-old daughter were granted the right to live anonymously for the rest of their lives after a High Court ruling that outraged her victims' families. Mrs Richardson said: 'It's all about her and how she has to be protected. As victims we are not given the same rights as killers.'
