The Fund invests primarily in a broad, dynamically managed portfolio of (i) senior secured loans (“Senior Loans”) made primarily to companies whose debt is rated below investment grade; (ii) corporate bonds (“Corporate Bonds”) that are primarily high yield issues rated below investment grade; (iii) other fixed-income instruments of a similar nature that may be represented by derivatives; and (iv) securities of collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”).
Advantages of a Dynamic Credit Strategy
Credit and economic environments don’t stay the same; neither should allocations.

Note: For Illustrative Purposes Only. The investment allocations in any given market environment will be determined by the investment adviser based on all relevant factors and may not match the examples set forth
Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the Fund’s Managed Assets (as defined below) will be invested in debt instruments, including (i) Senior Loans made primarily to companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, (ii) Corporate Bonds that are primarily high yield issues rated below investment grade, (iii) other fixed-income instruments of a similar nature that may be represented by derivatives, and (iv) debt and subordinated (or residual) securities issued by CLOs. The Fund expects that almost all of the senior loans and corporate bonds in which the Fund invests will be below investment grade. Corporate bonds rated below investment grade are often referred to as “high yield” securities. Senior Loans made to companies whose debt is rated below investment grade and high yield securities are often high risk and have speculative characteristics. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will not invest more than (i) 30% of its Managed Assets in securities issued by entities commonly referred to as CLOs (“CLO Securities”) and other asset-backed securities, or (ii) more than 7.5% of its Managed Assets in subordinated (or residual) tranches of CLO Securities. The Fund can invest in investment grade, below investment grade and non rated CLO Securities. The underlying obligations collateralizing such CLO  Securities will principally be Senior Loans, diversified by industry and borrower. "Managed Assets" means the total assets of the Fund (including any assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be issued or to indebtedness) minus the Fund’s liabilities other than liabilities relating to indebtedness.
Investment Process
Ares Capital Management II LLC (the “Adviser”) serves as the Fund’s investment adviser. The Adviser is an affiliate of Ares Management LLC (“Ares”). The Adviser’s investment philosophy, portfolio construction and portfolio management involve an assessment of the overall macroeconomic environment, financial markets and company specific research and analysis. Its investment approach emphasizes capital preservation, low volatility and minimization of downside risk. In addition to engaging in extensive due diligence from the perspective of a long-term investor, the Adviser’s approach seeks to reduce risk as further described below.
Leverage
The Fund may use leverage through borrowings, including loans from certain financial institutions and/ or the issuance of debt securities, as well as through the issuance of shares of preferred stock. The Fund has a revolving funding facility with an institutional lender, pursuant to which the Fund may borrow funds to make additional investments, subject to available collateral. The use of leverage is a speculative technique that involves special risks. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
Risks and Other Considerations
Investing in the Fund's common shares involves certain risks and the Fund may not be able to achieve its intended results for a variety of reasons. Because the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate, there is a risk that you will lose money. Your investment will decline in value if, among other things, the value of the Fund's investments decreases. The value of your common shares also will be affected by the Fund's ability to successfully implement its investment strategy, as well as by market, economic and other conditions. As with any security, complete loss of investment is possible.
Investors should consider the investment objective and policies, risk considerations, charges and ongoing expenses of an investment carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information relevant to an investment in the fund. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. To obtain a prospectus, please contact your investment representative or Destra Securities LLC at 877.287.9646 or access the documents page of this website.

About Ares

Market Leader. Experienced Team.
Flexible Approach. 

Ares Management, L.P. (“Ares” or the “Firm”) is a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager with approximately $100 billion of assets under management ("AUM") and approximately 955 employees. We seek to deliver attractive performance to our investor base across our investment groups and strategies, including credit, private equity and real estate. The firm is headquartered in Los Angeles with offices across the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia. Its common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "ARES".
Ares believes each of its investment groups is a market leader based on assets under management and investment performance. Our three distinct but complementary investment groups have the ability to invest in all levels of a company’s capital structure—from senior debt to common equity. The Firm was built upon the fundamental principle that each group benefits from being part of the broader platform. We believe the synergies from this multi‐asset strategy provide our professionals with insights into industry trends, access to significant deal flow and the ability to assess relative value.
Since our inception in 1997, we have adhered to a disciplined investment philosophy that focuses on delivering compelling risk‐adjusted investment returns throughout market cycles. We strive to maintain a consistent credit‐based approach in targeting well‐structured investments in high quality businesses and real estate assets. We believe our growth in becoming one of the largest alternative asset managers is a testament to our experienced management team, focus on performance and high quality investor base, which includes large pension funds, university endowments, sovereign wealth funds, banks and insurance companies. 
As of March 31, 2017,  AUM amounts include funds managed by Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P., a wholly owned portfolio company of Ares Capital Corporation and a registered investment adviser.   














As of March 31, 2017,  AUM amounts include funds managed by Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P., a wholly owned portfolio company of Ares Capital Corporation and a registered investment adviser. 
* Past performance is not indicative of future results; no representation is being made that any investment will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those achieved in the past, or that significant losses will be avoided. During the first quarter of 2016, we combined our Tradable Credit and Direct Lending Groups to form the Ares Credit Group. Effective July 1, 2016, we moved our Special Situations strategy from our Credit Group into our Private Equity Group.

      Based on the Fund’s current share price of $16.36 (as of its close on 
      July 11, 2017), the distribution represents an annualized distribution 
      rate of 7.70% (calculated by annualizing the distribution amount and 
      dividing it by the current price). Information regarding the 
      distribution rate is included for informational purposes only and is not 
      necessarily indicative of future results, the achievement of which 
      cannot be assured. The distribution rate should not be considered the 
      yield or total return on an investment in the Fund.


      The timing and amount of future distributions, if any, are at the 
      discretion of the Fund. As required by Section 19(a) of the Investment 
      Company Act of 1940, a notice will be distributed to the Fund’s 
      stockholders in the event that a portion of a monthly distribution is 
      derived from sources other than undistributed net investment income, 
      such as from short-term capital gain, long-term capital gain, or return 
      of capital. Such notices will also be posted on the Fund’s website at www.arespublicfunds.com.
    

      The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and 
      are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and 
      sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the 
      Fund’s investment performance during the remainder of its fiscal year 
      and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The final 
      determination of the source of these distributions will be made after 
      the Fund’s fiscal year end. If necessary, the Fund may elect to pay an 
      adjusting distribution in December that includes any additional income 
      and net realized capital gains in excess of the monthly distributions 
      for that year to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements of the 
      Internal Revenue Code. In January or February of each year, investors 
      will be sent a Form 1099-DIV for the previous calendar year that will 
      define how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.
    

      This press release is not intended to, and does not constitute, an offer 
      to purchase or sell shares of ARDC.

We will provide to any shareholder a hard copy of our most recent audited financial statements free of charge upon email request to ARDCInvestorRelations@aresmgmt.com.Investment Strategies and Policies
The Fund invests primarily in a broad, dynamically managed portfolio of (i) senior secured loans (“Senior Loans”) made primarily to companies whose debt is rated below investment grade; (ii) corporate bonds (“Corporate Bonds”) that are primarily high yield issues rated below investment grade; (iii) other fixed-income instruments of a similar nature that may be represented by derivatives; and (iv) securities of collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”).
Advantages of a Dynamic Credit Strategy
Credit and economic environments don’t stay the same; neither should allocations.

Note: For Illustrative Purposes Only. The investment allocations in any given market environment will be determined by the investment adviser based on all relevant factors and may not match the examples set forth
Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the Fund’s Managed Assets (as defined below) will be invested in debt instruments, including (i) Senior Loans made primarily to companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, (ii) Corporate Bonds that are primarily high yield issues rated below investment grade, (iii) other fixed-income instruments of a similar nature that may be represented by derivatives, and (iv) debt and subordinated (or residual) securities issued by CLOs. The Fund expects that almost all of the senior loans and corporate bonds in which the Fund invests will be below investment grade. Corporate bonds rated below investment grade are often referred to as “high yield” securities. Senior Loans made to companies whose debt is rated below investment grade and high yield securities are often high risk and have speculative characteristics. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will not invest more than (i) 30% of its Managed Assets in securities issued by entities commonly referred to as CLOs (“CLO Securities”) and other asset-backed securities, or (ii) more than 7.5% of its Managed Assets in subordinated (or residual) tranches of CLO Securities. The Fund can invest in investment grade, below investment grade and non rated CLO Securities. The underlying obligations collateralizing such CLO  Securities will principally be Senior Loans, diversified by industry and borrower. "Managed Assets" means the total assets of the Fund (including any assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be issued or to indebtedness) minus the Fund’s liabilities other than liabilities relating to indebtedness.
Investment Process
Ares Capital Management II LLC (the “Adviser”) serves as the Fund’s investment adviser. The Adviser is an affiliate of Ares Management LLC (“Ares”). The Adviser’s investment philosophy, portfolio construction and portfolio management involve an assessment of the overall macroeconomic environment, financial markets and company specific research and analysis. Its investment approach emphasizes capital preservation, low volatility and minimization of downside risk. In addition to engaging in extensive due diligence from the perspective of a long-term investor, the Adviser’s approach seeks to reduce risk as further described below.
Leverage
The Fund may use leverage through borrowings, including loans from certain financial institutions and/ or the issuance of debt securities, as well as through the issuance of shares of preferred stock. The Fund has a revolving funding facility with an institutional lender, pursuant to which the Fund may borrow funds to make additional investments, subject to available collateral. The use of leverage is a speculative technique that involves special risks. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
Risks and Other Considerations
Investing in the Fund's common shares involves certain risks and the Fund may not be able to achieve its intended results for a variety of reasons. Because the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate, there is a risk that you will lose money. Your investment will decline in value if, among other things, the value of the Fund's investments decreases. The value of your common shares also will be affected by the Fund's ability to successfully implement its investment strategy, as well as by market, economic and other conditions. As with any security, complete loss of investment is possible.
Investors should consider the investment objective and policies, risk considerations, charges and ongoing expenses of an investment carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information relevant to an investment in the fund. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. To obtain a prospectus, please contact your investment representative or Destra Securities LLC at 877.287.9646 or access the documents page of this website.

Ares Dynamic Credit Allocation Fund Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 7.63% Yield (ARDC)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Ares Dynamic Credit Allocation Fund Declares Monthly Distributions Of $0.1050 Per Share






Business Wire




Jul 13, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Ares Dynamic Credit Allocation Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") (NYSE:ARDC) announced an increase to its monthly distribution rate from the previous rate of $0.1025 per common share to $0.1050 per common share in order to better align the Funds' distribution rate with its current and projected level of earnings. The declaration of monthly distributions for the next three months is payable as noted below.                                               Ex-Date:           July 20, 2017           August 22, 2017           September 19, 2017     Record Date:       July 24, 2017       August 24, 2017       September 21, 2017     Payable Date:       July 31, 2017       August 31, 2017       September 29, 2017     Per Share Amount:           $0.1050           $0.1050           $0.1050                              Based on the Fund's current share price of $16.36 (as of its close on July 11, 2017), the distribution represents an annualized distribution rate of 7.70% (calculated by annualizing the distribution amount and dividing it by the current price). Information regarding the distribution rate is included for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of future results, the achievement of which cannot be assured. The distribution rate should not be considered the yield or total return on an investment in the Fund.  The timing and amount of future distributions, if any, are at the discretion of the Fund. As required by Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a notice will be distributed to the Fund's stockholders in the event that a portion of a monthly distribution is derived from sources other than undistributed net investment income, such as from short-term capital gain, long-term capital gain, or return of capital. Such notices will also be posted on the Fund's website at www.arespublicfunds.com.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment performance during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The final determination of the source of these distributions will be made after the Fund's fiscal year end. If necessary, the Fund may elect to pay an adjusting distribution in December that includes any additional income and net realized capital gains in excess of the monthly distributions for that year to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. In January or February of each year, investors will be sent a Form 1099-DIV for the previous calendar year that will define how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information. The information provided herein may be displayed and printed for your internal use only and may not reproduced, retransmitted, distributed, disseminated, sold, published, broadcast or circulated to anyone without the express written consent of Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online.


Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.

    investment strategy.
