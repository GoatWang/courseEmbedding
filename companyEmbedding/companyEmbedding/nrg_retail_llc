What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NRG Retail, a division of NRG Energy, Inc., today announced that the NRG 
      Go solution, a patent-pending portable power technology, was named a CES 
      2016 Innovation Awards Honoree. In the way retail and consumer-driven 
      on-demand business models such as Redbox and Citi Bike developed to 
      bring convenient entertainment options and expand urban transportation 
      networks, the NRG Go solution brings next-generation convenience of 
      power on the go so consumers can continue using their phones when most 
      needed. With NRG Go, consumers low on phone battery no longer have to 
      worry about missing out on conversations, downloading helpful 
      information, sharing photos and videos of spontaneous moments and other 
      interactions they have come to expect in their daily lives.
    


      The NRG Go solution, provided by NRG Portable Power LLC, allows 
      customers to rent a power pack from a self-service station, charge their 
      mobile device and return the palm-sized unit at any NRG Go station. The 
      charging technology works with all iPhone® 5 and later models 
      as well as most Android™ devices. As the power pack is 
      entirely portable, users do not need additional cables or outlets, 
      giving NRG’s retail customers and other consumers power when they need 
      it most.
    

      “We are excited to receive this honor recognizing our work to create a 
      new, convenient way for us to put power into the hands of our 
      customers,” said Elizabeth Killinger, president, NRG Retail and Reliant. 
      “Our NRG Go solution is an example of how we are extending the deep 
      relationship we have with our customers to provide them power on the go 
      which is increasingly more important given the mobile, connected 
      lifestyle that has become the norm.”
    

      The NRG Go solution offers users an intuitive experience that comes in 
      two sizes. The full-size station is a 75-inch-tall tower fitted with a 
      27-inch touchscreen and 120 rentable lithium-ion power packs stacked 
      along the tower’s sides. Mini stations, capable of wall mounting, have 
      two charging racks that hold 15 power packs each. Both versions 
      automatically recharge power packs upon return, and customers also have 
      the option to purchase the power pack instead of renting it.
    

      “Our NRG Go solution is a lifesaver for consumers spending time at 
      universities, hotels and tourist destinations, stadiums, bars and 
      entertainment venues, shopping malls and more,” said Adam Runquist, 
      director, NRG Retail. “NRG Go is a refreshing solution to every 
      consumer’s digital nightmare: a dead phone. So much of our lives depend 
      on mobile devices and this solution is designed to save the day – 
      providing power when and where people need it most.”
    

      The NRG Go solution will be on display at the International Consumer 
      Electronics Show (January 6-9, 2016) in Las Vegas at the Innovation 
      Awards Showcase at Tech West, Sands Convention Center, Level 1, at Booth 
      #833139. The showcase will include honorees across 27 categories, each 
      recognized for outstanding design and engineering in consumer technology 
      products. More information on the products is available at CESweb.org/Innovation.
    

      The CES Innovation Awards are sponsored by the Consumer Technology 
      Association (CTA)™ and judged by a preeminent panel of independent 
      industrial designers, independent engineers and members of the trade 
      media to honor outstanding design and engineering in cutting-edge 
      consumer electronics, based upon descriptive materials submitted to the 
      judges. The Consumer Electronics Association, the producer of CES, did 
      not verify the accuracy of any submission or of any claims made and did 
      not test the item to which the award was given.

NRG Launching New Retail Brand to Engage Customers to Think Differently About Energy, Offering Customization, 2-Cent Sundays, NFL-Themed Products
August 29, 2013

Email This Story
Copyright 2010-13 EnergyChoiceMatters.com
Reporting by Paul Ring • ring@energychoicematters.com
Update 9/4 NRG Energy officially launched NRG Residential Solutions today.  In the official announcement, NRG also mentioned, "innovations still in development, such as the NRG Clean Power Advisor, a smartphone app that will help customers decide when to run their electric appliances to lower their carbon footprint."


Originally published 8/29:

NRG Energy is officially launching NRG Residential Solutions, a new retail energy brand designed to engage customers and to get them to think differently about buying energy supply.
The forthcoming launch of NRG Residential Solutions, and the offering of a 2-cent Sunday product and NFL-themed products, had exclusively been first reported by EnergyChoiceMatters.com in July.  NRG Residential Solutions is a new trade name for Reliant Energy Northeast LLC.
NRG Residential Solutions is currently offering residential electric service at PECO and PPL in Pennsylvania and PSE&G, Jersey Central Power & Light, and Atlantic City Electric in New Jersey.  A formal launch will occur in mid-September.
Jim Steffes, Retail Regional President, Northeast, for NRG Energy, said that NRG Residential Solutions will ultimately expand to the rest of the Northeast during the rest of this year and next year, citing in particular Massachusetts, Maryland, and the District of Columbia.
One of the prominent programs offered by NRG Residential Solutions is "2¢ Sundays," which is a program which, in a one-time rebate after 6 months, provides a rebate to the customer based on if they had been charged 2¢/kWh for their Sunday usage for those first six months versus the otherwise applicable rate.  The 2 Cent Sundays rebate program is featured as a part of all of NRG Residential Solutions' specific electric plans.
The 2 Cent Sundays rebate program currently relies on utility load profiles to determine the customer's Sunday usage for purposes of the rebate, even at utilities such as PPL where AMI interval data is available.  
Steffes said that as smart meter deployment becomes more ubiquitous, NRG Residential Solutions will be engaging customers through a variety of dynamically priced product offerings relying on actual interval data.
The 2 Cent Sundays program was chosen initially to start a conversation with customers (asking customers to give NRG their "two cents" about how energy should be done differently), and to spark customers to think differently about buying power.  Sunday was chosen due to it being NFL gameday, and to leverage NRG's existing partnerships (distributed solar, sponsorship, etc.) with several NFL teams and venues (noted further below).
As part of listening to customers' two cents, NRG Residential Solutions emphasizes, in addition to several standard products, a broad ability for customers to not only customize their term length or renewable content, but to also choose their level of cash back rewards, and enrollment bonus.
Specifically, under the custom offers offered by NRG Residential Solutions, customers are presented with a decision tree allowing them to select:
• The amount of an enrollment bonus: $25 after 3 months, $50 after 6 months, or $100 after 12 months
• The amount of cash back rewards: 1% quarterly, 3% semi-annually, or 5% annually
• The term length of the product: 3, 6, 9, or 12 months (the 3 month product is month-to-month variable with 3 months of promotional pricing; the remaining products are term products with fixed pricing)
• The renewable content: 0%, 25%, 50%, or 100%
The 2-cent Sundays rebate program is automatically offered with all of the choices the customer can make during customization.
At PECO, a 12-month fixed plan with a $100 enrollment bonus, 5% cash back annually, 2-cent Sundays program, and 0% green includes a fixed price of 9.400¢ per kWh.  
At PECO, a 12-month fixed plan with a $25 enrollment bonus, 1% quarterly cash back, 2-cent Sundays program, and 0% green includes a fixed price of 9.200¢ per kWh.  
NRG Residential Solutions offers three standard products in addition to the customization option.  These products are an Eagles Fan plan, a Learn & Conserve Nest thermostat plan, and an Essentials plan.  All three plans include 2¢ Sunday rebates and 1% cash back quarterly.
The Eagles Fan plan also includes an authentic Philadelphia Eagles Helmet, 25% green energy, and a 12-month fixed rate.  At PECO, the price of the Eagles Fan plan is 9.600¢/kWh.  
The Learn & Conserve plan also includes a free Nest Learning thermostat, 25% green energy, and a 15-month fixed rate. At PECO, the price of the Learn & Conserve plan is 9.800¢/kWh.  
The Essentials plan also includes a $25 enrollment bonus and a monthly variable rate, with three months of promotional pricing. At PECO, the price of the Essentials plan is 7.800¢/kWh for the first 3 months.  
Steffes said that the Eagles plan, and similarly themed programs with other teams expected to be launched in the future, is designed to leverage NRG's existing relationships with NFL teams and venues.  NRG Residential Solutions will continue to develop products to engage NFL fans, and will support the products through a variety of channels to engage customers on gameday at the stadiums.
In addition to the Eagles, NRG has a series of partnerships or sponsorships, including the placement of solar generation, at facilities used by the Patriots, Redskins, Giants, and Jets.
Ultimately, Steffes said that NRG Residential Solutions will approach the broad ecosystem of customers' energy usage and needs, and develop new products and services accordingly.  Within this "lens" of the customer's energy ecosystem is natural gas supply, and distributed solar solutions, Steffes said.  No definitive product offerings in these business lines were ready to be announced.
For all of the fixed products listed above, an early cancellation fee of $10 per month remaining on the term of the agreement applies.  There is no early termination fee for the month-to-month product with three months fixed introductory pricing.
The cash back applies to the supply portion of the bill.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
