Economic Incentives
































WDGC’s Incentives Consulting Practice was established in 2009 to complete our menu of corporate Site Selection services. Although incentives should never “drive” the location decision, these cost offsets can be instrumental toward the short- and long-term success of a project.
















Potential Economic Development Incentives include: 














Cash Grants





Tax Credits (Refundable, Transferrable)





Payroll Tax Rebates





Real & Personal Property Tax Savings





Sales & Use Tax Exemptions





Discounted Land Purchase or Rent Concessions





R&D Tax Credits





Reduced Rate Financing or Forgivable Loans





Training Funds

















Employee Recruitment Assistance





Utility Riders 





Tax Increment Financing





Industrial Revenue Bonds





Development Fee Reductions





Expedited Permitting and Approvals





Site and Infrastructure Preparation Assistance





Special Benefit Districts:











Empowerment Zones





Enterprise Zones





Foreign Trade Zones
























Stage One: Identification of Applicable Programs & Estimation of Potential Benefits 



WDGC begins exploring potential incentives once a Longlist (often 7-8) of qualified locations emerges from a systematic Screening Process. Potential incentive values become integrated with other cost factors to help narrow the contending area to a Shortlist (frequently 3-4). WDGC conducts first hand assessment in shortlisted locations. We strive to validate operating conditions including human resources, transportation, infrastructure, business costs, etc. Non-binding incentives quotations are submitted by local and state economic development agencies. Possible savings are estimated and infused into our Comparative Cost Analysis.Balancing cost and qualitative considerations, WDGC and the client reach a decision on the top location and best alternate. Formal incentives negotiations are then undertaken in finalist locations.










Stage Two: Formal Negotiations in Finalist Locations 



Building upon the preliminary incentives estimates derived earlier in the site selection process, WDGC can now engage in direct, formal negotiations with appropriate organizations. These include EDOs, government agencies, utility companies, and education/training institutions.Typically a significant proportion of an incentives package will be tied to a specific site(s). Consequently, WDGC works closely with the client’s Real Estate, Engineering, and Environmental team members. We also interface with additional players including Operations, Technology, Finance, Legal, and Corporate Affairs. Throughout negotiations WDGC submits requests, critiques responses, engages in dialogue to enhance offers in writing, and projects multi-year savings (10-Year NPV Cash Flows).
















Stage Three: Submit Application(s) and Execute Final Agreement (Administration) 



The incentive team works with a client’s project team to compile information and prepare all required Incentives Applications and a Formal Request for Incentives to be used in negotiations. WDGC then facilitates the Government Approvals, the drafting and Client Review of legal incentive agreements, and finalization of the incentives Procurement Process.Since the approval of incentive benefits is typically based on the project’s formal commitment for job creation/retention and new capital investment, incentive recipients are required to provide Progress Updates. As part of the incentives negotiations process, WDGC advises the client on the respective annual incentive Compliance Reporting, including government Contact Information, Sample Forms, and Trigger Dates for multi-year incentive compliance requirements.Unless WDGC has been retained to provide optional Stage Four services, the formal compliance monitoring and reporting is handled by the client’s Accounting, Tax or HR Personnel, with the WDGC team available to field questions.










Stage Four: Program Compliance (optional service) 



Once incentives are negotiated, formal commitments are established, applications submitted and approved, and legal agreements finalized, WDGC can set up formalized procedures to monitor Incentives Compliance metrics and follow-through requirements on the agreed upon commitment terms. Stage Four activities can include:Setting up incentives administration and monitoring procedures relative to the terms of the incentives agreements, including reporting Deadline Reminders, assistance with Reporting Certifications (Audits), Application Renewals, and other jurisdictional requirements at prescribed times.Assessing the Opportunity to the company of new job and investment creation, as well as the impact of Claw Backs if job and investment thresholds are not met within time requirements established in the initial agreements.Periodic assessment of incentives Program Changes that may impact existing agreements or provide new opportunities as the company’s local strategy unfolds.

















We're Here to Help 



WDGC stands ready to guide you through the alignment process to ensure that the overall site selection process advances your business objectives. Our role is flexible, we can either lead to the study team or provide selected expertise (e.g., labor market metrics) as a dedicated team member.

A site of at least 75 acres to accommodate 400 jobs in a market with an existing industry ecosystem and deep talent resources.

Client secured $60M in incentives and has undergone two subsequent expansions.
















Viewed as one of most successful sites in Squibb’s global footprint.

















 































Roche’s site for its Translational Clinical Research Center in NJ was sold and relocation was necessary.

























WDGC examined both local (w/in tristate area) and longer-distance options’ feasibility.



















Long-distance move would incur high HR/attrition costs, so local move recommended by WDGC. Access to talent sited the project in Manhattan.



















Roche followed WDGC recommendation and has been highly satisfied with location decision
















Roche received $6.6M in incentives from NY to equip its new research labs.
















Distribution Centers 
















 































Target had an extremely short timeline to validate the viability of the Memphis Metro for a 1,000 employee online fulfillment center.

























WDGC conducted in-depth research on the roster of existing employers as well as recent corporate growth activity to gauge supply/demand balance of labor resources.



















WDGC advised that for a market as competitive for distribution as Memphis, Target wouldhave  to pay at or above market wages to find success.



















Target invested over $50M in their new DC in southeast Memphis, near the Mississippi state line.
















WDGC negotiated $27M in state and local incentives for Target Memphis.


















 































ULTA required a West Coast Distribution Center for expanding E-Commerce business that would employ 1,300 at peak staffing.

























WDGC was tasked with determining the viability of two San Joaquin Valley cities to support both full-time and seasonal hiring needs.



















WDGC recommended Fresno due to its large underemployed labor pool and seasonal workforce.



















ULTA selected Fresno and announced a $110M capital investment with hopes to be operational in 2018.
















ULTA was awarded $26M in state and local incentives for the project.

















Contact Centers 
















 































ADP required the establishment of a Western U.S. B2B service center.

























WDGC conducted a western location screen yielding a longlist of 8 metros. Refined search criteria delivered a shortlist of 3 areas.



















WDGC recommended El Paso. At target wage levels, ADP sits at top of BPO food-chain. Notable concentration of feeder centers was a plus despite saturation.



















Company staffed 1,000 in two years. Excellent staffing experience with favorable operating costs motivated ADP to add 1,000-1,500 over 5 years.
















Cost savings of 24% vs. the existing location were achieved.

















 































DS Services sought anew service center thatrequired 580 hires injust 3 months with costsavings vs. Atlanta.

























WDGC constructed ascreen that wouldlocate areas with asurplus of labor andlow costs to quicklyaccommodate the newservice center.



















Lakeland, FL wasrecommended byWDGC as the optimallocation for thisproject.



















DS Services was able tofully staff under anaggressive ramp-up,and achieved targetedoperating costs whilesecuring employer-of-choice status.
















DS Services saved 27% on annual operating costs vs. Atlanta/L.A.
















Office Operations 
















 































Marriott required a 300 FTE shared-service center with at least 10% labor savings vs. the U.S. average.

























A two-phase study examined both statistical and field-discovered elements. A mix of entry and experienced talent was required to staff the center in 18 months.



















An available building of 40,000 SF and surplus labor resources at targeted cost objectives led WDGC to recommend Knoxville.



















Client has enjoyed success in Knoxville, and staffing now exceeds 600.
















Wage levels 12% below those forecast in business plan.

















 































CNA Insurance in need of a Western U.S. Operations Center in a location with costs below Tier One metros.

























New center required 300 FTE in claims, service, and help desk. WDGC screened from 50+ western metros and performed fieldwork in three areas.



















WDGC recommended Denver’s southwest submarket. Recommended location to capitalize on recession-depressed labor market.



















Operation has been successful in Denver; 300 positions readily filled and operating at less than 20% turnover.
















Cost savings of 17% vs. existing location benchmark.
















Technology Centers 
















 































Canon IT Services required a western center for camera-user tech support.

























WDGC prioritized finding a location with moderate costs for both service and technical help-desk roles.



















Albuquerque was recommended for its underemployed tech base, moderate costs, and local creative industry cluster fostered by UNM.



















Canon’s advanced tech support center staffed 150 positions while achieving employer-of-choice status in the marketplace.
















Canon has successfully leveraged Albuquerque's creative tech pipeline.

















 































Barclays Capital sought new locations for 1,300 U.S. HQ operations staff, strongly-driven by IT skill needs.

























This project aimed to decentralize three primary functions from Manhattan to areas where each could have growth flexibility and significant cost reduction.



















WDGC recommended relocating transactions to Delaware, middle office functions to northern NJ, and IT functions to Dallas.



















Barclays move-related attrition was within projected manageable levels (38%-54%).
















Client now has significant geographic flexibility for future deployment.
















Corporate Headquarters 
















 































CitiBank sought to consolidate 17,000+ employees across six NYC/NJ worksites into one NYC metro worksite.

























WDGC conducted an in-depth commute study to find which new site had the minimum negative commute impacts for existing regional workforce.



















The existing worksite at 388 Greenwich in Manhattan posed no red flags, and was eventually selected primarily for real estate considerations.



















CitiBank invested over $20M to retrofit the 3 million SF space in Lower Manhattan.
















Relocation attrition minimized to new NYC worksite.

















 































Verizon decided to consolidate HQ functions (except C-suite) and middle office totaling 2,200 employees.

























WDGC analyzed several relocation scenarios including greenfield option. Existing sites in NYC, Pitt, Boston and NJ offered options as well.



















WDGC recommended consolidation at existing site in Central New Jersey where Verizon had room to expand. 



















Substantial one-time costs from HR move were easily mitigated by savings from consolidation efficiencies and geographic wage differentials.
















Relocation justified on cost basis, and harmonization of consolidated functions.
















Manufacturing Facilities 
















 































IBM partnered with Toshiba to produce computer chips, sought to invest $1.7B in the new facility.

























WDGC undertook a national greenfield search in addition to considering two existing sites for new fabrication plant which would house 1,300 well-paying jobs.



















Four greenfield sites emerged as viable, but ultimately WDGC recommended IBM co-locate at a company controlled site in Manassas, VA.



















Manassas site proved to be optimal, as site’s embedded infrastructure saved 35% on capital costs and 6 month reduction in construction time.
















Several expansions have taken place over past decade at the site. Dominion subsequently purchased by Micron.

















 































Beretta sought to relocate from capped-out site and escape legislative concerns in Maryland.

























WDGC conducted a multi-state location screen for optimum available metalworking skills with an acceptable state political climate.



















Project located near Nashville (Gallatin); U.S. HQ and testing range will subsequently co-locate in near future.



















Nashville proved to be a great fit for Beretta’s 500+ jobs and $75M in capital investment.
















Phase One incentives package of $15M was icing on the cake.

Marriott required a 300 FTE shared-service center with at least 10% labor savings vs. the U.S. average.

























A two-phase study examined both statistical and field-discovered elements. A mix of entry and experienced talent was required to staff the center in 18 months.



















An available building of 40,000 SF and surplus labor resources at targeted cost objectives led WDGC to recommend Knoxville.



















Client has enjoyed success in Knoxville, and staffing now exceeds 600.
















Wage levels 12% below those forecast in business plan.

















 































CNA Insurance in need of a Western U.S. Operations Center in a location with costs below Tier One metros.

























New center required 300 FTE in claims, service, and help desk. WDGC screened from 50+ western metros and performed fieldwork in three areas.



















WDGC recommended Denver’s southwest submarket. Recommended location to capitalize on recession-depressed labor market.



















Operation has been successful in Denver; 300 positions readily filled and operating at less than 20% turnover.
















Cost savings of 17% vs. existing location benchmark.
















Technology Centers 
















 































Canon IT Services required a western center for camera-user tech support.

























WDGC prioritized finding a location with moderate costs for both service and technical help-desk roles.



















Albuquerque was recommended for its underemployed tech base, moderate costs, and local creative industry cluster fostered by UNM.



















Canon’s advanced tech support center staffed 150 positions while achieving employer-of-choice status in the marketplace.
















Canon has successfully leveraged Albuquerque's creative tech pipeline.

















 































Barclays Capital sought new locations for 1,300 U.S. HQ operations staff, strongly-driven by IT skill needs.

























This project aimed to decentralize three primary functions from Manhattan to areas where each could have growth flexibility and significant cost reduction.



















WDGC recommended relocating transactions to Delaware, middle office functions to northern NJ, and IT functions to Dallas.



















Barclays move-related attrition was within projected manageable levels (38%-54%).
















Client now has significant geographic flexibility for future deployment.
















Corporate Headquarters 
















 































CitiBank sought to consolidate 17,000+ employees across six NYC/NJ worksites into one NYC metro worksite.

























WDGC conducted an in-depth commute study to find which new site had the minimum negative commute impacts for existing regional workforce.



















The existing worksite at 388 Greenwich in Manhattan posed no red flags, and was eventually selected primarily for real estate considerations.



















CitiBank invested over $20M to retrofit the 3 million SF space in Lower Manhattan.
















Relocation attrition minimized to new NYC worksite.

















 































Verizon decided to consolidate HQ functions (except C-suite) and middle office totaling 2,200 employees.

























WDGC analyzed several relocation scenarios including greenfield option. Existing sites in NYC, Pitt, Boston and NJ offered options as well.



















WDGC recommended consolidation at existing site in Central New Jersey where Verizon had room to expand. 



















Substantial one-time costs from HR move were easily mitigated by savings from consolidation efficiencies and geographic wage differentials.
















Relocation justified on cost basis, and harmonization of consolidated functions.
















Manufacturing Facilities 
















 































IBM partnered with Toshiba to produce computer chips, sought to invest $1.7B in the new facility.

























WDGC undertook a national greenfield search in addition to considering two existing sites for new fabrication plant which would house 1,300 well-paying jobs.



















Four greenfield sites emerged as viable, but ultimately WDGC recommended IBM co-locate at a company controlled site in Manassas, VA.



















Manassas site proved to be optimal, as site’s embedded infrastructure saved 35% on capital costs and 6 month reduction in construction time.
















Several expansions have taken place over past decade at the site. Dominion subsequently purchased by Micron.

















 































Beretta sought to relocate from capped-out site and escape legislative concerns in Maryland.

























WDGC conducted a multi-state location screen for optimum available metalworking skills with an acceptable state political climate.



















Project located near Nashville (Gallatin); U.S. HQ and testing range will subsequently co-locate in near future.



















Nashville proved to be a great fit for Beretta’s 500+ jobs and $75M in capital investment.
















Phase One incentives package of $15M was icing on the cake.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

So, if your invention is great like you say it is, and we choose to represent you, all other costs for seeking a license deal will be paid by us!
There are no hidden charges, no large up-front fees, just a no-risk-high-reward offer that we are making to those with great inventions!

Our Services
There are many financial products in the market, and so choosing the ones that best meet an individual client’s needs can be complicated.  
 










 

Investments
We work diligently to gain a holistic understanding of your financial resources and goals so we can design and implement strategies tailored to meet your individual investment needs. 






 

Estate and Succession Planning
You have worked hard to build and retain your wealth. A well designed estate and gifting plan can provide tremendous asset protection, ensure your assets transfer to your intended beneficiaries when and how you want them to, and reduce or eliminate the risk of paying estate tax.






 

Retirement Planning
Retirement planning today has taken on many new dimensions that never had to be considered by earlier generations.







 

Managing Your Finances
Managing your finances is an important component to any financial security plan. Money management strategies help you manage your savings on a daily basis.






 

Asset Allocation
Asset allocation is the process of selecting a mix of asset classes that closely matches an investor’s financial profile in terms of their investment preferences and tolerance for risk.






 

Business Succession Planning
The death of a partner or major stockholder in a business can have devastating effects on both the business and the deceased partner’s surviving family.







 

Charitable Giving
Everyone has their own reason for gifting their assets or a portion of their income to charitable organizations. Some find comfort in helping others who are less fortunate, while others simply want to share their good fortune.

Should You Have a Living Trust?


Feb 29, 2016 by Diligent Investors, LLC


A will is the foundation of your estate plan and it is essential if your financial affairs are to be settled in accordance with your wishes. If you die without a will, or “intestate” as the law refers to it, essentially the state becomes your executor and your property will be distributed according to its laws. Drawing up a will has become so easy, and it is relatively inexpensive, leaving very little reason why everyone shouldn’t have one. The question becomes whether you...
