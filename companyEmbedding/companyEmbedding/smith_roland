  "Roland is uniquely qualified for the newly combined Office        Depot and OfficeMax. He has decades of experience integrating companies        and cultures and an impressive track record in turning around        businesses. Additionally, he brings outstanding leadership that will be        invaluable as we seek to transform and grow our new company." 



BOCA RATON, Fla. & NAPERVILLE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Office Depot, Inc. (NYSE:ODP), a leading global provider of office 
      products, services, and solutions formed by the merger of Office 
      Depot and OfficeMax, today announced the appointment of Roland C. Smith 
      as Chairman and CEO, effective immediately.
    

      An experienced senior executive, having served as President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of public and private companies and on numerous 
      boards, Smith comes to Office Depot, Inc. with a strong retail track 
      record of increasing operating profit, managing complex integrations, 
      directing corporate turnarounds, and transforming companies for future 
      success.
    

      Most recently, Smith was the Chief Executive Officer and President of 
      Delhaize America, LLC, which is the U.S. division of Delhaize Group. 
      Delhaize America produces over $18 billion in annual revenue through its 
      U.S. supermarkets, including Food Lion and Hannaford, and represents 
      approximately 65% of the revenue of the Delhaize Group. While at 
      Delhaize, Smith orchestrated the successful integration of the major 
      supermarket chains owned by Delhaize, including successful dispositions 
      of three of the chains thereby materially improving profitability and 
      driving substantial shareholder value creation at Delhaize Group.
    

      Previously, Smith was President and CEO of The Wendy’s Company; 
      President and CEO of Wendy's/Arby's Group, Inc.; and CEO of Wendy's 
      International, Inc. Throughout his tenure at these companies, Smith 
      orchestrated numerous transformative initiatives. Originally at Arby’s, 
      Smith helped to rejuvenate the brand, turn around the culture, and 
      integrate the acquisition of its largest franchisee. Later, Smith 
      successfully completed the acquisition and merger of Wendy’s by Arby’s. 
      While transforming the culture, menu, and product, Smith also improved 
      operations and accelerated international expansion. Additionally, Smith 
      orchestrated the successful sale of Arby’s.
    

      Smith also led operational turnarounds at American Golf Corporation, the 
      world’s largest owner and operator of golf courses, and AMF, the world’s 
      largest owner and operator of bowling centers.
    

      “I am honored to accept the position of Chairman and CEO of Office 
      Depot, Inc.,” said Smith. “With the combined resources of Office Depot 
      and OfficeMax, we have the ability to transform the company and create 
      an exciting new organization that exceeds the needs and desires of our 
      customers, provides new opportunities for our global associates, becomes 
      a more appealing partner to our vendors, and increases value for our 
      shareholders.”
    

      Added Smith, “I know that numerous cross-company teams have worked 
      diligently over the past eight months to create a clear blueprint for 
      the integration of Office Depot and OfficeMax. Moving forward, my focus 
      will be on fully integrating the two companies, achieving the planned 
      synergies, creating a compelling vision for the future, and leveraging 
      our infrastructure and assets to drive improved profitability and 
      increased revenue. Additionally, I fully understand that we need to make 
      a headquarters decision quickly so that we can drive our integration 
      efforts.”
    

      “Over the last several months, the Selection Committee evaluated more 
      than 100 candidates in a rigorous process to find the right leader for 
      this company,” stated Office Depot, Inc. Lead Director Nigel Travis, 
      co-chair of the CEO Selection Committee, and Chairman and CEO of Dunkin’ 
      Brands. “Roland is uniquely qualified for the newly combined Office 
      Depot and OfficeMax. He has decades of experience integrating companies 
      and cultures and an impressive track record in turning around 
      businesses. Additionally, he brings outstanding leadership that will be 
      invaluable as we seek to transform and grow our new company.”
    

      “We are pleased to add a talented executive of Smith’s caliber to lead 
      our combined organization as we enhance our position in the rapidly 
      changing office solutions marketplace,” added Office Depot, Inc. Board 
      Member Jim Marino, co-chair of the CEO Selection Committee, and former 
      President and CEO of Alberto Culver Company. “Roland is a proven leader 
      with the strategic insight and operational discipline necessary to drive 
      our business forward and deliver the synergies that come from combining 
      these two great companies. We are fortunate to have hired the right 
      person for this unique opportunity.”
    

      Office Depot, Inc. also announced that as a result of Smith’s 
      appointment as Chairman and CEO, Neil Austrian and Ravi Saligram, 
      formerly co-CEOs of Office Depot, Inc. have resigned from the company 
      and Board. Aside from Smith, the company’s 11-person board includes 
      Warren Bryant, Rakesh Gangwal, Cynthia Jamison, Jim Marino, Michael 
      Massey, Francesca Ruiz de Luzuriaga, Jeff Smith, David Szymanski, Nigel 
      Travis and Joseph Vassalluzzo. Travis has been named Lead Director of 
      the Board.
    

      The company and Board wish to recognize Austrian and Saligram for their 
      pivotal leadership and many significant contributions to the 
      transformative merger of Office Depot and OfficeMax. Austrian and 
      Saligram have provided overall sponsorship and stewardship of the 
      complex integration planning process with the objective of ensuring a 
      smooth and productive transition for the company’s many stakeholders.

Jack then discovers the reason these men have come into their lives-his father has been arrested for drug trafficking.Jack, his mother, and his sister are then forced to enter Witness Security Program. Jack becomes "Zach" and moves to Elko, Nevada, a town in the middle of nowhere. There he meets Sam, the strangest school custodian he has ever encountered, and Catalin, a girl who might make Zach's uprooting worth the trouble. But just as Zach finally begins to piece together a new life, he finds himself in danger again-and this time his actions could determine the fates of everyone he cares about.

My 12-year-old son brought this home from school last week as required reading for a class. The title summoned fears that it might be a bent book, so I had to examine it. After the first page, I was hooked! I had to find out how and what and why... and who. I felt like a detective looking for clues to piece the puzzle together at first, then on the edge of my seat as a spectator anticipating the worst but hoping for the best.

My 12-year-old son brought this home from school last week as required reading for a class. The title summoned fears that it might be a bent book, so I had to examine it. After the first page, I was hooked! I had to find out how and what and why... and who. I felt like a detective looking for clues to piece the puzzle together at first, then on the edge of my seat as a spectator anticipating the worst but hoping for the best. My children heard me cry out in several parts in surprise and dismay as "the bad guys" found the family and made their evil plans.The "lie" referred to in the title is that the family has to be relocated through the "witness security program" and change their identities in order to protect themselves. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and now have more confidence in my son's teacher and her choice of novels for youth because I think this one's a clincher to keep their attention and they may vicariously experience life lessons through it. My favorite character was "Sam," the custodian. He felt real, human, and trustworthy from the get go. Oh, if every young man could have a mentor like him!

First, his name is Jack, not Zach. But he’ll never be able to use “Jack” again. Never. Second, some guys broke into his house and duct-taped his mother, his sister and Jack on the couch. Then they held a phone up to his mom - and told her the only thing she could say to Jack’s father on the other end: they will kill us if you talk. When the police found them, they were happy. When the DEA found them a little later, they were shocked. Jack had no idea what was happening or had happened with his Dad to so completely mess up the family.But that’s the way it was. Jack and his family (except for his Dad who's still in jail talking to the DEA) fly to parts unknown, start new lives with new names, and live a lie. Jack meets other kids at school but has to watch what he says: he's Zach now, and anything he says might put his family in jeopardy - just like his dad did. He must avoid this, but it's not easy to blend in when you're worried that anything you say will blow your cover. What parts of the lies he has to live now will hold up?

The land of books is the best for escape, especially action stories. A straightforward tale full of bad guys and excitement is sometimes the best medicine.Now, as a more educated reader, I can say no, it was not the most educational read. What can i say? Kids aren't the best critics. But these stories still hold a special place in my heart.

This fast paced, generally upbeat, book reads like an adventure movie and is consistently interesting although like most stories along these lines, some of the coincidences are a bit far fetched. Still this is an engaging and entertaining read. While aimed at young adults, there is very little in this book that makes it feel juvenile. It can be read by adults without feeling that they've gotten into kiddie territory. I recommend it.

That was the night that changed everything. The night his father was arrested for drug trafficking, forcing he, his mother and sister into the Witness Protection Program. The night he became Zach Granger. The Grangers live in a tiny town in Nevada's Ruby Mountain, where everyone knows everything about everybody. Zach and his sister "Wanda" have made new friends, and their mother is on her way to opening a bookstore right in the center of town. Things are finally starting to look up. Will Zach's family be safe here in their new haven, or is it just a matter of time before the danger from their past catches up to them? Zach's Lie is a great suspense thriller, perfect for fans of Anthony Horowitz's Alex Rider series; I can't wait to read the sequel, Jack's Run.

Dazed with confusion, the Osborne's are lost and don't know what to do in this non stop thrilling novel. I recommend this book to someone who wants a book they cannot put down.

Finally! Was all I thought as I shut the last page of this book. Despite the interesting plot line and weird twists and turns the story was dry. I expected it all as time started to run out. I could tell that Sam wasn't who he said he was and that that Alonzo was going to find him. The writing was very vague and even thought I usually love to let my imagination flow and take control of the story I felt limited. I will not be reading the sequel to this book even if it is only half as bad!

The author really makes sure he describes what's going on so you can get a visual. Even though he does that, you barely do know what's going on and it's all one big mystery. There are little things that are left out and I love it! When I was reading the book, I was hooked. It was very interesting from the beginning to the end. You know that some of these things could actually be happening in the world right as you are reading it. This book really makes you think.

Not the greatest book. I just found it pretty predictable at times, and the 7th grader who's the main character was not believable at all. He acted more like he was in 4th or 5th grade. What 7th grader plays/talks to an action figure who considers him his pretend friend?

For context, I read this book out loud to several fifth-grade classes over the course of a year, so (unfortunately) I know it pretty intimately. I discussed the book with each class throughout the readings, and most classes picked up on the same issues with the book that I'm about to list now. Zach's Lie is a weak fulfillment of a plot with potential, a plot that could have been engaging and dynamic but fails in large part due to flimsy writing. The book is basically a puppet show where every character is made out of cardboard and moves erratically and nonsensically to the whims of Roland Smith. With the help of an editor and some time spent thinking about the feasibility of his plot, this story could have been told well, but it wasn't. For starters, nearly every main character in this book is stupid and does stupid things, often just to keep the shambling plot moving forward. Jack keeps a journal throughout the whole book of his daily life, including details about their journey through the witness protection program and the events that led up to it. Hmm, I wonder what could happen as a result of this. No clue! /s(view spoiler)[And Patricia somehow thinks it's a great idea to send an old postcard from their new location (didn't even think to drive to Salt Lake City, already mentioned in the book, or literally anywhere else to send it) to their old lawyer, drawing a connection between their new lives and the Osbornes. Also, they don't discuss a backup plan, nor do they utilize their biggest and most well-trained resource, the witness protection agents. And somehow, Alonzo is so omniscient that he can have someone constantly checking the mail of the Osborne's lawyer, "just in case." Sure, OK. This whole scenario feels like Smith had no clue how to drag the drug cartel back into their lives and he wanted to, so he dreamed up this sequence and hoped nobody would actually think about it. And Jack, upon reading his dad's journal with a note that says "don't read this, it's dangerous," takes the journal with him to school. Sure, OK, he's protecting it by keeping it with him -- I can buy that, makes sense. He then immediately blows my mind and opens it as soon as he gets to school and the pages spill out of the dangerous journal so that Peter can steal the one about Alonzo and put himself into "grave" danger. Literally every fifth grader could not fathom why he would do this. Wanna know why Jack opened it? Because Smith needed him to do so to add drama to the story. It's a crutch that he relies on, again and again, and the story suffers for it.  (hide spoiler)]The plot shouldn't develop the actions of the characters; that's why so many of these characters in Zach's Lie feel like cardboard cutouts that only move and speak when asked to. Nobody is more than what they're presented as in the first paragraph of their introduction, with the exception of Sam, the only character with any hint of depth. Alonzo is the big bad that wears all black and runs a drug cartel. Catalin is the pretty, nice girl. Darrell has red hair and likes hunting and video games. Most other characters have so little to them, I can't even remember how to even try to describe them. Various conversations exist only to infodump and are entirely devoid of personality. One passage, around the middle of the book, had Cat telling Jack the backstory of Peter's parents for no conceivable reason except to tell readers about his dad (and ultimately, that information also had no relevance to anything, really). It also happens very obviously in other sections of the story, like when Jack visited the Elko museum early on to find out everything about the Basques. History lesson and "backstory" shoehorned into the book via an addiction to museums that is not mentioned a single time afterwards. Nitpicking now, but multiple times throughout the book, lengthy back-and-forth conversations occur… and Smith does not use dialogue tags. It goes like this:"Hello," says A. "Hi," says B. "It's a nice day out today.""Yes, it is.""I'm glad we went on a walk today.""Did C like the present I got her?" "Yeah, it was really nice. She wanted me to tell you thank you."Who got C the present? Did you have to go back and re-track who said what?It was especially bad because nobody had any semblance of voice, as you'd expect from cardboard characters. I had to back up and tell classes who said which line more than once, which was more than one too many. The occasional bright spots in his ideas (Commander IF as a whole was one that stood out to me, as did the idea of (view spoiler)[Catalin liking Jack's fake blue eyes (hide spoiler)]) were cloaked in the complete lack of character development and nonsensical plot. A solid plot idea and an action-y conclusion doth not a good book make.I would not waste the time of future students by reading Zach's Lie to them.

I thought it was a fantastic book. I liked how the story went with the law and stuff. When Zack and his sister and mother moved to Elko, I thought it was the best because Zack found a really nice custodian and Girl.

The story was an adventure and survival situation for a mother and two children who did nothing criminally wrong but had to pay the price of losing their identity. The colorful descriptive context gives a vivid picture of what was happening and how emotions kept the reader connected to the characters. The only flaw about the book was the ending. I wish the author could have expanded more on the ending and drawn it out a little longer.The story is based on the main character, Jack Osborn, a thirteen year old boy, his older sister Joanne and their mother are forced into the Witness Protection Program. Jack 19s father opened his own small airplane business and for awhile was doing good then he ran into some financial trouble and started smuggling drugs and got caught and was making a deal with the Federal Government to testify against the big-pin drug lords. This hurt the family in many ways especially Jack because he adored his father.The story goes on with the Osborn Family having their names changed and moved to a different location. They have now become Zach, Wanda and Mrs. Granger starting a new life with a lower income status that they weren 19t accustom to. As the story goes on Zach 19s mother and sister seemed to adjust to their new surroundings but Zach was struggling. Making new friends for Zach was hard just as losing his dad and not knowing if he would ever see him again. After a while he did meet Catalin at school and had a crush on her and he also met an older man, Sam Sebesta who was a custodian at his school who seemed to care about him and his family. Sam also introduced Zach to the local Basque sheep herders who lived in the hills and high pastures above the small town they moved to.Many issues came up for Zach and he didn 19t know how to handle them. Throughout the rest of the story there are times of adventure for Zach, he encountered a brawl with a bully at school, he enjoyed eating Basque food at the Inn where Sam lived, and kept writing in his journal to harbor his thoughts just as had seen his father doing from time to time. I felt sad for Zach because I could feel his emotions and what he was going through. This is a good book for teens and adults to read because it shows just how teens and parents can make bad mistakes that cost a family pain and damage for one another.

I enjoyed this book all the questions the book has u ask yourself wile your reading. Something that kind of threw me off is that everyone in (jack's) family names changed threw out the book. The book still kept my interest and i would recommend this book to people who enjoy questing what they read and slowly finding out the answers in the book as they read.

	Do you like action, intense moments and a story that keeps you reading? Well if you do, I have the book for you, Zach’s Lie By Roland Smith. 	I give this book a 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to a friend because I love the action in the book and that there is always something new in every chapter. 	Here is an action moment in the book. “I woke up with a hand clamped over my mouth, a man telling me make one sound and you will die.” That is from the part of the book when the bad guys break into Jack’s house looking for his father. The men start talking to him and ask him where is your father, we need to talk to him. Jack, his sister and mom sit there clueless wondering why these men would need to talk to their husband/father. Then the men tell the mother that the phone will ring, the men will answer it and then the mother will say “they will kill us if you talk.” That is one of first exciting action parts in the book but there are many more.	Mostly every chapter in the book has a different topic. In some parts of the book, things change like a snap of the fingers. First is the day after the men break into their house. The police come swarming in and take almost everything they own to try to use it as evidence against their father. Then in the next chapter, they’re stuck in a hotel and can’t leave for the next 4 days. After that chapter, things heat up with the D.E.A telling them that they have to change their identities and move far away. It takes the mom and sister a few days to feel okay with such a life changing decision but with Jack he doesn’t want to leave. His Mom and sister got to pick their names but the D.E.A. gave Jack the name Zach, which he didn’t like. 	If you want to find out what else happens to the new Granger Family and all the action ahead in the book, I recommend you give this book a try. Trust me when I say that Zach’s Lie will never disappoint you and it definitely won’t be a book that you don’t finish because once you get on board, it is a one- way ticket to the end.

After the first page, I was hooked! I had to find out how and what and why... and who. I felt like a detective looking for clues to piece the puzzle together at first, then on the edge of my seat as a spectator anticipating the worst but hoping for the best. My children heard me cry out in several parts in surprise and dismay as "the bad guys" found the family and made their evil plans.The "lie" referred to in the title is that the family has to be relocated through the "witness security program" and change their identities in order to protect themselves. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and now have more confidence in my son's teacher and her choice of novels for youth because I think this one's a clincher to keep their attention and they may vicariously experience life lessons through it. My favorite character was "Sam," the custodian. He felt real, human, and trustworthy from the get go. Oh, if every young man could have a mentor like him!

First, his name is Jack, not Zach. But he’ll never be able to use “Jack” again. Never. Second, some guys broke into his house and duct-taped his mother, his sister and Jack on the couch. Then they held a phone up to his mom - and told her the only thing she could say to Jack’s father on the other end: they will kill us if you talk. When the police found them, they were happy. When the DEA found them a little later, they were shocked. Jack had no idea what was happening or had happened with his Dad to so completely mess up the family.But that’s the way it was. Jack and his family (except for his Dad who's still in jail talking to the DEA) fly to parts unknown, start new lives with new names, and live a lie. Jack meets other kids at school but has to watch what he says: he's Zach now, and anything he says might put his family in jeopardy - just like his dad did. He must avoid this, but it's not easy to blend in when you're worried that anything you say will blow your cover. What parts of the lies he has to live now will hold up?

Let me tell you why....That was the year that my dad got cancer. Things were really tough in my house. I just took to curling up with a book when I wanted to cry. The land of books is the best for escape, especially action stories. A straightforward tale full of bad guys and excitement is sometimes the best medicine.Now, as a more educated reader, I can say no, it was not the most educational read. What can i say? Kids aren't the best critics. But these stories still hold a special place in my heart.

How does a 7th-grader cope with two identity changes in just a few months without serious adjustment problems? Jack Osborne, alias Zach Granger, alias Mack Greene, manages to pull it off with a maturity that belies his years. On the day that three masked strangers invade the Osborne household and terrorize Jack, his sister Joanne, and their mother, Jack's life is changed forever. His father's involvement in drug smuggling in South America, a situation he later admits was the result of financial problems, has sent his family's life spinning out of control. The father is committed to the Federal Detention Center, and Jack, now Zach Granger, is forced to change his physical appearance, give up his friends, and begin a whole new life under the Federal Witness Protection Program. When Zach meets Sam Sebesta, the enigmatic custodian of his new school, he fears that Sam's interest in him might lead to an unwitting revelation about his past. As events unfold, and the criminals come closer to discovering the Grangers' true identity, Sam's intriguing past enables him to devise a rapid solution that saves the family from certain harm.This book is a great book and if you want to know more then you will have to read the book .

Zach's Lie is a story of a young man (a seventh grader) whose life is uprooted when his father is arrested and his family must enter the witness protection program. He, his mother and his older sister are given new identities and a new life history as well as a new place to live. Such changes are challenging at best but when this happens to a young man at a point in his life when he's struggling to define and discover his real identity, it can be devastating. This fast paced, generally upbeat, book reads like an adventure movie and is consistently interesting although like most stories along these lines, some of the coincidences are a bit far fetched. Still this is an engaging and entertaining read. While aimed at young adults, there is very little in this book that makes it feel juvenile. It can be read by adults without feeling that they've gotten into kiddie territory. I recommend it.

That was the night that changed everything. The night his father was arrested for drug trafficking, forcing he, his mother and sister into the Witness Protection Program. The night he became Zach Granger. The Grangers live in a tiny town in Nevada's Ruby Mountain, where everyone knows everything about everybody. Zach and his sister "Wanda" have made new friends, and their mother is on her way to opening a bookstore right in the center of town. Things are finally starting to look up. Will Zach's family be safe here in their new haven, or is it just a matter of time before the danger from their past catches up to them? Zach's Lie is a great suspense thriller, perfect for fans of Anthony Horowitz's Alex Rider series; I can't wait to read the sequel, Jack's Run.

They then kidnap zacks father and leave the house with no evidence of their visit. It turns out zacks father wasn't flying for an american travel airline, he was the main pilot for an international drug cartel. This is why he was kidnapped. Dazed with confusion, the Osborne's are lost and don't know what to do in this non stop thrilling novel. I recommend this book to someone who wants a book they cannot put down.

        it was ok



Finally! Was all I thought as I shut the last page of this book. Despite the interesting plot line and weird twists and turns the story was dry. I expected it all as time started to run out. I could tell that Sam wasn't who he said he was and that that Alonzo was going to find him. The writing was very vague and even thought I usually love to let my imagination flow and take control of the story I felt limited. I will not be reading the sequel to this book even if it is only half as bad!

The author really makes sure he describes what's going on so you can get a visual. Even though he does that, you barely do know what's going on and it's all one big mystery. There are little things that are left out and I love it! When I was reading the book, I was hooked. It was very interesting from the beginning to the end. You know that some of these things could actually be happening in the world right as you are reading it. This book really makes you think.

Fascinating look into witness protection! A very quick read. Well paced, good character development, highly suspenseful. I will be recommending to my boys in class this year, especially my reluctant readers.

I really liked this book because it showed how a family can be torn down by actions people do and how a boy ended up having a pretty good life at the end. and how sometimes you lie to people he cares about but in the end it all matters. i recommend this book to anyone who likes a mystery books and a really good read.

Not the greatest book. I just found it pretty predictable at times, and the 7th grader who's the main character was not believable at all. He acted more like he was in 4th or 5th grade. What 7th grader plays/talks to an action figure who considers him his pretend friend?

This story was a great story. Its about a boy and his family. Their dad messed up and caused them to get mixed up in his work. So they were about killed and and they had to move out and get new lives and new identity. Read on to see what happens.

This book was awesome. It was a bit slow going in the beginning but then picked up pace. Students were able to quickly predict what might be coming but not enough to figure out what would happen at the end of the novel.

For context, I read this book out loud to several fifth-grade classes over the course of a year, so (unfortunately) I know it pretty intimately. I discussed the book with each class throughout the readings, and most classes picked up on the same issues with the book that I'm about to list now. Zach's Lie is a weak fulfillment of a plot with potential, a plot that could have been engaging and dynamic but fails in large part due to flimsy writing. The book is basically a puppet show where every character is made out of cardboard and moves erratically and nonsensically to the whims of Roland Smith. With the help of an editor and some time spent thinking about the feasibility of his plot, this story could have been told well, but it wasn't. For starters, nearly every main character in this book is stupid and does stupid things, often just to keep the shambling plot moving forward. Jack keeps a journal throughout the whole book of his daily life, including details about their journey through the witness protection program and the events that led up to it. Hmm, I wonder what could happen as a result of this. No clue! /s(view spoiler)[And Patricia somehow thinks it's a great idea to send an old postcard from their new location (didn't even think to drive to Salt Lake City, already mentioned in the book, or literally anywhere else to send it) to their old lawyer, drawing a connection between their new lives and the Osbornes. Also, they don't discuss a backup plan, nor do they utilize their biggest and most well-trained resource, the witness protection agents. And somehow, Alonzo is so omniscient that he can have someone constantly checking the mail of the Osborne's lawyer, "just in case." Sure, OK. This whole scenario feels like Smith had no clue how to drag the drug cartel back into their lives and he wanted to, so he dreamed up this sequence and hoped nobody would actually think about it. And Jack, upon reading his dad's journal with a note that says "don't read this, it's dangerous," takes the journal with him to school. Sure, OK, he's protecting it by keeping it with him -- I can buy that, makes sense. He then immediately blows my mind and opens it as soon as he gets to school and the pages spill out of the dangerous journal so that Peter can steal the one about Alonzo and put himself into "grave" danger. Literally every fifth grader could not fathom why he would do this. Wanna know why Jack opened it? Because Smith needed him to do so to add drama to the story. It's a crutch that he relies on, again and again, and the story suffers for it.  (hide spoiler)]The plot shouldn't develop the actions of the characters; that's why so many of these characters in Zach's Lie feel like cardboard cutouts that only move and speak when asked to. Nobody is more than what they're presented as in the first paragraph of their introduction, with the exception of Sam, the only character with any hint of depth. Alonzo is the big bad that wears all black and runs a drug cartel. Catalin is the pretty, nice girl. Darrell has red hair and likes hunting and video games. Most other characters have so little to them, I can't even remember how to even try to describe them. Various conversations exist only to infodump and are entirely devoid of personality. One passage, around the middle of the book, had Cat telling Jack the backstory of Peter's parents for no conceivable reason except to tell readers about his dad (and ultimately, that information also had no relevance to anything, really). It also happens very obviously in other sections of the story, like when Jack visited the Elko museum early on to find out everything about the Basques. History lesson and "backstory" shoehorned into the book via an addiction to museums that is not mentioned a single time afterwards. Nitpicking now, but multiple times throughout the book, lengthy back-and-forth conversations occur… and Smith does not use dialogue tags. It goes like this:"Hello," says A. "Hi," says B. "It's a nice day out today.""Yes, it is.""I'm glad we went on a walk today.""Did C like the present I got her?" "Yeah, it was really nice. She wanted me to tell you thank you."Who got C the present? Did you have to go back and re-track who said what?It was especially bad because nobody had any semblance of voice, as you'd expect from cardboard characters. I had to back up and tell classes who said which line more than once, which was more than one too many. The occasional bright spots in his ideas (Commander IF as a whole was one that stood out to me, as did the idea of (view spoiler)[Catalin liking Jack's fake blue eyes (hide spoiler)]) were cloaked in the complete lack of character development and nonsensical plot. A solid plot idea and an action-y conclusion doth not a good book make.I would not waste the time of future students by reading Zach's Lie to them.

I thought it was a fantastic book. I liked how the story went with the law and stuff. When Zack and his sister and mother moved to Elko, I thought it was the best because Zack found a really nice custodian and Girl. I loved there new lives but when the drug cartels found them again it was sad. Just the whole book is amazing and I would read it again and again and again.

Review: Zach 19s Lie by Roland Smith.This book shows how drugs can really mess up your life and it also explains all the different ways to change your identity. The story was an adventure and survival situation for a mother and two children who did nothing criminally wrong but had to pay the price of losing their identity. The colorful descriptive context gives a vivid picture of what was happening and how emotions kept the reader connected to the characters. The only flaw about the book was the ending. I wish the author could have expanded more on the ending and drawn it out a little longer.The story is based on the main character, Jack Osborn, a thirteen year old boy, his older sister Joanne and their mother are forced into the Witness Protection Program. Jack 19s father opened his own small airplane business and for awhile was doing good then he ran into some financial trouble and started smuggling drugs and got caught and was making a deal with the Federal Government to testify against the big-pin drug lords. This hurt the family in many ways especially Jack because he adored his father.The story goes on with the Osborn Family having their names changed and moved to a different location. They have now become Zach, Wanda and Mrs. Granger starting a new life with a lower income status that they weren 19t accustom to. As the story goes on Zach 19s mother and sister seemed to adjust to their new surroundings but Zach was struggling. Making new friends for Zach was hard just as losing his dad and not knowing if he would ever see him again. After a while he did meet Catalin at school and had a crush on her and he also met an older man, Sam Sebesta who was a custodian at his school who seemed to care about him and his family. Sam also introduced Zach to the local Basque sheep herders who lived in the hills and high pastures above the small town they moved to.Many issues came up for Zach and he didn 19t know how to handle them. Throughout the rest of the story there are times of adventure for Zach, he encountered a brawl with a bully at school, he enjoyed eating Basque food at the Inn where Sam lived, and kept writing in his journal to harbor his thoughts just as had seen his father doing from time to time. I felt sad for Zach because I could feel his emotions and what he was going through. This is a good book for teens and adults to read because it shows just how teens and parents can make bad mistakes that cost a family pain and damage for one another.

I enjoyed this book all the questions the book has u ask yourself wile your reading. Something that kind of threw me off is that everyone in (jack's) family names changed threw out the book. The book still kept my interest and i would recommend this book to people who enjoy questing what they read and slowly finding out the answers in the book as they read.

	Do you like action, intense moments and a story that keeps you reading? Well if you do, I have the book for you, Zach’s Lie By Roland Smith. 	I give this book a 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to a friend because I love the action in the book and that there is always something new in every chapter. 	Here is an action moment in the book. “I woke up with a hand clamped over my mouth, a man telling me make one sound and you will die.” That is from the part of the book when the bad guys break into Jack’s house looking for his father. The men start talking to him and ask him where is your father, we need to talk to him. Jack, his sister and mom sit there clueless wondering why these men would need to talk to their husband/father. Then the men tell the mother that the phone will ring, the men will answer it and then the mother will say “they will kill us if you talk.” That is one of first exciting action parts in the book but there are many more.	Mostly every chapter in the book has a different topic. In some parts of the book, things change like a snap of the fingers. First is the day after the men break into their house. The police come swarming in and take almost everything they own to try to use it as evidence against their father. Then in the next chapter, they’re stuck in a hotel and can’t leave for the next 4 days. After that chapter, things heat up with the D.E.A telling them that they have to change their identities and move far away. It takes the mom and sister a few days to feel okay with such a life changing decision but with Jack he doesn’t want to leave. His Mom and sister got to pick their names but the D.E.A. gave Jack the name Zach, which he didn’t like. 	If you want to find out what else happens to the new Granger Family and all the action ahead in the book, I recommend you give this book a try. Trust me when I say that Zach’s Lie will never disappoint you and it definitely won’t be a book that you don’t finish because once you get on board, it is a one- way ticket to the end.

Editorial Reviews


KLIATT
How does a 7th-grader cope with two identity changes in just a few months without serious adjustment problems? Jack Osborne, alias Zach Granger, alias Mack Greene, manages to pull it off with a maturity that belies his years. On the day that three masked strangers invade the Osborne household and terrorize Jack, his sister Joanne, and their mother, Jack's life is changed forever. His father's involvement in drug smuggling in South America, a situation he later admits was the result of financial problems, has sent his family's life spinning out of control. The father is committed to the Federal Detention Center, and Jack, now Zach Granger, is forced to change his physical appearance, give up his friends, and begin a whole new life under the Federal Witness Protection Program. When Zach meets Sam Sebesta, the enigmatic custodian of his new school, he fears that Sam's interest in him might lead to an unwitting revelation about his past. As events unfold, and the criminals come closer to discovering the Grangers' true identity, Sam's intriguing past enables him to devise a rapid solution that saves the family from certain harm. A jealous schoolmate's theft of Zach's journal ultimately leads the drug criminals to the Grangers' new home. However, Sam rescues a single journal entry written by Zach's father, a discovery that becomes critical in the capture of the smuggling cartel. The timing of both incidents gives this novel a good measure of suspense, and the reader will be caught up in a vicarious fear for the family's safety. Because the criminal network is so vast, the Osborne family is forced to begin anew in yet another location. Zach, now Mack Greene, especially regrets leaving Catalin,the girl who has been his romantic interest, but this sacrifice pales in significance when his father is released from prison and rejoins the family for good. This high-interest novel has enough teen issues to satisfy even the most reluctant readers. The themes of trust and betrayal, family loyalty, loss, friendship and first romance will make it highly interesting to YAs.  KLIATT Codes: JRecommended for junior high school students. 2001, Hyperion, 211p.,  Ages 12 to 15. Phyllis Lamontagne


VOYA
  Jack Osborne is oblivious to his father's secret life. On the surface, Neil Osborne appears to be a commercial airline pilot who owns his own plane and cargo business. One of his major clients, however, is a South American drug lord who uses the plane service to ship his drugs into the United States. Jack discovers all of this when his father suddenly is arrested and his family is placed in the witness security program. Jack becomes Zach Granger when he and his mother and sister are forced to move to an obscure Nevada town. Coming to terms with his manufactured identity, which includes colored contacts and a new middle school, is harder for Zach than for the rest of his family. The only thing that gives him peace is writing in his private journal. When that journal falls into the wrong hands, Zach has to figure out what to hide and who to trust, knowing that the wrong decision could cost his family members their lives. Although the plot unquestionably is riveting, Smith's third-person voice is a bit wooden and there are a few too many coincidences to make this story completely ring true. For example, Zach's new friend, the school custodian, is also a retired KGB spy, and the bad guys stalking Zach just happen to question the one kid at school who has it in for him. Having said that, booktalk this title to reluctant readers and watch them devour it in one sitting. VOYA CODES: 3Q 4P M J (Readable without serious defects; Broad general YA appeal; Middle School, defined as grades 6 to 8; Junior High, defined as grades 7 to 9). 2001, Hyperion/Disney, 240p, . Ages 12 to 15. Reviewer: Jennifer Hubert SOURCE: VOYA, June 2001 (Vol. 24, No. 2)


Children's Literature
  Imagine leaving all your friends and possessions and starting life with a new identity. Jack Osbourne becomes Zach Granger when he, his mother and sister are relocated to Elko, Nevada, a small town in the middle of nowhere. Zach's dad has been arrested for drug trafficking and their lives have been threatened by evil men who mean business. If the family is safely ensconced in the witness protection program, the father agrees to turn states evidence. Just as Zach, his mother and sister become comfortable with the new situation, things begin to unravel. In order to adjust to his new identity and the lies that go with it, Zach writes about his past life in a journal. But someone steals it, leaving the entire family in peril. Many trials and tribulations of moving, making friends and adjusting to new surroundings have been addressed in this adventure, which will keep young readers enthralled. Interesting characters and a roller coaster ride to the finish make this a believable and entertaining story. 2001, Hyperion, . Ages 10 to 14. Reviewer: Laura Hummel


School Library Journal
Gr 5-9-In this contemporary suspense novel, Jack's father, a  pilot, has been arrested for drug trafficking. When the cartel  thugs come to their house to terrorize the teen, his mother, and  his sister, they become candidates for the Witness Security  Program and must change their identities. Although the family is  told not to bring anything to Nevada that would link them to  their former lives, Jack, now Zach, cannot leave his diary  behind. With the villains searching for them, there can be no  slipups, but the young protagonist soon learns that, in the  small town of Elko, "Everyone knows Everything about Everybody."  The diary and Zach's vulnerability are well-developed devices,  but the plot soon becomes compromised by some unbelievable  twists and turns. Zach is befriended by the school custodian,  Sam, who acts as the principal's assistant, handling  disciplinary cases with counseling and boxing therapy. Sam  introduces Zach to the Basque people, sheep tenders in the hills  outside town, who conveniently provide a hiding place for Zach  when the bad guys arrive. In the biggest stretch of all, Sam  outwits the thugs with talents he acquired as a KGB agent. Other  details and characters merely set up the chain of events, which  is unfortunate because individual chapters are often exciting,  and there is a great potential to satisfy suspense fans.-Vicki  Reutter, Cazenovia High School, NY   Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.


Kirkus Reviews
  The life Jack Osborne knew has just ended. One night the seventh-grader wakes up to find masked men ransacking his house; the next thing he knows, his father has been arrested for drug trafficking. When the accusations against his dad prove true, Jack, his sister Joanne, and his mother enter the FBI's witness protection program. They must leave everything behind and relocate to a small town in Nevada under an assumed identity. Each member of the family deals with this monumental upheaval in a different way. Jack's mother maintains calm composure, while 16-year-old Joanne sees the experience as an opportunity to hone her acting skills. Only Jack, who becomes Zach in his new life, has difficulty adjusting. The contrast between his wealthy former life and the tiny town they are hiding in is stark. He misses his friends, his school, and, above all, his father. Along with this story line, the author includes two interesting subplots. One involves the drug cartel his father was involved in: they have found the family and are preparing to have them killed to prevent Neil's testimony. A second, more richly drawn layer is the inclusion of a large community of Basque people who live nearby in the mountains, continuing their old-fashioned life as shepherds. Jack/Zach makes connections with them and they play a large part in the conclusion of the novel. An explosive but believable ending leaves a few loose ends, but feels satisfying. Jack/Zach is a complex character, struggling with all kinds of emotions about his new life circumstances while also trying to be a normal teenager. An intriguing idea, well-written, with many heart-stopping moments, this should appeal to a wide variety of readers.(Fiction. 12-14)

I felt like a detective looking for clues to piece the puzzle together at first, then on the edge of my seat as a spectator anticipating the worst but hoping for the best. My children heard me cry out in several parts in surprise and dismay as "the bad guys" found the family and made their evil plans.The "lie" referred to in the title is that the family has to be relocated through the "witness security program" and change their identities in order to protect themselves. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and now have more confidence in my son's teacher and her choice of novels for youth because I think this one's a clincher to keep their attention and they may vicariously experience life lessons through it. My favorite character was "Sam," the custodian. He felt real, human, and trustworthy from the get go. Oh, if every young man could have a mentor like him!

Have you ever felt like you were living a lie? Like, right before breaking up with a girlfriend or boyfriend you pretend you still like them? Well, Zach’s lie is a bit bigger than that. First, his name is Jack, not Zach. But he’ll never be able to use “Jack” again. Never. Second, some guys broke into his house and duct-taped his mother, his sister and Jack on the couch.

First, his name is Jack, not Zach. But he’ll never be able to use “Jack” again. Never. Second, some guys broke into his house and duct-taped his mother, his sister and Jack on the couch. Then they held a phone up to his mom - and told her the only thing she could say to Jack’s father on the other end: they will kill us if you talk. When the police found them, they were happy. When the DEA found them a little later, they were shocked. Jack had no idea what was happening or had happened with his Dad to so completely mess up the family.But that’s the way it was. Jack and his family (except for his Dad who's still in jail talking to the DEA) fly to parts unknown, start new lives with new names, and live a lie. Jack meets other kids at school but has to watch what he says: he's Zach now, and anything he says might put his family in jeopardy - just like his dad did. He must avoid this, but it's not easy to blend in when you're worried that anything you say will blow your cover. What parts of the lies he has to live now will hold up?

The land of books is the best for escape, especially action stories. A straightforward tale full of bad guys and excitement is sometimes the best medicine.Now, as a more educated reader, I can say no, it was not the most educational read. What can i say? Kids aren't the best critics. But these stories still hold a special place in my heart.

This fast paced, generally upbeat, book reads like an adventure movie and is consistently interesting although like most stories along these lines, some of the coincidences are a bit far fetched. Still this is an engaging and entertaining read. While aimed at young adults, there is very little in this book that makes it feel juvenile. It can be read by adults without feeling that they've gotten into kiddie territory. I recommend it.

That was the night that changed everything. The night his father was arrested for drug trafficking, forcing he, his mother and sister into the Witness Protection Program. The night he became Zach Granger. The Grangers live in a tiny town in Nevada's Ruby Mountain, where everyone knows everything about everybody. Zach and his sister "Wanda" have made new friends, and their mother is on her way to opening a bookstore right in the center of town. Things are finally starting to look up. Will Zach's family be safe here in their new haven, or is it just a matter of time before the danger from their past catches up to them? Zach's Lie is a great suspense thriller, perfect for fans of Anthony Horowitz's Alex Rider series; I can't wait to read the sequel, Jack's Run.

It turns out zacks father wasn't flying for an american travel airline, he was the main pilot for an international drug cartel. This is why he was kidnapped. Dazed with confusion, the Osborne's are lost and don't know what to do in this non stop thrilling novel. I recommend this book to someone who wants a book they cannot put down.

Finally! Was all I thought as I shut the last page of this book. Despite the interesting plot line and weird twists and turns the story was dry. I expected it all as time started to run out. I could tell that Sam wasn't who he said he was and that that Alonzo was going to find him. The writing was very vague and even thought I usually love to let my imagination flow and take control of the story I felt limited. I will not be reading the sequel to this book even if it is only half as bad!

The author really makes sure he describes what's going on so you can get a visual. Even though he does that, you barely do know what's going on and it's all one big mystery. There are little things that are left out and I love it! When I was reading the book, I was hooked. It was very interesting from the beginning to the end. You know that some of these things could actually be happening in the world right as you are reading it. This book really makes you think.

Not the greatest book. I just found it pretty predictable at times, and the 7th grader who's the main character was not believable at all. He acted more like he was in 4th or 5th grade. What 7th grader plays/talks to an action figure who considers him his pretend friend?

For context, I read this book out loud to several fifth-grade classes over the course of a year, so (unfortunately) I know it pretty intimately. I discussed the book with each class throughout the readings, and most classes picked up on the same issues with the book that I'm about to list now. Zach's Lie is a weak fulfillment of a plot with potential, a plot that could have been engaging and dynamic but fails in large part due to flimsy writing. The book is basically a puppet show where every character is made out of cardboard and moves erratically and nonsensically to the whims of Roland Smith. With the help of an editor and some time spent thinking about the feasibility of his plot, this story could have been told well, but it wasn't. For starters, nearly every main character in this book is stupid and does stupid things, often just to keep the shambling plot moving forward. Jack keeps a journal throughout the whole book of his daily life, including details about their journey through the witness protection program and the events that led up to it. Hmm, I wonder what could happen as a result of this. No clue! /s(view spoiler)[And Patricia somehow thinks it's a great idea to send an old postcard from their new location (didn't even think to drive to Salt Lake City, already mentioned in the book, or literally anywhere else to send it) to their old lawyer, drawing a connection between their new lives and the Osbornes. Also, they don't discuss a backup plan, nor do they utilize their biggest and most well-trained resource, the witness protection agents. And somehow, Alonzo is so omniscient that he can have someone constantly checking the mail of the Osborne's lawyer, "just in case." Sure, OK. This whole scenario feels like Smith had no clue how to drag the drug cartel back into their lives and he wanted to, so he dreamed up this sequence and hoped nobody would actually think about it. And Jack, upon reading his dad's journal with a note that says "don't read this, it's dangerous," takes the journal with him to school. Sure, OK, he's protecting it by keeping it with him -- I can buy that, makes sense. He then immediately blows my mind and opens it as soon as he gets to school and the pages spill out of the dangerous journal so that Peter can steal the one about Alonzo and put himself into "grave" danger. Literally every fifth grader could not fathom why he would do this. Wanna know why Jack opened it? Because Smith needed him to do so to add drama to the story. It's a crutch that he relies on, again and again, and the story suffers for it.  (hide spoiler)]The plot shouldn't develop the actions of the characters; that's why so many of these characters in Zach's Lie feel like cardboard cutouts that only move and speak when asked to. Nobody is more than what they're presented as in the first paragraph of their introduction, with the exception of Sam, the only character with any hint of depth. Alonzo is the big bad that wears all black and runs a drug cartel. Catalin is the pretty, nice girl. Darrell has red hair and likes hunting and video games. Most other characters have so little to them, I can't even remember how to even try to describe them. Various conversations exist only to infodump and are entirely devoid of personality. One passage, around the middle of the book, had Cat telling Jack the backstory of Peter's parents for no conceivable reason except to tell readers about his dad (and ultimately, that information also had no relevance to anything, really). It also happens very obviously in other sections of the story, like when Jack visited the Elko museum early on to find out everything about the Basques. History lesson and "backstory" shoehorned into the book via an addiction to museums that is not mentioned a single time afterwards. Nitpicking now, but multiple times throughout the book, lengthy back-and-forth conversations occur… and Smith does not use dialogue tags. It goes like this:"Hello," says A. "Hi," says B. "It's a nice day out today.""Yes, it is.""I'm glad we went on a walk today.""Did C like the present I got her?" "Yeah, it was really nice. She wanted me to tell you thank you."Who got C the present? Did you have to go back and re-track who said what?It was especially bad because nobody had any semblance of voice, as you'd expect from cardboard characters. I had to back up and tell classes who said which line more than once, which was more than one too many. The occasional bright spots in his ideas (Commander IF as a whole was one that stood out to me, as did the idea of (view spoiler)[Catalin liking Jack's fake blue eyes (hide spoiler)]) were cloaked in the complete lack of character development and nonsensical plot. A solid plot idea and an action-y conclusion doth not a good book make.I would not waste the time of future students by reading Zach's Lie to them.

I thought it was a fantastic book. I liked how the story went with the law and stuff. When Zack and his sister and mother moved to Elko, I thought it was the best because Zack found a really nice custodian and Girl. I loved there new lives but when the drug cartels found them again it was sad. Just the whole book is amazing and I would read it again and again and again.

The colorful descriptive context gives a vivid picture of what was happening and how emotions kept the reader connected to the characters. The only flaw about the book was the ending. I wish the author could have expanded more on the ending and drawn it out a little longer.The story is based on the main character, Jack Osborn, a thirteen year old boy, his older sister Joanne and their mother are forced into the Witness Protection Program. Jack 19s father opened his own small airplane business and for awhile was doing good then he ran into some financial trouble and started smuggling drugs and got caught and was making a deal with the Federal Government to testify against the big-pin drug lords. This hurt the family in many ways especially Jack because he adored his father.The story goes on with the Osborn Family having their names changed and moved to a different location. They have now become Zach, Wanda and Mrs. Granger starting a new life with a lower income status that they weren 19t accustom to. As the story goes on Zach 19s mother and sister seemed to adjust to their new surroundings but Zach was struggling. Making new friends for Zach was hard just as losing his dad and not knowing if he would ever see him again. After a while he did meet Catalin at school and had a crush on her and he also met an older man, Sam Sebesta who was a custodian at his school who seemed to care about him and his family. Sam also introduced Zach to the local Basque sheep herders who lived in the hills and high pastures above the small town they moved to.Many issues came up for Zach and he didn 19t know how to handle them. Throughout the rest of the story there are times of adventure for Zach, he encountered a brawl with a bully at school, he enjoyed eating Basque food at the Inn where Sam lived, and kept writing in his journal to harbor his thoughts just as had seen his father doing from time to time. I felt sad for Zach because I could feel his emotions and what he was going through. This is a good book for teens and adults to read because it shows just how teens and parents can make bad mistakes that cost a family pain and damage for one another.

I enjoyed this book all the questions the book has u ask yourself wile your reading. Something that kind of threw me off is that everyone in (jack's) family names changed threw out the book. The book still kept my interest and i would recommend this book to people who enjoy questing what they read and slowly finding out the answers in the book as they read.

	Do you like action, intense moments and a story that keeps you reading? Well if you do, I have the book for you, Zach’s Lie By Roland Smith. 	I give this book a 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to a friend because I love the action in the book and that there is always something new in every chapter. 	Here is an action moment in the book. “I woke up with a hand clamped over my mouth, a man telling me make one sound and you will die.” That is from the part of the book when the bad guys break into Jack’s house looking for his father. The men start talking to him and ask him where is your father, we need to talk to him. Jack, his sister and mom sit there clueless wondering why these men would need to talk to their husband/father. Then the men tell the mother that the phone will ring, the men will answer it and then the mother will say “they will kill us if you talk.” That is one of first exciting action parts in the book but there are many more.	Mostly every chapter in the book has a different topic. In some parts of the book, things change like a snap of the fingers. First is the day after the men break into their house. The police come swarming in and take almost everything they own to try to use it as evidence against their father. Then in the next chapter, they’re stuck in a hotel and can’t leave for the next 4 days. After that chapter, things heat up with the D.E.A telling them that they have to change their identities and move far away. It takes the mom and sister a few days to feel okay with such a life changing decision but with Jack he doesn’t want to leave. His Mom and sister got to pick their names but the D.E.A. gave Jack the name Zach, which he didn’t like. 	If you want to find out what else happens to the new Granger Family and all the action ahead in the book, I recommend you give this book a try. Trust me when I say that Zach’s Lie will never disappoint you and it definitely won’t be a book that you don’t finish because once you get on board, it is a one- way ticket to the end.

Editorial Reviews


KLIATT
How does a 7th-grader cope with two identity changes in just a few months without serious adjustment problems? Jack Osborne, alias Zach Granger, alias Mack Greene, manages to pull it off with a maturity that belies his years. On the day that three masked strangers invade the Osborne household and terrorize Jack, his sister Joanne, and their mother, Jack's life is changed forever. His father's involvement in drug smuggling in South America, a situation he later admits was the result of financial problems, has sent his family's life spinning out of control. The father is committed to the Federal Detention Center, and Jack, now Zach Granger, is forced to change his physical appearance, give up his friends, and begin a whole new life under the Federal Witness Protection Program. When Zach meets Sam Sebesta, the enigmatic custodian of his new school, he fears that Sam's interest in him might lead to an unwitting revelation about his past. As events unfold, and the criminals come closer to discovering the Grangers' true identity, Sam's intriguing past enables him to devise a rapid solution that saves the family from certain harm. A jealous schoolmate's theft of Zach's journal ultimately leads the drug criminals to the Grangers' new home. However, Sam rescues a single journal entry written by Zach's father, a discovery that becomes critical in the capture of the smuggling cartel. The timing of both incidents gives this novel a good measure of suspense, and the reader will be caught up in a vicarious fear for the family's safety. Because the criminal network is so vast, the Osborne family is forced to begin anew in yet another location. Zach, now Mack Greene, especially regrets leaving Catalin,the girl who has been his romantic interest, but this sacrifice pales in significance when his father is released from prison and rejoins the family for good. This high-interest novel has enough teen issues to satisfy even the most reluctant readers. The themes of trust and betrayal, family loyalty, loss, friendship and first romance will make it highly interesting to YAs.  KLIATT Codes: JRecommended for junior high school students. 2001, Hyperion, 211p.,  Ages 12 to 15. Phyllis Lamontagne


VOYA
  Jack Osborne is oblivious to his father's secret life. On the surface, Neil Osborne appears to be a commercial airline pilot who owns his own plane and cargo business. One of his major clients, however, is a South American drug lord who uses the plane service to ship his drugs into the United States. Jack discovers all of this when his father suddenly is arrested and his family is placed in the witness security program. Jack becomes Zach Granger when he and his mother and sister are forced to move to an obscure Nevada town. Coming to terms with his manufactured identity, which includes colored contacts and a new middle school, is harder for Zach than for the rest of his family. The only thing that gives him peace is writing in his private journal. When that journal falls into the wrong hands, Zach has to figure out what to hide and who to trust, knowing that the wrong decision could cost his family members their lives. Although the plot unquestionably is riveting, Smith's third-person voice is a bit wooden and there are a few too many coincidences to make this story completely ring true. For example, Zach's new friend, the school custodian, is also a retired KGB spy, and the bad guys stalking Zach just happen to question the one kid at school who has it in for him. Having said that, booktalk this title to reluctant readers and watch them devour it in one sitting. VOYA CODES: 3Q 4P M J (Readable without serious defects; Broad general YA appeal; Middle School, defined as grades 6 to 8; Junior High, defined as grades 7 to 9). 2001, Hyperion/Disney, 240p, . Ages 12 to 15. Reviewer: Jennifer Hubert SOURCE: VOYA, June 2001 (Vol. 24, No. 2)


Children's Literature
  Imagine leaving all your friends and possessions and starting life with a new identity. Jack Osbourne becomes Zach Granger when he, his mother and sister are relocated to Elko, Nevada, a small town in the middle of nowhere. Zach's dad has been arrested for drug trafficking and their lives have been threatened by evil men who mean business. If the family is safely ensconced in the witness protection program, the father agrees to turn states evidence. Just as Zach, his mother and sister become comfortable with the new situation, things begin to unravel. In order to adjust to his new identity and the lies that go with it, Zach writes about his past life in a journal. But someone steals it, leaving the entire family in peril. Many trials and tribulations of moving, making friends and adjusting to new surroundings have been addressed in this adventure, which will keep young readers enthralled. Interesting characters and a roller coaster ride to the finish make this a believable and entertaining story. 2001, Hyperion, . Ages 10 to 14. Reviewer: Laura Hummel


School Library Journal
Gr 5-9-In this contemporary suspense novel, Jack's father, a  pilot, has been arrested for drug trafficking. When the cartel  thugs come to their house to terrorize the teen, his mother, and  his sister, they become candidates for the Witness Security  Program and must change their identities. Although the family is  told not to bring anything to Nevada that would link them to  their former lives, Jack, now Zach, cannot leave his diary  behind. With the villains searching for them, there can be no  slipups, but the young protagonist soon learns that, in the  small town of Elko, "Everyone knows Everything about Everybody."  The diary and Zach's vulnerability are well-developed devices,  but the plot soon becomes compromised by some unbelievable  twists and turns. Zach is befriended by the school custodian,  Sam, who acts as the principal's assistant, handling  disciplinary cases with counseling and boxing therapy. Sam  introduces Zach to the Basque people, sheep tenders in the hills  outside town, who conveniently provide a hiding place for Zach  when the bad guys arrive. In the biggest stretch of all, Sam  outwits the thugs with talents he acquired as a KGB agent. Other  details and characters merely set up the chain of events, which  is unfortunate because individual chapters are often exciting,  and there is a great potential to satisfy suspense fans.-Vicki  Reutter, Cazenovia High School, NY   Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.


Kirkus Reviews
  The life Jack Osborne knew has just ended. One night the seventh-grader wakes up to find masked men ransacking his house; the next thing he knows, his father has been arrested for drug trafficking. When the accusations against his dad prove true, Jack, his sister Joanne, and his mother enter the FBI's witness protection program. They must leave everything behind and relocate to a small town in Nevada under an assumed identity. Each member of the family deals with this monumental upheaval in a different way. Jack's mother maintains calm composure, while 16-year-old Joanne sees the experience as an opportunity to hone her acting skills. Only Jack, who becomes Zach in his new life, has difficulty adjusting. The contrast between his wealthy former life and the tiny town they are hiding in is stark. He misses his friends, his school, and, above all, his father. Along with this story line, the author includes two interesting subplots. One involves the drug cartel his father was involved in: they have found the family and are preparing to have them killed to prevent Neil's testimony. A second, more richly drawn layer is the inclusion of a large community of Basque people who live nearby in the mountains, continuing their old-fashioned life as shepherds. Jack/Zach makes connections with them and they play a large part in the conclusion of the novel. An explosive but believable ending leaves a few loose ends, but feels satisfying. Jack/Zach is a complex character, struggling with all kinds of emotions about his new life circumstances while also trying to be a normal teenager. An intriguing idea, well-written, with many heart-stopping moments, this should appeal to a wide variety of readers.(Fiction. 12-14)

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
