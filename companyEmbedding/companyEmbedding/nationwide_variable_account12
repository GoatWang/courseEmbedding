Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.
An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement. It will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments. An annuity isn’t intended to replace emergency funds or to fund short-term savings goal.
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal.
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, and it’s sold by prospectus. You should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees and the expense of the underlying investment options.
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to specific questions.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Annuities issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio. 

Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying funds contain this and other important information.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

2.   The "Legal Proceedings" provision of your prospectus is amended as follows:

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Nationwide is a party to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary 
course of its business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse    
effect on Nationwide.                                                           

In recent years, life insurance companies have been named as defendants in      
lawsuits, including class action lawsuits relating to life insurance and annuity
pricing and sales practices. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in        
substantial jury awards or settlements.                                         

On October 29, 1998, Nationwide was named in a lawsuit filed in Ohio state court
related to the sale of deferred annuity products for use as investments in      
tax-deferred contributory retirement plans (Mercedes Castillo v. Nationwide     
Financial Services, Inc., Nationwide Life Insurance Company and Nationwide Life 
and Annuity Insurance Company). On May 3, 1999, the complaint was amended to,   
among other things, add Marcus Shore as a second plaintiff. The amended         
complaint is brought as a class action on behalf of all persons who purchased   
individual deferred annuity contracts or participated in group annuity contracts
sold by Nationwide and the other named Nationwide affiliates, which were used to
fund certain tax-deferred retirement plans. The amended complaint seeks         
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. On June 11, 1999, Nationwide and 
the other named defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On  
March 8, 2000, the Court denied the motion to dismiss the amended complaint     
filed by Nationwide and the other named defendants. On January 25, 2002, the    
plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint to add three new   
named plaintiffs. On February 9, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class  
certification. On April 16, 2002, Nationwide filed a motion for summary judgment
on the individual claims of plaintiff Mercedes Castillo. On May 28, 2002, the   
Court granted the motion of Marcus Shore to withdraw as a named plaintiff and   
denied plaintiffs' motion to add new persons as named plaintiffs, so the action 
is now proceeding with Mercedes Castillo as the only named plaintiff. On        
November 4, 2002, the Court issued a decision granting Nationwide's motion for  
summary judgment on all of plaintiff Mercedes Castillo's individual claims, and 
ruling that plaintiff's motion for class certification is moot. Judgment for    
Nationwide was entered on November 15, 2002. On December 16, 2002, plaintiff    
Mercedes Castillo filed a notice of appeal from the Court's orders (a) granting 
Nationwide's motion for summary judgment; and (b) denying Castillo's motion for 
leave to amend the complaint to add three new named plaintiffs. Nationwide's    
responsive brief is due by April 23, 2003 and plaintiff's reply brief is due by 
May 12, 2003. The appeal was argued on July 1, 2003. Nationwide intends to      
defend this lawsuit vigorously.                                                 

On August 15, 2001, Nationwide was named in a lawsuit filed in Connecticut      
federal court titled Lou Haddock, as trustee of the Flyte Tool & Die,           
Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, et al v. Nationwide Financial Services,
Inc. and Nationwide Life Insurance Company. On September 6, 2001, the plaintiffs
amended their complaint to include class action allegations. The plaintiffs seek
to represent a class of retirement plans that purchased variable annuities from 
Nationwide to fund qualified ERISA retirement plans. The amended complaint      
alleges that the retirement plans purchased variable annuity contracts from     
Nationwide that allowed plan participants to invest in funds that were offered  
by separate mutual fund companies; that Nationwide was a fiduciary under ERISA  
and that Nationwide breached its fiduciary duty when it accepted certain fees   
from the mutual fund companies that purportedly were never disclosed by         
Nationwide; and that Nationwide violated ERISA by replacing many of the funds   
originally included in the plaintiffs' annuities with "inferior" funds because  
the new funds purportedly paid higher fees to Nationwide. The amended complaint 
seeks disgorgement of the fees allegedly received by Nationwide and other       
unspecified compensatory damages, declaratory and injunctive relief and         
attorney's fees. On December 3, 2001, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class   
certification. Nationwide is opposing that motion. Nationwide's Motion to       
Dismiss was denied on September 11, 2002. On January 14, 2003, plaintiffs filed 
a motion to file a second amended complaint and the motion was granted on       
February 21, 2003. The second amended complaint removes the claims asserted     
against Nationwide concerning a violation of ERISA through the replacement of   
many of the funds originally included in the plaintiffs' annuities with         
"inferior" funds that purportedly paid higher fees to Nationwide. On April 14,
2003, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint,    
which was granted. The third amended complaint does not include claims against  
Nationwide explicitly alleging a violation of ERISA through misrepresentation,  
breach of contract, or the replacement of funds with "inferior" funds that      
purportedly paid higher fees to Nationwide. Nationwide intends to defend this   
lawsuit vigorously.                                                             

On May 1, 2003, a class action was filed against Nationwide in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, entitled Edward Miller,   
Individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Nationwide Life
Insurance Company. The Complaint alleges that in November 2001, plaintiff Edward
Miller purchased a group modified single premium variable annuity issued by     
Nationwide. Plaintiff alleges that contract holders could transfer assets       
without charge among the various funds offered in the contracts, that the       
transfer rights of contract holders could not be modified and that Nationwide's 
expense charges under the contracts were fixed. Plaintiff claims that Nationwide
breached the contracts and violated federal securities laws by imposing trading 
fees on transfers that were supposed to have been without charge. Plaintiff     
seeks compensatory damages and rescission on behalf of himself and a class of   
persons who purchased this type of annuity or similar products issued by        
Nationwide between May 1, 2001 and April 30, 2002 inclusive and were allegedly  
damaged by paying transfer fees. Nationwide's motion to dismiss the complaint   
was granted by the Court on October 28, 2003.                                   

There can be no assurance that any such litigation will not have a material     
adverse effect on Nationwide in the future.                                     

Waddell & Reed, Inc. is a party to legal proceedings incident to its normal     
business operations. While there can be no assurances, none of the currently    
pending legal proceedings are anticipated to have a materially adverse effect on
the ability of Waddell & Reed,                                                  

P-->497Last�Page�of�3TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�3rd
Inc. to perform the services as distributor of the contracts. Among the legal   
proceedings to which Waddell & Reed, Inc. is a party are the following          
proceedings relating to the distribution of variable annuities:                 

On March 19, 2002, a jury found in favor of United Investors Life Insurance     
Company (UILIC) in a civil lawsuit filed by UILIC on May 4, 2000, in Alabama    
District Court against Waddell & Reed, Inc. and certain of its affiliated       
companies and assessed compensatory damages in the amount of $50 million        
dollars. The lawsuit primarily involved the enforceability of a letter agreement
signed by UILIC and Waddell & Reed, Inc. in July of 1999 and claims by UILIC    
that Waddell & Reed, Inc. tortiously interfered with its business relations by  
recommending to certain of its customers that they exchange their UILIC variable
annuities for variable annuities issued by Nationwide. On April 18, 2003, the   
Alabama Supreme Court reversed the $50 million dollar verdict against Waddell & 
Reed, Inc. and entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of Waddell & Reed,  
Inc. and its affiliates on the tortious interference, fraudulent suppression and
promissory fraud claims. The remaining claims were remanded for a new trial.    

UILIC has also filed a civil lawsuit against Waddell & Reed, Inc. and certain of
its affiliated companies in the Superior Court of the State of California on    
October 10, 2001, alleging violation of California Business and Professions Code
Section 17200, et seq. in connection with the same events that served as the    
basis for its Alabama lawsuit. UILIC seeks injunctive and monetary relief for   
alleged improper sales practices in connection with recommendations to certain  
customers residing in California that they exchange their UILIC variable        
annuities for variable annuities issued by Nationwide. Waddell & Reed, Inc. and 
its affiliated companies named in the lawsuit filed a motion to dismiss the     
case. The motion was denied, but Waddell & Reed, Inc. is contesting its denial. 
Waddell & Reed, Inc. denies any violation of the California Business and        
Professions Code and intends to vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit.

�
�
Item
  28.����������Indemnification
�
Provision
  is made in Nationwide�s Amended and Restated Code of Regulations and expressly
  authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio, for
  indemnification by Nationwide of any person who was or is a party or is
  threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
  suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
  by
  reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee
  of
  Nationwide, against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and
  amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person
  in
  connection with such action, suit or proceeding, to the extent and under the
  circumstances permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
  Ohio.
�
Insofar
  as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933
  ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling
  Nationwide pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Nationwide has been informed
  that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
  indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
  therefore, unenforceable.��In the event that a claim for
  indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
  registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
  person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
  proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
  connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless
  in
  the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
  submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
  indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
  will
  be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
