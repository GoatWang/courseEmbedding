					Our Custom Solutions
				



In addition to our standard line of PCB and M55302 connectors, IEH specializes in custom applications, many of which incorporate our Hyperboloid contact technology and meet the specific needs of our customer’s applications. Below are but a few examples of the types of custom connector solutions we’ve designed. We would be happy to review your current interconnect requirements, and work with you on a solution to suit your needs.








					CRM026
				






Semi-circular, stacking connectors for parallel boards inside a munitions chamber, where high reliability and high density were mission-critical.








					HDD
				






90-Pin, Hi-Speed Differential Pair, a ruggedized version of a Compact PCI connector.  Produced for an airborne radar application, where high speed data transmission was required, along with the durability of the hyperboloid contact.  This product is available with a matching 9-pin power module.








					HMC003
				






Non-Magnetic Power Interconnect, developed for NMR and MRI applications, where the high-current capabilities of hyperboloid sockets were required.








					HSM
				






D-shaped connectors for ruggedized medical and commercial applications, including docking stations, mobile diagnostic equipment and remote terminals.  The ability of the Hyperboloid contact to last over 100,000 mating cycles was preferred.








					HMC001
				






Single-pole connectors for high-power, high-vibration environments, both airborne and space.








					HKM
				






Power connector for Distribution Controller, for Commercial Avionics.










					Why Hyperboloid?
				



Hyperboloid contacts offer incredible reliability, performance, and endurance.

4 Star Quality Assurance
Our corporate goal is  to be 100% accurate on every IEH Corporation order that we process. We achieve this goal by  implementing several quality control checks throughout our distribution  process.
This IEH Corporation inspection  procedure includes:

IDEA-ICE-3000 (72-point)  visual inspection by (3) different quality inspectors.
Data sheet verification  of all parts.
Acetone swab test on  sample pieces.
Extensive views under  our macro zoom (200x) microscope for quality detection.
Digital photos of all  outgoing IEH Corporation parts.
We maintain a strict  approved vendor list (AVL).

4  Star Electronics also uses many customer satisfaction measurements to determine  our performance in the marketplace with distributors, major customers and the  ultimate end users of our products. Some of these measurements include customer surveys, on-time delivery and customer complaints. By doing this we have up to  date information on how we are doing on multiple levels which in return equals  complete customer satisfaction. Also by including customers in this process, we  are able to prioritize their requirements and prevent deviations in our  performance. As  part of our continual commitment to quality, all IEH Corporation parts that we receive are  inspected in our state-of-the-art ANSI/ESD-S20.20 certified facility located in  San Clemente, California.
