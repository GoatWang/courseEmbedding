BELLEVUE, Wash., Sept. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- DimensionalMechanics, an enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) company, today announced Michael Ryder will join the company's board of directors. Ryder was most recently senior vice president at Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., where he co-led story and franchise development for premier developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

With his background in the interactive entertainment sector and with flight simulation and avionics, Ryder will help guide DimensionalMechanics' rapid growth and development as it brings its scalable, cloud-based AI platform to multiple verticals, enabling enterprise users to equip existing systems with AI capabilities.
"I am pleased that Michael will be contributing to the vision and direction of DimensionalMechanics at a time of growth for the company – this is an exceptional milestone for us," said Rajeev Dutt, co-founder and CEO of DimensionalMechanics. "Michael's highly regarded work at Blizzard proves that he doesn't just know how to create the blueprint for a successful product, he knows how to execute and adapt it to distinct, challenging and evolving market circumstances."
Ryder has deep experience formulating successful plans to enter new markets, restructuring and returning companies to profitability and establishing new operations and strategic partnerships in emerging markets. He will lend his expertise to help guide the product roadmap for NeoPulse, the company's enterprise AI platform, assisting with long-term strategy and laying the groundwork for future market expansion. 
DimensionalMechanics recently introduced its first vertical solutions, including NeoPulse 3D, which was developed for games and interactive entertainment, among other uses. NeoPulse 3D mimics the way the mind perceives the real world by simulating the interaction of multiple 3D objects, rapidly profiling and rendering the underlying physics and optical characteristics.

The solution's uses span game development and animation, virtual and augmented reality, 3D simulation for the fashion and apparel industry, scientific simulation and more.
"What gets me most excited about joining DimensionalMechanics is the unprecedented versatility and scalability offered by NeoPulse to unlock new, unforeseen challenges across a spectrum of industries, including games and animation," said Ryder. "While offering the entertainment industry the tools to level up the fidelity of worlds and characters, NeoPulse's flexibility and seamless integration with existing systems and workflows will enable a wide range of industries to develop countless innovations and applications."
Prior to joining Blizzard Entertainment, Ryder founded SingleTrac and held senior positions at GT Interactive, Sierra Entertainment and the games division of the Walt Disney Company. Ryder graduated from the United States Naval Academy with a bachelor's of science in mathematics. He also holds a master's in business administration from the University of St. Thomas.
"We are building NeoPulse to capitalize on the significant impact that can be made in media, entertainment and design through artificial intelligence, and Michael's vast experience driving those industries will be invaluable to us," Dutt said.

BELLEVUE, Wash., March 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Today DimensionalMechanics, a company launching out of stealth to make artificial intelligence scalable in the enterprise, announced the close of an oversubscribed $4.7 million Series A round of financing and introduced NeoPulse™, a flexible cloud-based platform that will enable users to solve enterprise challenges by incorporating the power of AI into existing systems.








"We believe DimensionalMechanics has huge potential to bring the power of AI to bear on real-world market challenges across a range of verticals," said Kent L. Johnson, long-time Seattle VC /angel investor and DimensionalMechanics lead investor and board member. "By expanding the utility of AI as an applied science platform, the company is developing a horizontal platform flexible enough to address diverse challenges, rather than one that works in silos. Enterprise users want to unlock AI as a centerpiece of decision-making and operations – and DimensionalMechanics is forging the key."
The investment round is comprised of angel investors as well as full board and founder participation. The funding will allow DimensionalMechanics to accelerate platform development and expand its diverse team of AI experts, engineers, mathematicians, physicists and others. DimensionalMechanics is on track to release an MVP version of its core platform, NeoPulse, in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Still in early stages of development, NeoPulse is an extensible cloud platform that will enable developers to build limitless applications. The agnostic platform will work across systems and devices, allowing users to integrate AI capabilities without restructuring existing software stacks and workflows.
"We are on our way toward achieving our goal of building a robust AI platform that will enable enterprise users to answer far more complex questions than existing databases or AI systems currently allow – to move past answering, 'What?' so that we can answer, 'Why?'" said Rajeev Dutt, the company's co-founder and CEO. "To do this, we're not only building applicability into NeoPulse's very design, but taking a novel approach to machine learning."
NeoPulse understands what concepts are and makes connections – a sophisticated process of analysis and building associations to gain a broader understanding of the meaning of data and content. Dutt said his team is not trying to recreate a human brain, but to build a more sophisticated AI machine to reach the same endpoint that the human brain would.
"The current state of AI is like the early days of aircraft design. You can either try to replicate a bird, or you can focus on flying," Dutt said. "At DimensionalMechanics, we're focused on flying."
DimensionalMechanics is actively seeking strategic technology partnerships as it builds out NeoPulse's first phase of core capabilities. Based on DimensionalMechanics' proprietary algorithms, the multi-year vision is for NeoPulse to drive:

Prediction: Placing content in context and making massive levels of associations will support predictive analysis and allow users to answer much more complex questions than traditional databases; 
Content analysis and curation: The system can automatically experience rich data or content – watching a movie virtually, without human aid, for example – to learn from sensory input and understand sentiment, supporting robust media content analysis and curation; 
Complex simulation and synthesis: The platform is able to synthesize multiple data objects to produce complex and highly realistic simulations, which can improve and accelerate rendering and design processes, as well as economic and other modeling; 
Data optimization: NeoPulse will be able to filter out information that is unnecessary for human perception, delivering only what is needed and making data storage, management and distribution smarter, more efficient and less costly.
DimensionalMechanics is currently in discussions with multiple media and broadcast companies to build an application that will enhance media curation and analytics. It is also in talks with fashion and apparel technology providers to license technology and services DimensionalMechanics created to simulate highly realistic and dynamic 3D images based on body-type information and fabric properties.
"Our AI platform has incredible potential to address enterprise challenges across multiple sectors – but in the near term we are focused on establishing a strong foothold in broadcast media and 3D simulation for design," said Dave Hebert, co-founder and senior vice president of product. "We have an incredible team focused on these areas, which will give us a rock-solid launch pad into other verticals in the future."

DimensionalMechanics™ Puts Artificial Intelligence Within Reach for More Organizations

- Launches NeoPulse™ AI Studio to provide AI as a service
- Raised $6.7 million in funding with series B planned for this fall
- Forms new strategic alliance with GrayMeta




Jun 8, 2017, 9:00am EDT














BELLEVUE, Wash., June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- DimensionalMechanics™, a developer of foundational artificial intelligence (AI) technology and deep learning engineering, today introduced NeoPulse™ AI Studio, an intuitive set of applications that enable businesses and organizations to custom design AI solutions easily and quickly. The company has raised a total of $6.7 million in funding to date and is planning a series B round this fall. DimensionalMechanics also announced a strategic alliance with GrayMeta, a leader in automated metadata collection, curation and search, to be the first to offer NeoPulse AI to the media and entertainment industry. 
NeoPulse AI Studio is part of the NeoPulse Framework, an intuitive development and management platform for AI, offering a flexible suite of horizontal, reusable tools to meet the varying needs of organizations and users. NeoPulse Framework enables organizations to build, control and deploy AI solutions, without in-house machine learning (ML) expertise, reducing coding time by up to 85 percent. The NeoPulse Framework includes three primary components: NeoPulse AI Studio; NeoPulse AI Store, which enables organizations to monetize their creations; and a selection of pre-built AI models.  
"Today we unveiled NeoPulse AI Studio, which enables organizations to build their own customizable in-house AI solutions easily, without needing highly-trained AI specialists – essentially offering AI as a service," said Rajeev Dutt, CEO and Co-founder of DimensionalMechanics. "Historically, companies have to build AI solutions to answer one specific question, which can't be easily leveraged to address other issues. NeoPulse AI Studio radically changes the dynamic of how AI is developed by empowering developers with a common set of applications to address their evolving business needs. And, once a successful AI model is created, organizations can choose to use NeoPulse to share and monetize their efforts. Taken together, we're working to make AI more ubiquitous by providing foundational technology to help organizations create and distribute their own AI solutions."
Dutt continued, "Today also marks a major milestone, thanks to our strategic alliance with GrayMeta, whose clients include many well-known, global media brands. As the media and entertainment sector seeks innovative ways to apply machine learning, we look forward to making that faster and easier, together with GrayMeta."
"At GrayMeta, we enable some of the biggest motion picture studios, sport broadcasters and content owners to make the most of their valuable digital assets with a powerful set of metadata extraction, creation, curation and search tools," said Tom Szabo, Chief Executive Officer at GrayMeta. "DimensionalMechanics will give us the ability to rapidly deploy highly customizable AI solutions to dramatically improve content discovery and recommendations for our customers."  
NeoPulse AI Studio: Rapid Design and Deployment of AI Models
NeoPulse AI Studio offers AI as a service and uses simple, yet powerful, modeling language, which accelerates the development of AI solutions without the need for deep learning expertise, reducing coding time significantly. AI Studio uses patent-pending technology that functions like an oracle for AI to help organizations choose the best ML approach to use in building an AI solution.  AI Models that are produced using NeoPulse AI Studio are portable and reusable.
Key product features and benefits for NeoPulse AI Studio include:

Uses NeoPulse Modeling Language (NML) for automating the process of building AI models;
Enables dynamic AI model creation solution, using an efficient and easy-to-use language and command line interface that can be run on low cost commodity hardware;
Accelerates the development of AI models without the need for deep learning specialists;
Reduces lines of code from hundreds of lines of code to dozens;
Enables customization and refinements to models over time such as retraining models based on current data gathering;
Models can be trained on premise so that data never has to leave the organization's network;
Portable AI models that can either be deployed on premise or be pushed into the cloud for broader consumption; and
Includes performance and QA tools and an SDK.
A Universal AI Model Store and Off-the-Shelf Models
Once a successful AI model is created to solve a particular issue, there is no common or universal marketplace for organizations to share or monetize creations. NeoPulse AI Store, part of NeoPulse Framework, includes an AI model store, similar to an app store, which enables organizations to distribute, license and monetize their AI models. AI Studio is designed to scale exponentially as successful AI models in the store are licensed and used by additional users and organizations. 
For those organizations that do not want to build their own models, the AI store also includes off-the-shelf AI Models that are stand-alone software models in areas such as photo ranking, headline analysis, discovery and recommendations, character recognition, infrastructure anomaly detection and more. 
About DimensionalMechanics DimensionalMechanics Inc. was founded to make artificial intelligence (AI) accessible to organizations of all sizes. The company's NeoPulse Framework is an intuitive development and management platform for AI, and includes a suite of horizontal, reusable tools that enable companies to answer vital questions using a simplified and consistent approach. NeoPulse also enables organization to distribute and monetize their AI creations. Based in Bellevue, WA, the company's team brings decades of experience in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence from leading companies and research organizations.
About GrayMeta GrayMeta is a forward-thinking data company that powers automated metadata collection and represents a new way of extracting metadata across the enterprise. The GrayMeta Platform offers the freedom to extract, store, update and add intelligence to metadata which expands search-ability across more applications, turning information into valuable data.
