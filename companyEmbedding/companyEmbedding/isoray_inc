Why I Believe IsoRay Is Overvalued By At Least 40% From Its Current Price ($1.50 Target) - IsoRay, Inc. (NYSEMKT:ISR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Why I Believe IsoRay Is Overvalued By At Least 40% From Its Current Price ($1.50 Target)Mar.21.14 | About: IsoRay, Inc. (ISR) value investor right now Long/short equity, special situations, momentumValue Investor Right Now on TwitterSummaryThe stock has run upwards of 450% in a span of 5 trading days based on nothing of significance.The company most likely needs to raise additional capital, so further dilution likely.The only covering analyst of ISR (Maxim Group) still gives them a 12-month $1.50 target.A few days ago, a fellow Seeking Alpha writer (Sujan Lahiri) wrote an article on IsoRay Inc, (ISR) which featured a very positive interview with the CEO (Dwight Babcock) of the company, and furthermore, it included personal optimistic observations about the stock. It was published on March 14, when IsoRay's stock price was trading below $1. At the start of the bullish article, (Sujan Lahiri) said the following:
At current levels, we think this stock is dramatically undervalued. Most investors do not even know this company exists, and the handful investors who do know may not fully comprehend the story. Shares are currently trading at $0.80, but we think it should be trading at $3.00 as we speak.
This was not the first article that Sujan Lahiri did on ISR. One other one was written on September 23, 2014 and at that time ISR shares were trading around .60 cents. He gave then IsoRay Inc. a price target of $2.60. IsoRay Inc. shares then proceeded towards .72 cents over the next few days, before slowly falling back to below .50 cents for most of December 2013.
As I am writing this article, the stock price of ISR is actually at $3.60. Although there was news released on March 19 (regarding the treatment of a pediatric patient's tumor utilizing multiple Cesium-131 sutured seed meshes for internal radiation therapy), it is my belief that IsoRay Inc. is way overvalued at these extreme levels, and that it will again trade near the $1 to $1.50 per share levels once all this momentum-driven hoopla is done with, and investors realize that they are not holders of some unique and disruptive medical technology. IsoRay's Cesium-131 product has been around since 2003 (that's when they got their FDA approval) and if one looks at the stock chart of how it has performed during the last 5 years, one can see that it has not done much, until of course the last couple of days:


Technical Chart Analysis
Again, as I write this, ISR is trading around $3.60:

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on ISR is nearly 95 (!) This is not just extremely overbought, it's extremely extended. Here is an example of a few recent (other) high-flying stocks that reached the RSI 90+ levels:

I have circled in black the RSI for all three stocks at their "peak" and you can see what happened a few days later (there were no secondary's or dilutions in any of these three stocks shown as examples). In my 26+ years of experience in the stock market, I have learned that history repeats itself, no matter what stock it is or the sector it's in.

Previous Dilutions / Outstanding Warrants
On August 28, 2013, IsoRay, Inc. announced a secondary and warrants. Then the very next day, they decided to change the warrants terms. I won't bore you with the details (as you can read both of the filings for concrete details), the bottom line: the company issued 3.1 million warrants with a strike price of $0.53 to be exercised directly and 5.6 million warrants with a strike price of $0.72 exercisable after 6 months. Those are now exercisable as of March 1, 2014 since the six months have passed.
But I do also want you to notice that at the bottom of both of the (above) press releases, it is clearly stated that "Maxim Group LLC is acting as Sole Book Runner in connection with the offering." I promise much more on Maxim Group and their relationship with IsoRay Medical, which is coming up later in this article.
Now, please take a look at Page 10 of the 2nd Quarter Form10-Q filed. You will see that there are still 7.6 million additional outstanding warrants as of December 31, 2013, that can be exercised (from mostly under $1) during the years 2015-2017:

In the March 14, 2014 (Sujan Lahin) article, it is said:
"On the balance sheet sits about $6 million cash, $8 million in assets and no debt. Given the monthly cash burn of about $0.25 million, we believe IsoRay is fully funded for at least 16-20 months. This substantially diminishes any near-term dilution risk."
If one checks page 19 of the 2nd Quarter Form10-Q report, it is clearly stated that the "Company had approximately $4.31 million of cash and cash equivalents and no short-term investments as of February 6, 2014" So where does Sujan Lahiri get the $6 million number, as it's really just $4.31 million?

Furthermore, if you then look at the bottom of the same page again ( page 19 ) of the 10-Q, you will see this statement
"Based on the foregoing assumptions, management believes cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $4.31 million on hand at February 6, 2014 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months assuming both revenue and expenses remain at current levels."
Again, Sujan Lahiri makes an incorrect claim in his article that they have 16-20 months of funds.
So, the bottom line: Let me ask you: If you are willing to raise money when your stock is trading at $0.50 cents, do you think that the company will not want to use the opportunity - with the stock now more than 700% higher - to raise more cash and capital?
Information from Last 10-Q Filed
In the 2nd Quarter Form10-Q (filed 02-13-2014), the total number of outstanding shares is being listed (bottom of page 1) as: 41,540,982
Here are two other items of interest from the same Form 10-Q
Page 20:
"Management believes that the Company will require additional equity investment to maintain its common stock's listing status on the NYSE MKT."
Page 22:
Failure to Comply with NYSE MKT Listing Standards And Any Resulting Delisting Could Adversely Affect The Market For Our Common Stock. Our common stock is presently listed on the NYSE MKT. The NYSE MKT will consider delisting a company's securities if, among other things, the company fails to maintain minimum stockholder's equity or the company has sustained losses which are so substantial in relation to its overall operations or its existing financial resources, or its financial condition has become so impaired that it appears questionable, in the opinion of the NYSE MKT, as to whether such issuer will be able to continue operations and/or meet its obligations as they mature. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our listing on the NYSE MKT indefinitely. We anticipate falling below the minimum stockholders equity requirement for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. We may need to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated to meet listing standards if the warrants sold in August 2013 are not exercised. If we are unable to raise this capital our shares may become delisted.

Maxim Group & ISR
Maxim Group (a tiny boutique firm) started coverage of IsoRay Inc. on November 1, 2013 - which was a couple of months after they were the only book runner / underwriter in connection with the offering that was done in late August 2013. Maxim Group has done 4 Equity Research reports, and here is the summation of each:

November 1, 2013 ISR Stock Price: 0.53 Target Price: $1.50
January 8, 2014 ISR Stock Price: 0.55 Target Price: $1.50
January 31, 2014 ISR Stock Price: 0.74 Target Price: $1.50
February 20, 2014 ISR Stock Price: 0.77 Target Price: $1.50

Usually, I am unable to provide you with a full copy of the report (due to copyright), but in this case, IsoRay Inc. has put up a copy of it on their own website for free access. Here it is.
While reading it, please note these two important points:
• Maxim has never raised their target above $1.50. They are very clear in their last sentence of analysis: "Our 10-year DCF analysis supports a fair value of $1.50/share. [We expect] IsoRay to break-even in 2018 (meaning, stop losing money).
• Please read carefully exactly what is written on page 5 (under the Disclosures) of the same Maxim Group's February 20, 2014 Equity Research report on IsoRay Inc.:
Maxim Group managed/co-managed a public offering of the securities for IsoRay Inc. in the past 12 months
Maxim Group expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from IsoRay Inc. in the next 3 months
Maxim Group received compensation for investment banking services from IsoRay Inc. in the past 12 months
Maxim Group makes a market in IsoRay Inc.
So there you have it! This underlined statement clearly shows that it is very possible that another dilution (secondary offering or even more warrants) could be forthcoming to shareholders of IsoRay Inc.
And does Maxim Group think themselves that in IsoRay, Inc., they found incredible "disruptive" potential or some unique product line that will now just take-off and create huge sales? Just have a read ( Page 17 ) from Maxim Group's initiation of coverage report for ISR from November 2013:


Sluggish Market Uptake
ISR mostly relies on early adopters among surgeons to expand its brachytherapy market in non-prostate cancer indications. Success with the early adopters may not lead to wider adoption in the medical community. Doctors may have their own preferences when choosing treatments-a decision that could be driven by multiple factors, such as personal interpretation of safety and/or efficacy (both Proxcelan and GliaSite lack well-controlled clinical trials to support their safety and efficacy claims), technicality issues, and reimbursement issues. In addition, extra regulatory requirements associated with radioactive materials could delay penetration to the hospitals and clinics. Sluggish market uptake of these products may lead to lower-than-expected revenue growth.
Competition
In addition to the competing products we mentioned in the above discussion, traditional surgery, robotic surgery, external radiation, and chemotherapy could all compete against brachytherapy. We believe this competition explains the loss of share in prostate cancer brachytherapy in recent years. These same therapeutic alternatives are likely to compete in the non-prostate cancer applications.

Opinion of Others
Independent analysis of ISR monstrous run-up has brought out the following public commentary:
• TheStreet.com wrote an analysis on March 20, 2014 and gave ISR a SELL with a ratings score of D-• Adam Feuerstein, a Senior Columnist and leading expert on Biotechs, made the following comment (on March 19, 2014 - after the market had closed) on his official Twitter account (in response to a question from a colleague):
"$ISR move seems wildly disproportionate to significance of today's news but isn't this what no-name stocks do all the time?"


That comment was made when the stock closed at $2.55. Again, it is now $3.60.
Conclusion
I think that what IsoRay Inc. is doing for sick people is wonderful. It's great that a 12-year old boy might be given a better chance to survive. I have no qualms about the moral side of their company. But when it comes to valuing a company, it has nothing to do with what the company does. All that matters is growth potential, revenue and EPS. I don't smoke (and I hate having smokers around me), but did I ever short Phillip Morris (NYSE:PM)? Another example is that if I like Krispy Kreme (KKD) doughnuts, that doesn't mean I should run out and buy the company stock.
The significant problem that I have with IsoRay Inc. is their current valuation based on their current stock price. I strongly believe that it is way over-valued (based on current earnings/EPS) as long as it is trading anywhere over a $1. I can even live with the (12 month) $1.50 target that Maxim Group (rightfully, their biggest cheerleader) has given them. Again, I ask to you please read their report and realize that this $1.50 target is a 60%+ drop from the current price levels that ISR is trading at.
If there is anything else which is eye-opening for me, please go back to the article that Sujan Lahiri wrote and locate the interview with the CEO. Sujan Lahiri asks the CEO (Dwight Babcock) a direct question and gets a direct answer:
Question: What do you think IsoRay is actually worth today?
Dwight Babcock (CEO): I believe easily $1.50-2.50 per share.
So the CEO himself thinks that the ISR should be valued at $2 (the median of his range). We all know how CEO's always think that their companies are undervalued and given that this would be his high estimate, it again brings me back to the $1 to $1.50 level as the rightful number until IsoRay starts improving their revenue and EPS numbers.
On a personal note: I should also add that in my opinion, when a CEO explicitly touts a fair price (or price range) for his company's stock, for me it's always a major red flag. To do such a thing (again, in my opinion) is inappropriate, if not unethical.

There have been a few micro-cap biotech stocks that had these astronomical shooting stars during the last couple of months. Almost all of them soon gave back at least 35% to 40% from their peak prices, and I see exactly the same thing happening to ISR when the momentum players leave. In addition, I am a strong believer that some kind of dilution is forthcoming and that will speed-up the downward spiral of IsoRay Inc. stock price. There is just no logical reason why anyone should be buying ISR at these levels and why it should will hold on to these massive gains.

					Full Description



IsoRay, Inc., incorporated on July 13, 1983, is a medical technology company. The Company, through its subsidiary, IsoRay Medical, Inc., develops, manufactures and sells isotope-based medical products and devices for the treatment of cancer and other malignant diseases. The Company is engaged in the production and sales of Cesium-131 (Cs-131) brachytherapy seeds. Brachytherapy seeds are small devices containing a therapeutic dose of radiation used in an interstitial radiation procedure. The brachytherapy procedure places radioactive seeds as close as possible to (in or near) the cancerous tumor.The Cs-131 includes radioisotope in the treatment of all malignant tumors, such as prostate cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gynecological cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, ocular melanoma and pancreatic cancer. The brachytherapy seed form (a sealed source) of Cs-131 may be used in surface, interstitial and intra-cavity applications for tumors with known radio-sensitivity. Cs-131 is a radioactive isotope that can be produced by the neutron bombardment of Barium-130 (Ba-130). The Company's Proxcelan Cesium-131 seed is classified as a Class II device.The Company competes with Varian Medical Systems, Siemens Healthcare, Elekta AB and Accuray Incorporated.

IsoRay, Inc. Announces Publication of Study Entitled, "Clinical Outcomes of Large Brain Metastases Treated with Neurosurgical Resection and Intraoperative Cesium-131 Brachytherapy
Jun 20 17
IsoRay, Inc. announced the publication of a study entitled, "Clinical Outcomes of Large Brain Metastases Treated with Neurosurgical Resection and Intraoperative Cesium-131 Brachytherapy: Results of a Prospective Trial" in the highly respected International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (the 'Red Journal')." The study was published on the Red Journal's website on June 12, 2017. The study was conducted by Gabriella A. Wernicke, M.D., M.Sc. and Theodore H. Schwartz M.D., of the Stich Radiation Oncology Center and Department of Neurosurgery, Brain and Spine Center, Weill Cornell Medical College/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, NYC, NY. The study assessed the impact of permanent low-dose rate Cesium-131 brachytherapy on local control and radionecrosis (RN) in patients treated for large brain metastases. Forty-two patients with a total of 46 metastases >2.0 cm in preoperative diameter were accrued onto a prospective trial between 2010 and 2015. Patients underwent surgical resection with intra-operative placement of stranded Cesium-131 seeds as permanent volume implants in the resection cavity. The study demonstrated a 100% freedom from local progression rate, meaning that the surgically removed brain metastases did not re-grow. In addition, there was a 0% rate of radionecrosis, a significant side effect of radiation therapy to the brain. Radiation necrosis is especially problematic when larger brain metastases (with diameters 2 cm or larger) are treated with radiation. The study's authors concluded that intraoperative Cesium-131 brachytherapy is a safe and effective adjuvant therapy for large brain metastases requiring neurosurgical intervention.

IntelGenx has an exclusive license for oral films from Lilly for its dosing patent, which would allow Tadalafil to enter the ED market in the U.S. free from patent litigation from Lilly. Dr. Matzen explains that Tadalafil, which offers a discrete dosing alternative, could enter the market in 2018, with up to three years of market exclusivity before Cialis is hit with generic competition.Tadalafil is an erectile dysfunction (ED) treatment that boasts bioequivalence with Cialis, the current leading brand, and with a successful biostudy in-hand a 505(b)(2) NDA is set to be filed any day now, meaning that a full launch should be expected in mid-2018. Cialis is already winning-out over Viagra in terms of numbers of prescriptions, which is largely down to price and efficacy, but when Tadalafil comes to market with the same product in a more convenient and discreet delivery mechanism, IntelGenX should see a massive number of customers take-up its services.MoreIntelGenx has multi-faceted BD approach for its oral filmsWith a burgeoning pipeline of pharmaceutical oral films, IntelGenx’s   (OTCQX:IGXT; TSXV:IGX) business development strategy is focused on   partnering its product pipeline along with actively meeting with potential   partners to explore manufacturingwww.biotuesdays.comReply51oorchardMore news, Not moving, One Day ISR will be HUGE! http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301617307459Clinical Outcomes of Large Brain Metastases Treated with Neurosurgical Resection and Intraoperative Cesium-131 Brachytherapy: Results of a Prospective Trialwww.sciencedirect.comReplyReplies (5)13DDavidLets Bring Back Babcock...ReplyReplies (3)02DDavidWhen is the Sales Team Going to Work..We don't hear much about Sales....Whats up ????????????...Not sales and no profit no stock...maybe do a little cutting  for a bit and just that would help..??? remember for the share holders and future share holders and YES QUALITY PRODUCT TOO.........Reply01jjohnI understood ISR saved a horse and some girl from peru.Reply10jjohnI bought this POS at 60 cents.....should have known!ReplyReplies (1)00jjohnStanford school of medicine using proteins to fight brain.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

Reports Fiscal Year 2014 ResultsMarketwiredSeptember 30, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareRICHLAND, WA--(Marketwired - Sep 30, 2014) - IsoRay Inc. (  NYSE MKT :  ISR ), a medical technology company and innovator in seed brachytherapy and medical radioisotope applications, announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended June 30, 2014.In fiscal year 2014, IsoRay made significant progress in its efforts to focus on non-prostate cancer treatments and expand brachytherapy use in aggressive cancers found throughout the body. Overall, sales declined slightly, primarily due to a continuing weak prostate treatment market with less PSA screening being performed. However, recently released peer reviewed publications reporting positively on Cesium-131 in the treatment of cancer have continued to provide proof and evidence of our product's effectiveness as reported by industry leaders within the medical field. Sales to the major medical centers that originally performed many of the efficacy studies on Cesium-131 remain strong and continue to order beyond the initial studies. Orders exceeding the established study minimums required for statistical significance imply that the product must be working well for these institutions. These early adopters are seeing firsthand the results being achieved even though time must elapse, allowing their data to mature, prior to any publication of the results. Management believes market interest is growing in the following areas: the treatment of brain cancers (meningiomas, brain metastases and glioblastomas); lung cancer (NSCLC); gynecological cancer; prostate cancer; head and neck cancer; and liquid Cesium-131 in the GliaSite® Radiation Therapy System, used to treat brain cancers.IsoRay Chairman and CEO Dwight Babcock commented, "2014 was a monumental year in the number of achievements IsoRay completed, particularly for a company our size. We are committed to positioning IsoRay as the premier brachytherapy company offering cancer solutions throughout the body. We are now actively soliciting new institutions based on our published results, in an effort to have them join existing studies or start their own. In the future we expect to have additional reports reflecting similar successes as the early adopters have achieved. Currently, we are attracting new centers based on published results and new major medical centers are applying for licenses and joining multi institutional studies or initiating their own. IsoRay's products for both prostate and other cancers continue to receive great reviews with numerous papers being submitted for publication and early stage posters/abstracts being presented at various medical society conventions. Cesium-131, I can confidently say, is the isotope of the future and will prove to be the premier isotope providing safe and effective cancer treatment throughout the body with a strong emphasis on quality of life."Major milestones achieved during the 2014 fiscal year include:IsoRay's Cesium-131 was used for the first time in treating colon cancer. FDA cleared the use of liquid Cesium-131 (Cesitrex®) in the GliaSite® Radiation Therapy Balloon Catheter System. Gynecologic Oncologic published the first peer reviewed report showing the efficacy of Cesium-131 for gynecological cancer - "Implementation and early clinical results utilizing Cs-131 permanent interstitial implants for gynecologic malignancies." IsoRay's liquid Cesium-131 (Cesitrex®) was used with GliaSite® in treating metastatic brain cancer. IsoRay added two new international distributors operating in Russia and Peru. Cesium-131 was used for the first time to treat a recurrent metastatic Wilms Tumor. IsoRay's Cesium-131 seeded mesh was used for the first time for advanced rectal cancer. IsoRay completed a major capital raise providing substantial capitalization. A substantial percentage of IsoRay's outstanding warrants were exercised. Cesium-131 seeds were selected to be stranded for use with C-4 Imaging's new positive MRI markers. IsoRay was added to the Russell Microcap Index. IsoRay's subsidiary in May completed an annual audit ISO13485:2330 from BSI (British Standards Institution) with no nonconformities, confirming IsoRay's manufacturing and quality assurance systems.          IsoRay, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Consolidated Statements of Operations                 Year ended         June 30,         2014     2013                         Product sales   $ 4,219,158     $ 4,525,233     Cost of product sales     4,415,629       4,375,057                           Gross profit / (loss)     (196,471 )     150,176                         Operating expenses:                     Research and development expenses     668,803       627,107       Sales and marketing expenses     1,234,725       1,296,149       General and administrative expenses     2,488,219       2,294,173         Total operating expenses     4,391,747       4,217,429                             Operating loss     (4,588,218 )     (4,067,253 )                       Non-operating income (expense):                     Interest income     12,113       664       Change in fair value of warrant liability     (1,382,134 )     210,000       Financing and interest expense     (883 )     (7 )       Non-operating income (expense), net     (1,370,904 )     210,657                         Net loss     (5,959,122 )     (3,856,596 )     Preferred stock deemed dividends (Note 11)     (726,378 )     -       Preferred stock dividends     (10,632 )     (10,632 )                       Net loss applicable to                   common shareholders   $ (6,696,132 )   $ (3,867,228 )                       Basic and diluted loss per share   $ (0.16 )   $ (0.11 )                       Weighted average shares used in computing net loss per share:                   Basic and diluted     42,675,158       34,423,420                        The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.About IsoRay, Inc  IsoRay, Inc., through its subsidiary, IsoRay Medical, Inc. is the exclusive producer of Cesium-131 internal radiation therapy, which is expanding brachytherapy options throughout the body. Learn more about this innovative Richland, Washington company and explore the many benefits and uses of Cesium-131 by visiting www.isoray.com.Safe Harbor Statement  Statements in this news release about IsoRay's future expectations, including: the advantages of our products and their delivery systems, whether sales of our products will continue at historic levels, decrease or increase, whether the use of our products will increase or continue, whether future studies of treatment of various cancers using our products will have favorable results, whether awareness of our products in the medical community will continue or increase, whether we will maintain required manufacturing standards and quality assurance processes, future demand for IsoRay's existing and planned products, whether revenue and other financial metrics will improve in future periods, whether IsoRay will be able to continue to expand its base beyond prostate cancer, whether additional studies will be published or presented with favorable outcomes from treatment with our products, and all other statements in this release, other than historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA").
