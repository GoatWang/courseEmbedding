Robotics “THE FUTURE IS OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS” – Web Movie –





Robotics

				Hitachi’s robotics contributes to society in various areas
            





					Hitachi develops a wide variety of robots integrated with an IoT platform to improve people’s lives.
				





                        IoT has accelerated co-creation between companies and has helped create new value. But in order to leverage the full potential of IoT, data processing must go beyond cyberspace. New and innovative services in the real world will depend on our ability to combine data with physical operations. That’s why robotics will play such a crucial role moving forward, as they become our bridge between the real and virtual worlds.
					

						At Hitachi, we’ve developed a wide range of robots for various applications by leveraging our expertise in operational technologies (OT). But we’re not developing technologies without reason. We’re implementing social innovation. By integrating robots with IoT platforms, and using that technology in social infrastructures, we’re actively promoting initiatives to improve people’s lives.
					










Humanoid Robot "EMIEW3" and Robotics IT Platform for Customer Services （Short Version） - Hitachi






EMIEW3 is a human symbiotic robot that aggregates data obtained from various external sensors.
Information necessary for providing services is then processed over a cloud-based robotics IT platform and fed back to the robot – helping it navigate, communicate, and interact with its surroundings.This IT infrastructure can also be integrated with existing operational systems to provide business intelligence by processing various kinds of relevant information. We also offer business solutions with interconnected robots.






					At Hitachi, we’ve been developing robotics technology for over half a century, while focusing on co-creation with clients to generate new value.
                





						The history of Hitachi Group’s robotics dates back to the 1960s with our Servo-Manipulator, a remote controlled device for nuclear power plant operations.Since then, Hitachi has introduced a wide variety of robots – from mechatronic products, such as semiconductor testing equipment and financial devices, to robots for extreme environments like nuclear power plants.

						With Hitachi’s R&D focusing on the development of automatic control and intelligent processing, our advanced robotics has served as the vehicle bringing these technologies to life.In 2005, Hitachi became one of the first companies to develop a human symbiotic robot. Rolling out improved functions in phases with new elemental technologies, by 2016 Hitachi proudly introduced EMIEW3, a service-assistance robot that can talk and work with people.
                    





                    We’re also focusing on co-creation with clients to generate new value. Currently, we’re actively setting up new facilities for conducting demonstration experiments, with multiple collaborative spaces already in operation to implement high-quality prototyping alongside our clients.
				




                    The proliferation of IoT in recent years has seen a wide array of information and knowledge stored in cyberspace. This shift has also made real-world applications of digital solutions increasingly realistic through robotics.
                    As we develop robotics solutions for the age of IoT, we’ll continue to drive social innovation forward, solving today’s challenges for a better future.
				




Hitachi has developed a wide variety of robotsthat offer new value to customers.





EMIEW3 is a Human Symbiotic Robot that Actively Communicates with People
EMIEW3 draws from Hitachi’s extensive expertise in robotics and digital solutions to realize a high level of autonomy. A cloud-based IT infrastructure serves as a “remote brain”, which monitors and controls the robot’s body. This brain connected with the robot’s body in real time also gives EMIEW3 the ability to communicate, navigate through its surroundings, and provide customer support and guidance.By accurately understanding situations in various service settings, EMIEW3 is able to recognize and approach those in need. It can even start up a conversation on its own to provide services — improving user satisfaction and  business efficiency.
								

								*For the practical application,EMIEW3 is conducting a demonstration test.

ROPITS is a Single-Passenger Mobility Support Robot that Autonomously Travels on Sidewalks
ROPITS is a single-passenger mobility support robot that features autonomous transportation. ROPITS can be summoned easily from anywhere in the city using a map on a mobile information device. Once summoned, ROPITS autonomously travels to the designated point to pick up and transport passengers to their destination. It automatically avoids obstacles through a 3D environmental recognition technology integrating multiple sensors. It also has active suspensions mounted onboard, which give it stability even on winding or uneven paths. We expect ROPITS to help the elderly and those with difficulty walking to support short-distance trips.

								*For the practical application,ROPITS is conducting a demonstration test.

The Autonomous Mobile Dual Arm Robot that’s Pioneering the Future of Logistics
Consumer needs are becoming increasingly diversified, and logistics is becoming even more complex as a result. While these trends are giving rise to a demand for more streamlined warehouse operations, current automation equipment can only be used for certain types of products and work, which limits their application.At Hitachi, we’ve developed an autonomous mobile dual arm robot that opens new opportunities for warehouses. Equipped with two commercially sold industrial arms, this robot comes with an elevating platform mounted on a travelling truck to enable height adjustments. It also includes a gripper that automates manual operations, such as pulling out shelves and picking out products.The dual arm robot uses built-in sensors to understand its own position and the location of products that need to be picked. While in motion, it can also identify specific products before picking them out from the shelves.But there’s more to this robot than order picking. With its dual arms, this advanced technology can also complete complex tasks that require coordination between two arms.With the advancement of our automation technologies, the future of logistics is closer than ever.  
*The autonomous mobile dual arm robot is still in its development stages and it is yet to be determined when it will be put to practical use.

Using Carbon Fiber in Industrial Automation and Robotics
Facilities incorporating industrial automation into their manufacturing processes continually strive to improve efficiency through increased speed and greater precision. Often the most direct means to achieve these goals is reduced weight and increased stiffness of the robotics, and in particular the end effectors. Lightweight end effectors translate directly to increased speed on the production line, higher precision, reduced motor and actuator loads, and improved reliability. For many application, such as injection molding, a 0.1 second reduction in cycle time translates into a yearly savings of $300,000 or more. One of our customers actually saved $1 million a year with a custom carbon fiber robotic arm solution we helped them develop.

DragonPlate works with companies in the consumer products, semiconductor, beverage, injection molding, aerospace, and automotive industries, as well as many others that utilize robotics in their manufacturing or inspection processes. In addition, we work with companies that specialize in the design and fabrication of automated systems to replace their obsolete metal end effectors with lightweight carbon fiber composites, with typical weight reductions of 50%-75%.

Many carbon fiber options are available to robotics and automation designers. Using basic structural materials (flat sheets, angles, hat stiffeners, c-channels, rectangular tubes), lightweight end effectors can easily be designed and implemented, often into existing manufacturing lines with minimal other changes. With relative ease 40 pound end effectors can be reduced to 15 pounds or less, substantially reducing vibration, as well as bearing and motor wear. 

By utilizing our DragonPlate tube connector systems, a myriad of additional options are available. For example, square and rectangular tubes can be connected with flat gusset plates creating extremely strong, yet lightweight frames. Pultruded round tubes are easily connected using our patented universal joint connector system to form trusses. And our patent pending modular connector system provides an efficient and extremely robust way to make easily disassembled carbon fiber tubular structures out of our braided and roll-wrapped round tubes.

Leveraging in-house finite element analysis, CAD design, and tool making, DragonPlate regularly works with customers to produce highly specialized robotics and automation end effectors. We specialize in custom components and assemblies, bladder molded high modulus prepreg parts for complex geometries and lowest weight, and the utilization of a wide variety of ancillary materials to complement the carbon fiber, such as Kevlar.

For those companies whose operating temperatures regularly reach between 250 and 500 degree Fahrenheit, DragonPlate also offers a high temperature carbon fiber that can withstand said temperatures for extended periods of time.  This new material can survive direct exposure to a propane torch for 30 to 60 seconds with only a minor reduction in stiffness and is perfect for those in high temperature automation looking to significantly reduce the weight of their tools.


If your company is interested in learning more about using carbon fiber composites in robotic end effectors and automation, please contact us to discuss your specific application.

That’s why robotics will play such a crucial role moving forward, as they become our bridge between the real and virtual worlds.
					

						At Hitachi, we’ve developed a wide range of robots for various applications by leveraging our expertise in operational technologies (OT). But we’re not developing technologies without reason. We’re implementing social innovation. By integrating robots with IoT platforms, and using that technology in social infrastructures, we’re actively promoting initiatives to improve people’s lives.
					










Humanoid Robot "EMIEW3" and Robotics IT Platform for Customer Services （Short Version） - Hitachi






EMIEW3 is a human symbiotic robot that aggregates data obtained from various external sensors.
Information necessary for providing services is then processed over a cloud-based robotics IT platform and fed back to the robot – helping it navigate, communicate, and interact with its surroundings.This IT infrastructure can also be integrated with existing operational systems to provide business intelligence by processing various kinds of relevant information. We also offer business solutions with interconnected robots.






					At Hitachi, we’ve been developing robotics technology for over half a century, while focusing on co-creation with clients to generate new value.
                





						The history of Hitachi Group’s robotics dates back to the 1960s with our Servo-Manipulator, a remote controlled device for nuclear power plant operations.Since then, Hitachi has introduced a wide variety of robots – from mechatronic products, such as semiconductor testing equipment and financial devices, to robots for extreme environments like nuclear power plants.

						With Hitachi’s R&D focusing on the development of automatic control and intelligent processing, our advanced robotics has served as the vehicle bringing these technologies to life.In 2005, Hitachi became one of the first companies to develop a human symbiotic robot. Rolling out improved functions in phases with new elemental technologies, by 2016 Hitachi proudly introduced EMIEW3, a service-assistance robot that can talk and work with people.
                    





                    We’re also focusing on co-creation with clients to generate new value. Currently, we’re actively setting up new facilities for conducting demonstration experiments, with multiple collaborative spaces already in operation to implement high-quality prototyping alongside our clients.
				




                    The proliferation of IoT in recent years has seen a wide array of information and knowledge stored in cyberspace. This shift has also made real-world applications of digital solutions increasingly realistic through robotics.
                    As we develop robotics solutions for the age of IoT, we’ll continue to drive social innovation forward, solving today’s challenges for a better future.
				




Hitachi has developed a wide variety of robotsthat offer new value to customers.





EMIEW3 is a Human Symbiotic Robot that Actively Communicates with People
EMIEW3 draws from Hitachi’s extensive expertise in robotics and digital solutions to realize a high level of autonomy. A cloud-based IT infrastructure serves as a “remote brain”, which monitors and controls the robot’s body. This brain connected with the robot’s body in real time also gives EMIEW3 the ability to communicate, navigate through its surroundings, and provide customer support and guidance.By accurately understanding situations in various service settings, EMIEW3 is able to recognize and approach those in need. It can even start up a conversation on its own to provide services — improving user satisfaction and  business efficiency.
								

								*For the practical application,EMIEW3 is conducting a demonstration test.

The Autonomous Mobile Dual Arm Robot that’s Pioneering the Future of Logistics
Consumer needs are becoming increasingly diversified, and logistics is becoming even more complex as a result. While these trends are giving rise to a demand for more streamlined warehouse operations, current automation equipment can only be used for certain types of products and work, which limits their application.At Hitachi, we’ve developed an autonomous mobile dual arm robot that opens new opportunities for warehouses. Equipped with two commercially sold industrial arms, this robot comes with an elevating platform mounted on a travelling truck to enable height adjustments. It also includes a gripper that automates manual operations, such as pulling out shelves and picking out products.The dual arm robot uses built-in sensors to understand its own position and the location of products that need to be picked. While in motion, it can also identify specific products before picking them out from the shelves.But there’s more to this robot than order picking. With its dual arms, this advanced technology can also complete complex tasks that require coordination between two arms.With the advancement of our automation technologies, the future of logistics is closer than ever.  
*The autonomous mobile dual arm robot is still in its development stages and it is yet to be determined when it will be put to practical use.
