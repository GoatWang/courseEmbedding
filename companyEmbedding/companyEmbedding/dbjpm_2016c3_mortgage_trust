      Fitch to Rate DBJPM 2016-C3 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mtge Trust 
      Pass-Through Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





July 21, 2016 01:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on DBJPM Mortgage Trust 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2016-C3.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$33,545,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$6,084,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$279,987,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$700,467,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$45,804,000ab class X-D ' BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45,804,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17,874,000a class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$8,938,000a class F.
    

      --$10,054,000a class G.
    

      --$29,047,404a class H.
    

      a)Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b)Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of July 18, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 32 loans secured by 54 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $893,738,404 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JP Morgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association and German American Capital Corporation.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 82.7% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 91.0% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Leverage Lower than Recent Deals: The transaction has lower leverage 
      than other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's weighted average 
      (WA) Fitch DSCR of 1.19x is better than both the YTD 2016 average of 
      1.16x and the 2015 average of 1.18x. The pool's WA Fitch LTV of 104.8% 
      is better than both the YTD 2016 average of 107.5% and the 2015 average 
      of 109.3%. Excluding the credit opinion loans (15% of the pool), the 
      Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.15x and 112.3%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Two of the six largest loans in 
      the pool have investment-grade credit opinions. Westfield San Francisco 
      Centre (9.4% of the pool) is the largest loan in the pool and has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf' on a stand-alone basis. The 
      Shops at Crystals (5.6% of the pool), has an investment-grade credit 
      opinion of 'BBB+sf' on a stand-alone basis. The implied credit 
      enhancement levels for the conduit portion of the transaction for 
      'AAAsf' and 'BBB-sf' are 24.250% and 8.625%, respectively.
    

      High Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated than other recent 
      Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The top 10 loans comprise 64% of 
      the pool, which is greater the YTD 2016 average of 54.8% and the 2015 
      average of 49.3%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) of 518 is 
      above the YTD 2016 average of 422 and the 2015 average of 367. 
      Additionally, the pool's sponsor concentration index (SCI) of 831 is 
      significantly higher than the YTD 2016 average of 482 and the 2015 
      average of 410. Two sponsors, CIM Commercial Trust Corporation and Simon 
      Property Group, each represent more than 10% of the pool with 17.2% and 
      14.5%, respectively.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11% below the most 
      recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to DBJPM 2016-C3 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young, LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
