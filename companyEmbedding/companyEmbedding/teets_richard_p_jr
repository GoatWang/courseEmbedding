			Richard P. Teets, Jr. is a co-founder of our Company and has been a director since inception. Prior to his retirement on March 31, 2016, Mr. Teets had been our Executive Vice President for Steelmaking and President and Chief Operating Officer of Steel Operations since August 2008. In April 2007, Mr. Teets became an Executive Vice President, overseeing the Company's four long-products steelmaking divisions and the steel fabricating business, New Millennium Building Systems. In 1998, Mr. Teets initiated the planning for construction of the Company's structural-steel mill at Columbia City, Indiana. From 1998 to 2007, he managed the construction, start-up, and operation of the structural mill and was responsible for its commercial success and growth. From 1993 to early 1996, Mr. Teets was responsible for the planning and construction of the Company's pioneering flat roll steel mill in Butler, Indiana as well as its subsequent construction of a cold rolled facility, after which he became Vice President and General Manager of Rolling and Finishing at the flat roll mill. Prior to that, after a ten year career at J&L Steel (later LTV Steel), Mr. Teets joined Nucor Corporation in 1987 as an engineering manager at Crawfordsville, Indiana, where he was given broad responsibility for the design and construction of its new thin-slab-casting facility at that location. Thereafter, in 1991, he assumed responsibility for Nucor's Crawfordsville, Indiana cold-rolling and finishing operations. Mr. Teets holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Lafayette College (1977) and a master's degree in business administration from Duquesne University (1982). Mr. Teets was named the Steel Advocate of the Year during 2016 by the American Metal Market. Mr. Teets brings to the Board a strong academic and operational background and business experience in the design, construction and operation of steel mill facilities, as well as demonstrated leadership in organizing, budgeting for and directing complex projects, both at the construction and operational levels.

Top Buys by Top Brass: Executive Vice President Teets Jr.'s $112.5K Bet on STLD

A company's own top management tend to have the best inside view
into the business, so when company officers make major buys,
investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason an
insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock
of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make
money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they
see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this
series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass''
over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of
$112.5K by Richard P. Teets Jr., Executive Vice President at Steel
Dynamics Inc. (Symbol: STLD).

compares with a last trade of $19.36.

the Steel ETF (Symbol: SLX) which is trading up by about 0.7% on
the day Wednesday.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

The U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday it had made a final finding that exports of steel concrete reinforcing bar from Taiwan were dumped. The U.S. International Trade Commission will announce in August whether Taiwan's rebar exports hurt U.S. producers, which would prompt an order to keep anti-dumping duties in place.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
