CREATING VALUE FROM
SORBENT MINERALS










 
 










History









Company News









Careers









Oil-Dri began with a goal to provide products that would improve workplace safety. Since then, we have become a worldwide leader in producing, marketing and selling sorbent mineral technology. Although much about our company has changed since 1941, our values and business ethics have stayed the same. We remain a family-controlled and family-operated organization that emphasizes honesty, integrity and accountability. We foster a resourceful and pioneering spirit within our team members in order to create sorbent mineral products for a diverse group of industries, spanning both consumer and business to business markets.
Our corporate mission is to Create Value From Sorbent Minerals. We embrace that mission daily through innovation and a strong commitment to our founding principles. We are passionate about continuously improving the value our customers receive from our products and services. At Oil-Dri, our past drives our future… a future full of opportunity.






Over 75 Years of Discovery We have a long history of innovation, ethical principles and teamwork. In fact, it’s been over 75 years since the company first opened its doors. In that time, we have introduced numerous new applications for our sorbent minerals, upheld the values that our company was founded on and maintained a strong dedication to providing value to our customers. Learn more about our story by watching the video below.







Annual Dividends Oil-Dri has a strong commitment to our investors. We have paid cash dividends continuously since 1974 and have increased dividends annually since 2003. In fiscal year 2016, the annual common stock dividend totaled $0.84 per share.





Investing in Innovation Innovation is the backbone of our company. We invest millions of dollars in new product development and technical support for our company’s comprehensive product portfolio. This investment in the future enables us to continually produce unique mineral solutions for our customers.





Partnership With Katherine Heigl At Oil-Dri, we take pride in supporting organizations that are dedicated to making a difference. That’s why we’ve partnered with Katherine Heigl, award-winning actress and CEO of The Jason Debus Heigl Foundation™, to promote Cat’s Pride® Fresh & Light Ultimate Care® cat litter. We are proud that a portion of every sale of Fresh & Light Ultimate Care products assists the foundation and its mission to end animal cruelty.







We Care We became successful by standing on the shoulders of those who came before us and by building a team that embodies the same core values upon which Oil-Dri was built. We are nearly 800 strong, living on five of the world’s seven continents. We care about our team and statistics prove that our team cares about us. Our average teammate tenure is eleven years. We not only pride ourselves on Oil-Dri’s three generations of leadership, but are extremely humbled that 10% of our team is represented by more than one family member or generation. Visit our Careers page to learn more about our culture and browse open positions.





Our past drives our future As our organization grows, we find value in reflecting on the milestones that have led us to where we are today. Visit our history page to experience an interactive timeline that highlights the people, discoveries and events that have contributed to our success.





Our team culture Each of our team members contributes their own unique personality, perspective and personal set of skills to the organization. Together, we make up a thriving, close-knit, global community that feels more like family than a workforce. Visit our team page to explore testimonials and get a sense for our culture.





Knowledge is power Innovation is the cornerstone of Oil-Dri’s advancement. We have an extensive research and development program that has resulted in many breakthrough products and market applications. Explore our innovation page for a deeper look at how we have created value-added products from specialty minerals.





OUR TEAM IS OUR FAMILY Over the past 75 years, our organization has grown to a team of nearly 800 individuals. Throughout this growth, we have managed to preserve a vibrant, family-oriented atmosphere that attracts high-quality, dedicated teammates. If you are searching for fulfilling work with dedicated, forward-thinking people, we encourage you to explore our career opportunities.

CREATING VALUE FROM
SORBENT MINERALS










 
 










History









Company News









Careers









Oil-Dri began with a goal to provide products that would improve workplace safety. Since then, we have become a worldwide leader in producing, marketing and selling sorbent mineral technology. Although much about our company has changed since 1941, our values and business ethics have stayed the same. We remain a family-controlled and family-operated organization that emphasizes honesty, integrity and accountability. We foster a resourceful and pioneering spirit within our team members in order to create sorbent mineral products for a diverse group of industries, spanning both consumer and business to business markets.
Our corporate mission is to Create Value From Sorbent Minerals. We embrace that mission daily through innovation and a strong commitment to our founding principles. We are passionate about continuously improving the value our customers receive from our products and services. At Oil-Dri, our past drives our future… a future full of opportunity.






Over 75 Years of Discovery We have a long history of innovation, ethical principles and teamwork. In fact, it’s been over 75 years since the company first opened its doors. In that time, we have introduced numerous new applications for our sorbent minerals, upheld the values that our company was founded on and maintained a strong dedication to providing value to our customers. Learn more about our story by watching the video below.







Annual Dividends Oil-Dri has a strong commitment to our investors. We have paid cash dividends continuously since 1974 and have increased dividends annually since 2003. In fiscal year 2016, the annual common stock dividend totaled $0.84 per share.





Investing in Innovation Innovation is the backbone of our company. We invest millions of dollars in new product development and technical support for our company’s comprehensive product portfolio. This investment in the future enables us to continually produce unique mineral solutions for our customers.





Partnership With Katherine Heigl At Oil-Dri, we take pride in supporting organizations that are dedicated to making a difference. That’s why we’ve partnered with Katherine Heigl, award-winning actress and CEO of The Jason Debus Heigl Foundation™, to promote Cat’s Pride® Fresh & Light Ultimate Care® cat litter. We are proud that a portion of every sale of Fresh & Light Ultimate Care products assists the foundation and its mission to end animal cruelty.







We Care We became successful by standing on the shoulders of those who came before us and by building a team that embodies the same core values upon which Oil-Dri was built. We are nearly 800 strong, living on five of the world’s seven continents. We care about our team and statistics prove that our team cares about us. Our average teammate tenure is eleven years. We not only pride ourselves on Oil-Dri’s three generations of leadership, but are extremely humbled that 10% of our team is represented by more than one family member or generation. Visit our Careers page to learn more about our culture and browse open positions.





Our past drives our future As our organization grows, we find value in reflecting on the milestones that have led us to where we are today. Visit our history page to experience an interactive timeline that highlights the people, discoveries and events that have contributed to our success.





Our team culture Each of our team members contributes their own unique personality, perspective and personal set of skills to the organization. Together, we make up a thriving, close-knit, global community that feels more like family than a workforce. Visit our team page to explore testimonials and get a sense for our culture.





Knowledge is power Innovation is the cornerstone of Oil-Dri’s advancement. We have an extensive research and development program that has resulted in many breakthrough products and market applications. Explore our innovation page for a deeper look at how we have created value-added products from specialty minerals.





OUR TEAM IS OUR FAMILY Over the past 75 years, our organization has grown to a team of nearly 800 individuals. Throughout this growth, we have managed to preserve a vibrant, family-oriented atmosphere that attracts high-quality, dedicated teammates. If you are searching for fulfilling work with dedicated, forward-thinking people, we encourage you to explore our career opportunities.

In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
