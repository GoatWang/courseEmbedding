 CLEARWATER, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      MarineMax, Inc. (NYSE:HZO), the nation’s largest recreational boat and
      yacht retailer, today announced results for its third quarter ended June
      30, 2017.
    

      Revenue was $329.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared
      with $345.6 million for the comparable quarter last year. Same-store
      sales decreased 10% following a robust 44% growth comparison in the same
      period a year ago. Due primarily to the strength of product margins and
      a rise in the Company’s traditionally higher margin businesses, gross
      margin increased 290 basis points in the quarter ended June 30, 2017
      over the prior year. The Company’s net income was $14.2 million, or
      $0.57 per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to
      net income of $13.8 million, or $0.56 per diluted share for the
      comparable quarter last year.
    

      Revenue increased 12% to $801.7 million for the nine months ended June
      30, 2017 compared with $714.7 million for the comparable period last
      year. Same-store sales grew approximately 6% on top of 25% growth for
      the comparable period last year. Net income for the nine months ended
      June 30, 2017 was $19.6 million or $0.78 per diluted share, up 13%,
      compared with net income of $17.0 million, or $0.69 per diluted share
      for the comparable period last year.
    

William H. McGill, Jr., Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
      stated, “We are pleased with our team’s ability to drive unit sales
      growth and strong gross margin expansion during the important June
      quarter. Reports of industry softness in larger product categories,
      combined with delayed sales due to unseasonal Northeast weather,
      dampened our overall revenue and therefore earnings in the quarter. We
      believe the revenue impact from these challenges will be made up in the
      future as the underlying trends in the industry are healthy, as
      evidenced by our ability to grow units on a comparable basis and
      meaningfully increase gross margins in the quarter. Our product
      portfolio, new innovative models and customer centric approach continues
      to resonate well with consumers.”
    

      Mr. McGill continued, “We remain confident in our ability to deliver
      industry leading results. Fundamentally, the demand for the boating
      lifestyle remains strong and our long-term outlook for the industry is
      intact. With our capital rich balance sheet, healthy inventory levels,
      premium brands and strong team, we are well positioned to drive earnings
      and cash flows while taking advantage of opportunities that may arise.”
    

2017 Guidance


      Based on current business conditions, retail trends and other factors,
      the Company is updating its annual guidance expectations for fully taxed
      earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.97 to $1.02 for
      fiscal 2017, from $1.14 to $1.24. These expectations do not take into
      account, or give effect for future material acquisitions that may be
      completed by the Company during the fiscal year or other unforeseen
      events.

MarineMax Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results

CLEARWATER, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MarineMax, Inc. (NYSE:HZO), the nation’s largest recreational boat and yacht retailer, today announced results for its third quarter ended June 30, 2017.
Revenue was $329.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared with $345.6 million for the comparable quarter last year. Same-store sales decreased 10% following a robust 44% growth comparison in the same period a year ago. Due primarily to the strength of product margins and a rise in the Company’s traditionally higher margin businesses, gross margin increased 290 basis points in the quarter ended June 30, 2017 over the prior year. The Company’s net income was $14.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $13.8 million, or $0.56 per diluted share for the comparable quarter last year.
Revenue increased 12% to $801.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $714.7 million for the comparable period last year. Same-store sales grew approximately 6% on top of 25% growth for the comparable period last year. Net income for the nine months ended June 30, 2017 was $19.6 million or $0.78 per diluted share, up 13%, compared with net income of $17.0 million, or $0.69 per diluted share for the comparable period last year.
William H. McGill, Jr., Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We are pleased with our team’s ability to drive unit sales growth and strong gross margin expansion during the important June quarter. Reports of industry softness in larger product categories, combined with delayed sales due to unseasonal Northeast weather, dampened our overall revenue and therefore earnings in the quarter. We believe the revenue impact from these challenges will be made up in the future as the underlying trends in the industry are healthy, as evidenced by our ability to grow units on a comparable basis and meaningfully increase gross margins in the quarter. Our product portfolio, new innovative models and customer centric approach continues to resonate well with consumers.”
Mr. McGill continued, “We remain confident in our ability to deliver industry leading results. Fundamentally, the demand for the boating lifestyle remains strong and our long-term outlook for the industry is intact.
