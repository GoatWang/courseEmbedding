Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measure
As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP").  We believe the non-GAAP measures below are useful measures of our core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business and may enable more appropriate comparison to our peers.  These non-GAAP measures should not be a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and may be calculated differently by other companies.  The following schedule reconciles GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

 (1) Gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan investments, net: The gain (loss) on deferred compensation plan investments, which increases (decreases) deferred compensation expense included in operating income, is removed from operating income in the calculation because it is offset by an equal amount in investment income (loss) below net operating income on the income statement, and thus has no impact on net income attributable to the Company. 


 (2) Net operating income, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by taking the Company's net operating income adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains and losses on investments in the deferred compensation plan. 


 (3) Tax provision on net operating income, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure represents the tax provision excluding the impact of investment related activity and is calculated by applying the tax rate from the actual tax provision to net operating income, as adjusted. 


 (4) Net operating income, as adjusted, after tax: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by taking the net operating income, as adjusted, less the tax provision on net operating income, as adjusted. 


 (5) Net operating income, as adjusted after tax per diluted share: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by dividing the net operating income, as adjusted after tax, by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 


 (6) Operating profit margin, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by dividing the net operating income, as adjusted, by total revenue. 




Our management does not promote that investors consider the above non-GAAP financial measures alone, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Throughout this press release, the Company may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to such matters as anticipated operating results, prospects and levels of assets under management, technological developments, economic trends (including interest rates and market volatility), expected transactions and similar matters. The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "should," "hope," "seek," "plan," "intend" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date thereof. While we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, accordingly, our actual results and experiences could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements we make in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our press releases are discussed under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the 2016 Annual Report and include, but are not limited to: the adverse effect from a decline in the securities markets; a decline in the performance of our products; changes in interest rates; changes in national and local economic and political conditions, the  continuing economic uncertainty in various parts of the world; changes in government policy and regulation, including monetary policy; changes in our ability to attract or retain key employees; unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings or investigations of governmental and self-regulatory organizations; and other risks identified from time-to-time in other public documents on file with the SEC.

About Diamond Hill: We are an independent investment management firm with significant employee ownership and $19.4 billion in assets under management as of  December 31, 2016.  We provide investment management services to institutions and individuals through mutual funds, institutional separate accounts, an exchange traded fund, and private investment funds.  Our entire investment team shares the same intrinsic value investment philosophy focused on absolute returns, and our interests are firmly aligned with our clients through significant investment in its strategies.  For more information visit www.diamond-hill.com.
Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measures As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP").  We believe the non-GAAP measures below are useful measures of our core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business, and may enable more appropriate comparison to our peers.  These non-GAAP measures should not be a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and may be calculated differently by other companies.  The following schedule reconciles GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

 (1) Gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan investments, net: The gain (loss) on deferred compensation plan investments which increases (decreases) deferred compensation expense included in operating income is removed from operating income in the calculation because it is offset by an equal amount in investment income (loss) below net operating income on the income statement, and thus has no impact on net income attributable to the Company. 





 (2) Net operating income, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by taking the Company's net operating income adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains and losses on investments in the deferred compensation plan investments. 





 (3) Tax provision on net operating income, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure represents the tax provision excluding the impact of investment related activity and the sale of subsidiary and is calculated by applying the tax rate from the actual tax provision to net operating income, as adjusted. 





 (4) Net operating income, as adjusted after tax: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by taking the net operating income, as adjusted less the tax provision on net operating income, as adjusted. 





 (5) Net operating income, as adjusted after tax per diluted share: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by dividing the net operating income, as adjusted after tax by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 





 (6) Operating profit margin, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by dividing the net operating income, as adjusted by total revenue.

Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. Earnings Rise on AUM, Investment Gains
The investment company enjoyed net inflows of $164 million in 2016, even as many other active managers struggled with record outflows.

Diamond Hill Investment Group full-year results
Diamond Hill experienced net cash inflows of $164 million during 2016, as inflows to its proprietary and sub-advised funds more than offset outflows in its institutional accounts. Combined with investment gains of nearly $2.4 billion, this led the company's AUM to grow to $19.4 billion as of Dec. 31, 2016, up from $16.8 billion at the end of 2015.  Diamond Hill's higher AUM helped to drive investment advisory revenue higher by 13% year over year to $121.6 million. Mutual fund administration revenue, however, declined 12% to $14.5 million, mainly due to Diamond Hill's sale of its Beacon Hill Fund Services business in June 2016. In all, total revenue rose 9% to $136.1 million.
However, net operating income grew only 7%, to $63.1 million, as operating expenses increased 11% to $73 million. The increase in operating expenses was primarily related to higher compensation and mutual fund administration costs.
Investment income was $7.5 billion, up from a loss of $737 million in 2015. These gains and losses can change significantly from one period to another, and market fluctuations can distort the underlying operating performance of the company. As such, Diamond Hill's management focuses more on net operating income after tax, a metric that excludes the impact of investment related activity. In this regard, net operating income after tax rose 10%, to $41.3 million, and increased 9% on a per-share basis to $12.09.





Looking forward
As a primarily equity-focused investment company, Diamond Hill's near-term results will be driven largely by the rise and fall of the stock market. While this can create volatility in its quarterly results, the upward trajectory of the market should serve as a tailwind for Diamond Hill's long-term results.
However, another major trend could serve a headwind: the flow of capital toward passive index investments and away from actively managed funds. Diamond Hill is attempting to combat this trend by steadily reducing its fund fees, which should help to lessen the cost advantages that index funds have over its actively managed products. But Diamond Hill's funds will likely always be higher-priced alternatives to index funds because of the inherent higher cost structures of active equity and fixed-income research.
As such, Diamond Hill's best move is to deliver on its stated goal "to achieve net of fee returns that exceed passive alternatives over time." Such performance would be worthy of higher fees, and it could allow Diamond Hill to grow its assets under management by taking share from other active fund managers, even if the overall industry continues to contract in the years ahead.

Net Inflows, Market Gains Fuel Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. Earnings
Even as a tsunami of investor capital flows to index funds, this active fund manager continues to grow its assets under management.

Diamond Hill Investment Group (NASDAQ:DHIL) reported first-quarter results on April 26. The investment management company is benefiting from a seemingly relentless bull market despite shifting competitive dynamics within its industry.

Data source: Diamond Hill Investment Group Q1 2017 earnings press release.
What happened with Diamond Hill Investment Group this quarter?
Diamond Hill experienced net cash inflows of $167 million, which when combined with market gains of $785 million, helped the firm's assets under management grow to $20.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from $17.4 billion at the end of Q1 2016.

The current bull market has been a boon for Diamond Hill. Image source: Getty Images.

In turn, Diamond Hill's investment advisory fees increased 19% to $31.8 million, despite a 1-basis-point year-over-year decrease in its average advisory fee rate to 0.64%. Mutual fund administration fees, however, fell 12% to $3.3 million due to the sale of its Beacon Hill business, as well as a decline in the net administration fee rate to 0.09% from 0.10% in the year ago period.
Net operating income increased 16%, to $15.8 million, as operating margins held steady at 45%. Investment income was $3.8 million, up from $0.7 million in the prior-year quarter.
Net income, which benefited from a lower effective tax rate, jumped 38% to $12.8 million. Yet because market fluctuations can cause investment income to change significantly from one period to another, Diamond Hill's management focuses more on net operating income after tax, which excludes the impact of investment-related activity. In this regard, adjusted net operating income after tax increased 23%, to $11 million, and 22% on a per-share basis to $3.20.





Looking forward
Diamond Hill continues to buck the trend toward passive investment strategies. It once again enjoyed net inflows in the first quarter, even as much of the industry is seeing capital flow to index funds and away from the type of actively managed funds that Diamond Hill operates. Yet it remains to be seen how long Diamond Hill can continue to fight -- and win -- this uphill battle.
Still, with a proven investing philosophy, a culture focused on fulfilling its fiduciary responsibility to clients, and a track record of success in both the management and marketing of its funds, Diamond Hill should be able to weather the storm better than most. In fact, it could continue to grow its assets under management by taking share from faltering competitors, even if the overall actively managed fund industry shrinks in size in the years ahead.

About Us 





Home > About Us

Founded in 2000, we are an independent investment management firm headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. We provide investment management services to institutions and individuals through mutual funds, separate accounts, exchange traded funds, and private investment funds.
We place our fiduciary duty to our clients at the top of our corporate objectives, and we invest the capital you entrust to us with the same care that we invest our own capital. All of our portfolio managers are significant investors in the same portfolios in which our clients invest, and Diamond Hill employees and affiliates are collectively one of the largest investors in our strategies, ensuring that our interests are aligned with those of our clients.
We have not only grown assets under management in strong markets but have also retained a loyal client base through challenging economic periods. We are committed to achieving excellent long-term results and providing outstanding client service to existing and new clients.
Interview with Our Founder
VIDEO: Ric Dillon, CFA


Our Mission
At Diamond Hill, we serve our clients by providing investment strategies that deliver lasting value through a shared commitment to our intrinsic value-based investment philosophy, long-term perspective, disciplined approach and alignment with our clients’ interest.
Value
We believe market price and intrinsic value are independent in the short-term but tend to converge over time.
Long-Term
We maintain a long-term focus both in investment analysis and management of our business.
Discipline
We invest with discipline to increase potential return and protect capital.
Partnership
We align our interests with those of our clients through significant personal investment in our strategies.
Our Competitive Advantages

As an independent investment management firm, our primary goal and our culture center on achieving the best value-added investment results for our clients.
Our interests are firmly aligned with those of our clients through significant personal investment in our strategies and well-defined compensation practices.
In implementing our investment process, we are rigorous in:

applying our shared intrinsic value-based investment philosophy across all strategies;
adhering to a long-term investment temperament; and
insisting on a margin of safety in every investment we make.

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY 
We believe competitive long-term returns can be achieved by identifying meaningful differences between market price and intrinsic value. We rely on our proprietary Investment Model to arrive at a first approximation of intrinsic value and then further refine our estimate through our independent research and experience.

Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measure
As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP").  We believe the non-GAAP measures below are useful measures of our core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business and may enable more appropriate comparison to our peers.  These non-GAAP measures should not be a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and may be calculated differently by other companies.  The following schedule reconciles GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

 (1) Gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan investments, net: The gain (loss) on deferred compensation plan investments, which increases (decreases) deferred compensation expense included in operating income, is removed from operating income in the calculation because it is offset by an equal amount in investment income (loss) below net operating income on the income statement, and thus has no impact on net income attributable to the Company. 


 (2) Net operating income, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by taking the Company's net operating income adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains and losses on investments in the deferred compensation plan. 


 (3) Tax provision on net operating income, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure represents the tax provision excluding the impact of investment related activity and is calculated by applying the tax rate from the actual tax provision to net operating income, as adjusted. 


 (4) Net operating income, as adjusted, after tax: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by taking the net operating income, as adjusted, less the tax provision on net operating income, as adjusted. 


 (5) Net operating income, as adjusted after tax per diluted share: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by dividing the net operating income, as adjusted after tax, by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 


 (6) Operating profit margin, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by dividing the net operating income, as adjusted, by total revenue. 




Our management does not promote that investors consider the above non-GAAP financial measures alone, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Throughout this press release, the Company may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to such matters as anticipated operating results, prospects and levels of assets under management, technological developments, economic trends (including interest rates and market volatility), expected transactions and similar matters. The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "should," "hope," "seek," "plan," "intend" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date thereof. While we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, accordingly, our actual results and experiences could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the forward-looking statements we make in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our press releases are discussed under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the 2016 Annual Report and include, but are not limited to: the adverse effect from a decline in the securities markets; a decline in the performance of our products; changes in interest rates; changes in national and local economic and political conditions, the  continuing economic uncertainty in various parts of the world; changes in government policy and regulation, including monetary policy; changes in our ability to attract or retain key employees; unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings or investigations of governmental and self-regulatory organizations; and other risks identified from time-to-time in other public documents on file with the SEC.
