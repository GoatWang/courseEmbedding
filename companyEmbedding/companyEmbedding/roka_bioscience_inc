Our focus on food safety
Roka Bioscience is dedicated to delivering the most advanced testing solutions to the Food Safety Industry. We understand the challenges facing manufacturers. Food pathogen outbreaks have had significant negative economic impact, affecting not just the product that must be recalled from the shelves, but also the entire brand. Consumer awareness—and concern—are at all-time high levels. The need for advanced, cost-effective, efficient pathogen detection systems has never been more imminent.
Roka is here to partner with food manufacturers and help them reach the next level of food safety testing. Our proven molecular testing technology delivers accurate, rapid results utilizing the Atlas® System, enabling greater laboratory efficiencies than ever before.
Our current menu of assays includes tests for:

Listeria
Listeria monocytogenes
Salmonella
E. coli
STEC


A changing legal landscape
In January 2011, President Obama signed the Food Safety Modernization Act into law. This ground-breaking piece of legislation gives the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to prevent outbreaks rather than just responding to them. The law requires food facilities to implement and monitor effective measures to prevent contamination, conduct regular hazard analyses, and assess potential safety risks. Under these guidelines, the FDA has mandatory recall authority for all food products.


Food safety facts

Foodborne diseases are a significant public health concern.
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), every year in the United States 48 million people (1 in 6 Americans) get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die from foodborne illnesses.1
The CDC recognizes 31 pathogens known to cause foodborne illness.1
Both Listeria and Salmonella are among the top 5 pathogens contributing to foodborne deaths.1

Speed

The system’s simplified sample and reagent loading procedure minimizes operator hands-on time
Utilizing the system’s high-throughput capacity, a single operator can process and receive results for more than 300 samples in an 8-hour shift, or more than 500 results in 12 hours
Reduced enrichment times provide faster turnaround

Accuracy

Automated process controls help ensure consistency and quality

Liquid level sensing and reagent dispense verification eliminate the risk of pipetting errors that may compromise sample results
Internal control in every reaction ensures the integrity of every sample result


System tracking and barcoding provide full sample-to-result traceability

All samples, fluids, reagents, and ancillary components are barcoded, tracked, and managed within the system
Automated inventory control eliminates the need for manual transcription



Efficiency

Flexible, continuous-access sample loading enables greater workflow customization and laboratory efficiency

Continuous access eliminates the need to batch samples, removes labor bottlenecks, and allows loading and unloading of samples and reagents while the instrument processes assays


Walk-away freedom increases overall lab productivity and efficiency

Full automation, from sample purification to pathogen detection, eliminates the need for manual sample processing
The Atlas System’s “sample-in, result-out” format provides maximum performance with minimal hands-on timeThe system is cost-effective, allowing labs to increase workload without adding resources


Lean processing requires minimal labor

With its greatly reduced operator intervention requirements, the system creates an upstream and downstream workflow advantage
The system requires minimal training, and optimizes the use and efficiency of laboratory resources


Intuitive design makes it easy to use

The system’s touch-screen user interface facilitates error-free operation
External indicators provide real-time status updates
The “all-in-one” design saves valuable bench space, eliminating the need for additional equipment (e.g., heating and cooling blocks, centrifuges, computers, biological safety cabinets)



The Atlas System runs the Atlas E. coli O157:H7 EG2 Detection Assay, the Atlas STEC EG2 Combo Detection Assay, the Atlas Listeria LSP Detection Assay, the Atlas Listeria monocytogenes LmG2 Detection Assay, and the Atlas Salmonella SEN Detection Assay.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

A Fully Automated Sample Purification Process
The major limitation of current nucleic acid amplification assays is the sample processing step which is usually complex, time-consuming, and often can include interfering substances that can inhibit the amplification reaction.

Target Capture is a sample-preparation technology, which concentrates and purifies target nucleic acids before the amplification process. Oligonucleotides, bound to magnetic particles, specifically capture the targeted nucleic acid. Magnetic particles with bound target are then pulled to the side of the tube by a magnet — and potential inhibitory substances are washed away before amplification.
Target Capture Advantages:


Increase in specificity and sensitivity
Virtual elimination of false negatives by washing away inhibitors
Increased sample diversity and specimen types
Allows for large sample volume
Simplifies sample processing with no centrifugation or transfers
Presents a concentrated and purified target for amplification
