Croskey has an extensive background in the signage and graphics industry and most recently served as vice president of Creative Sign Designs in Tampa, Fla. He previously worked at Image International Corp., McNichols Co. and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
Croskey received an MBA from Wake Forest University and a bachelor’s of science in aeronautical/astronautical engineering at Ohio State University.
“I am very excited with Mr. Croskey’s addition to LSI’s executive team,” LSI CEO Dennis Wells said in the announcement. “The world of signage and graphics is changing rapidly and we need smart energetic people working to grow our share in this large addressable market. He and his team will work closely with Shawn Toney, president, LSI Lighting Segment, and John Bagwell, president, LSI Technology Segment, to grow LSI’s position as a leader in image solutions.”
Croskey will replace David McCauley, who served as the leader of the graphics segment for 18 years.
Cincinnati-based LSI uses technology, design and manufacturing to produce efficient, high-quality lighting and graphics products. The company has undergone a shuffling of its top executives in the past year, most notably with new CEO Dennis Wells taking over the role from Bob Ready sooner than originally projected.

Croskey v. BMW
CASE RESULTS DEPEND UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS UNIQUE TO EACH CASE. CASE RESULTS DO NOT GUARANTEE OR PREDICT A SIMILAR RESULT IN ANY FUTURE CASE. 


Detroit jury agrees BMW not liable for lower extremity burns
DETROIT, MI - A unanimous Federal Court jury agreed that BMW NA and BMW AG and its 1992 325i did not have a design defect in the radiator, that there was not a failure to warn and BMW was not responsible for burns to William Croskey. Croskey claimed a design defect caused the radiator to explode and spray boiling hot coolant on his lower extremities causing severe burns and permanent impotence.
The 8-person jury (four men and four women) deliberated for nearly three hours, before rendering their unanimous defense verdict on Friday, February 3, 2006. Plaintiff Croskey had asked the jury to award him $25 million.
The three-year-old case began its first week of trial with a mistrial because of legal issues.
36-year old Croskey alleged the incident occurred on July 5, 2000 in his driveway in Pontiac, Michigan. At the time of the incident, Croskey was attempting to add coolant to the car while the engine was still running. While the hood was open, Croskey stood in front of the engine and leaned over the radiator. It was at that moment that he claimed the radiator neck burst allowing boiling hot coolant to spray him from abdomen to upper thigh. Croskey and his counsel claimed that 1000s of other BMW cars have the same design defect in their radiator water tanks because they were constructed from a plastic material known as PA 6.6 GF 30 HR (a/k/a "Ultramid"). BMW defended the case by proving that the radiator design was state of the art, reasonably safe and used by many other OEMs. BMW also proved that Croskey’s BMW had a long history of cooling system problems including several prior over heat situations and that this incident occurred because Croskey failed to follow the instructions and warnings provided with the car through the owners' manual.
