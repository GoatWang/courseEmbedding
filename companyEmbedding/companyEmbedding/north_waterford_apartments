City - Midland







Halfway between Fort Worth and El Paso, Midland rests just off of I-20, neighboring Odessa. Known for its booming energy industry, Midland also harbors a fierce dedication to high school football, partially inspiring Friday Night Lights.

Midland is home to a variety of museums, including the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum, the Museum of the Southwest, and the Odessa Meteor Crater and Museum. Residents of Midland, often referred to as Midlanders, relish spending time in nature at the nearby Big Bend National Park and the I-20 Wildlife Preserve. There is also a burgeoning arts scene in Midland, punctuated by Midland College’s McCormick Gallery, the Wagner Noel Performing Arts Center, and the Midland-Odessa Symphony and Chorale.

Convenient to Midland International Air and Space Port as well as I-20, getting around from Midland is a breeze.

So I invite you to explore North Waterford apartments below...But Apartment Home Living is about much more than helping you find the right place. It’s also about helping you love your apartment life. Let’s face it, apartment living is AWESOME!

Living in North Waterford apartments only adds to all that “awesomeness.” Attractions, excellent night-life, shopping and dining are found in every nook and cranny of North Waterford.

Or heck...if you have a few days off and are feeling really ambitious, why not take advantage of that apartment living freedom and ROAD TRIP to the lake or the coast? It’s not like you have to get back in time for a second job to pay your mortgage. Right? Living in North Waterford apartments helps you maximize your fun while being really efficient on your time and your cash flow.Speaking of cash flow. Because you’re saving money renting an apartment in North Waterford, you’re freeing up some extra spending money to hit up the mall for that new pair of shoes you’ve been drooling over or that superb surround-sound system to give movie night that true theatrical experience. (Remember to be neighbor considerate!) Or...put that extra time and money into decorating your place the coolest way possible! Consider yourself an artist and your apartment a blank canvas and go to town. By the way, Trey posters are available for just $19.95. Proceeds might go to a good cause. Wink, wink. Nudge, nudge.All the benefits of apartment living let you live how you want to live, play how you want to play and do what you truly want to do. So what are you waiting for?

City - Midland







Halfway between Fort Worth and El Paso, Midland rests just off of I-20, neighboring Odessa. Known for its booming energy industry, Midland also harbors a fierce dedication to high school football, partially inspiring Friday Night Lights.

Midland is home to a variety of museums, including the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum, the Museum of the Southwest, and the Odessa Meteor Crater and Museum. Residents of Midland, often referred to as Midlanders, relish spending time in nature at the nearby Big Bend National Park and the I-20 Wildlife Preserve. There is also a burgeoning arts scene in Midland, punctuated by Midland College’s McCormick Gallery, the Wagner Noel Performing Arts Center, and the Midland-Odessa Symphony and Chorale.

Convenient to Midland International Air and Space Port as well as I-20, getting around from Midland is a breeze.
