Jonathan Product provides products that are sulfate-free, 100% vegan and formulated with purified Essential Water. In addition, Jonathan Product's formulations are void of DEA and MEA, mineral oil, alcohol and colorants whenever feasible, ensuring the most natural products Jonathan Product is able to offer.
