Nicholas J. Stanutz Senior Executive Vice President,
Managing Director of Auto Finance, Commercial Real Estate, and Community Development Lending & Investment











About Nick
Nicholas G. Stanutz oversees the performance of some of Huntington’s more asset-centric businesses, which account for approximately 30 percent of all loans and leases.

Stanutz joined Huntington in 1986, established its Indiana presence as auto finance regional manager, and went on to manage auto finance, home equity, and credit card and consumer collections. In 1998 he began focusing exclusively on expanding Huntington’s auto finance business. Today the business is comprised of more than 3,800 dealers in 17 states and finances more cars than at any other time in Huntington’s 60 years of service to the automotive industry.

Committed to customer and community, Stanutz serves on the American Financial Services Association board and the organization’s vehicle finance committee. He’s a 19-year member and past chairman of the Consumer Bankers Association auto finance committee. Locally, Stanutz serves as treasurer of the Columbus Speech and Hearing Center, in addition to serving on the organization's board of directors. He is a past member of the Central Ohio United Way and Ohio Chamber of Commerce boards.

Stanutz graduated from the University of Wisconsin Graduate School of Banking and holds a bachelor's degree in finance from Indiana University, Bloomington.
