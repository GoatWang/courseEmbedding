You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.

This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Smith's most widely known song is "Because the Night", which was co-written with Bruce Springsteen. The song reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1978.
