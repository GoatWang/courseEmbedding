Stratus Properties Inc. Completes Refinance Of W Austin Property






Business Wire




Jan 11, 2016 8:00 AM EST













 




























































  Stratus Properties Inc. (NASDAQ:STRS) announced today that on January 5, 2016, it completed the refinancing of its W Austin Hotel & Residences and Austin City Limits Live at the Moody Theater mixed-use development in downtown Austin, Texas (the "W Austin Property"). Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company provided a $150 million, ten-year, non-recourse term loan with interest fixed at 5.58 percent and payable monthly based on a 30-year amortization. Stratus' current net investment in the W Austin Property after this financing is approximately $8 million.  As previously reported, on May 12, 2015, Stratus' former partner in the W Austin Property, Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund II ("Canyon"), initiated the buy/sell provisions of the partnership's operating agreement, providing Stratus the opportunity to purchase Canyon's interest in the W Austin Property; the purchase was completed on September 28, 2015. Stratus' purchase of Canyon's interest was based on a total project gross price of approximately $210 million. After considering approximately $22.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by the partnership and acquired by Stratus in its purchase of Canyon's interest, the purchase was effectively based on a net price of approximately $187.2 million.  The trailing 12-month net operating income ("NOI") for the W Austin Property at the time Stratus purchased Canyon's interest was $15.6 million, which equates to a capitalization rate of 8.33%.  In order to ensure that Stratus could timely fulfill its buy/sell purchase obligation pursuant to the partnership's operating agreement, Stratus refinanced the existing Bank of America term loan for the W Austin Property, increasing proceeds from $100.0 million to $130.0 million, and obtained $20.0 million of bridge financing from Comerica Bank, Stratus' primary relationship lender. Stratus concurrently began sourcing long-term non-recourse fixed-rate debt for the W Austin Property, which culminated with the Goldman Sachs refinance.  The pricing of Stratus' purchase of Canyon's interest in the W Austin Property compares favorably to recent third party appraisals and hotel sales in the Austin market. Appraisals obtained by banks in the refinancing process reflected valuations of the W Austin Property of approximately $239 million. After allocating values to the live music and entertainment venue and office and retail space at the W Austin Property (based on the allocation methodology in each bank's appraisal), Stratus' net cost per room was approximately $510,000. The Four Seasons Hotel Austin, built in 1987, was sold in August of 2015 for a reported $677,000 per room.

Project Description

                    Circle C Ranch is a master planned community begun in the 1980s and currently consisting 
                    of more than 3,700 homes with 11,000+ residences, a 500+ acre park, The Lady Bird Johnson 
                    Wildflower Center, an Olympic-size pool, a child development center, two elementary schools, 
                    a fire station, Parkside Village and the Escarpment Village shopping center. As landowner of more than 1,200 
                    acres in Circle C, Stratus negotiated a settlement agreement with the City of Austin in 2002 
                    to entitle the properties for primarily commercial development.
