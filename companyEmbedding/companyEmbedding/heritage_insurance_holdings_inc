Heritage Insurance Holdings is Now Oversold (HRTG)
Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

Heritage Insurance Holdings Enters Oversold Territory
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

How To YieldBoost HRTG From 1.6% To 22.7% Using Options
Shareholders of Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.6% annualized dividend yield can sell the June covered call at the $15 strike and collect the premium based on the 95 cents bid, which annualizes to an additional 21% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 22.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $15 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but HRTG shares would have to advance 2.7% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 9.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Heritage Insurance Holdings Becomes Oversold

Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

HRTG: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 11/15/2016 settlement date, and Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 7.86 "days to cover" versus the median component at 4.41. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

How To YieldBoost HRTG From 1.8% To 13.3% Using Options
Shareholders of Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.8% annualized dividend yield can sell the December covered call at the $15 strike and collect the premium based on the 80 cents bid, which annualizes to an additional 11.5% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 13.3% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $15 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but HRTG shares would have to climb 14.1% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 20.1% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Top Buys by Top Brass: CEO Lucas's $247.9K Bet on HRTG
A company's own top management tend to have the best inside view into the business, so when company officers make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.
