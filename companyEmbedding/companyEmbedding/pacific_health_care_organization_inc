PHCO

Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries we   provide a range of workers’ compensation solutions to employers in   California.  These services include managing and administering Health   Care Organizations and Medical Provider Networks, implementing and   administering Workers’ Compensation Carve-Outs, utilization review,   medical bill review and nurse case management.  We are also preparing to   offer lien representation services.
 


 
Our Subsidiaries
 


Through our two HCO licenses, we offer   injured workers a choice of enrolling in an HCO with a network managed   by primary care providers requiring a referral to specialists or a   second HCO where injured workers do not need any prior authorization to   be seen and treated by specialists.
The two HCO certifications obtained by   Medex cover the entire state of California.   Medical and indemnity   costs associated with workers’ compensation in the state California are   billions of dollars annually.  Our two HCO certified programs have   contracted with over 3,900 individual providers and clinics, as well as   hospitals, pharmacies, rehabilitation centers and other ancillary   services making our HCOs capable of providing comprehensive medical   services throughout this region.  We are continually developing these   networks based upon the nominations of new clients and the approvals of   their claims’ administrators.  Provider credentialing is performed by   Medex.
As discussed above, under the HCO   guidelines, all HCOs are required to pay certain fees.  These   requirements increase the administrative costs of an HCO, although, as a   result of the restructuring of the HCO enrollment fee, such differences   are no longer substantial.
Due to multiple HCO requirements, many   clients opt to use the less complicated MPN even though the client has   less control over the employee’s claim.  The HCO program gives the   client, in most cases, 180 days of medical control in a provider network   within which the client has the ability to direct the claim. The   injured worker may change physicians once, but may not leave the   network.  Whereas the MPN program seems to allow medical control for the   life of the claim, but contains provisions that allow the employer   client’s control of only the initial treatment before the employee can   treat with anyone in the network.  In addition, the MPN statute and   regulations allow the injured worker to dispute treatment decisions,   leading to second and third opinions, and then a review by an   Independent Medical Reviewer, whose decision can end up with the   employer client losing medical control.  A significant number of   employer clients have availed themselves of the MPN.  Others utilize the   provisions of the HCO plus MPN program.
Unlike HCOs, MPNs are not assessed   annual fees and no annual enrollment notice delivery requirements.    MPN’s are only required to provide an enrollment notice at the time the   employee first joins the MPN and a second notice must be delivered to   the employee at the time he suffers a workplace injury.  As a result,   there are fewer administrative costs associated with administering an   MPN program, which allows MPNs to market their services at a lower cost   fees than HCOs.
 




In March 2011 we incorporated Medex   Managed Care, Inc., in the state of Nevada, as a wholly owned subsidiary   of the Company.  In April 2011 MMC took over the responsibilities of   overseeing and managing the utilization review and medical bill review   business previously managed by Medex.
Utilization Review
Utilization review includes     utilization review or utilization management functions that   prospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently review and approve,   modify, delay, or deny, based in whole or in part on medical necessity   to cure and relieve, treatment recommendations by physicians, prior to,   retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of such medical   treatment services pursuant to California Workers’ Compensation law, or   other jurisdictional statutes.
We provide UR to self-insured clients,   insurance companies and public entities.  UR helps to reduce costs for   the payor and determine if the recommended treatment is appropriate.    MMC offers automated review services that can cut the overhead costs of   our client and increase payor savings.  Our UR staff is experienced in   the workers’ compensation industry and dedicated to provide a high   standard of customer service.
Medical Bill Review
Medical bill review   (“MBR”)   refers   to professional analysis of medical provider, services, or equipment   billing to ascertain the proper reimbursement.  Such services include,   but are not limited to, coding review and rebundling, reasonable and   customary review, fee schedule analysis, out-of-network bill review,   pharmacy review, PPO management, and repricing.
In connection with our MBR services, we   provide bill review (cost containment) services to self-insured   employers, insurance companies and the public sector to help reduce   medical expenses paid by our customers.  In providing these services we   provide network savings on top of State Fee Schedule savings allowing   top provider networks to achieve savings.
We offer our clients with quick   turnaround, state of the art software and the expertise of our bill   review staff.  We are committed to service and believe the reputation of   our staff sets us apart from our competition.
 




On February 13, 2012 we incorporated Medex Medical Management, Inc.   (“MMM”) in the state of Nevada, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the   Company.  MMM will be responsible for overseeing and managing nurse case   management (“NCM”) services previously managed by our subsidiary Medex.
Nurse Case Management 
Nurse case management is a collaborative process that assesses,   plans, implements, coordinates, monitors, and evaluates the options and   services required to meet an injured worker’s health needs.  Our nurse   case managers use communication and available resources to promote   quality, cost-effective outcomes with the goal of returning the injured   worker to gainful employment and maximum medical improvement as soon as   medically appropriate.
Our credentialed registered nurses have expertise in various clinical   areas and extensive backgrounds in workers’ compensation.  This   combination allows our nurses the opportunity to facilitate the medical   treatment while understanding the nuances of workers’ compensation up to   and including litigation.  By providing these services, we contribute   to effective delivery of medical treatment assuring the injured worker   receives quality treatment in a timely and appropriate manner to return   the worker to gainful employment.
 



In June 2010 we acquired Arissa Managed Care, Inc., as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to sell services offered by MEDEX, IRC or any other subsidiary of the Company.  In February 2012 Arissa changed its name to MEDEX Legal Support, Inc. and plans to offer to its customers all aspects of lien defense from negotiation to lien litigation, including filing petitions for reconsideration.  MLS plans to provide its clients a broad comprehensive lien representation program, while settling liens resulting in high potential savings for its clients. Subsequently, the previous owners of Arissa were allowed to again utilize the Arissa name in conducting their own business.
 




In 2001, we incorporated Workers Compensation Assistance, Inc., (now   known as Industrial Resolutions Coalition, Inc.), as a wholly-owned   subsidiary with the intent of pursuing other opportunities in the   workers’ compensation field.  Toward the end of 2007, we identified a   business opportunity within the workers’ compensation field that we have   begun to pursue.  Through IRC, we seek to create legal agreements for   the implementation of Workers’ Compensation Carve-Outs for California   employers with collective bargaining units, and the administration of   such programs within the statutory and regulatory requirements.
The California legislature permits employers and employees to engage   in collective bargaining over alternative systems to resolve disputes in   the workers’ compensation context.   These systems are called   carve-outs because the employers and employees covered by such   collective bargaining agreements are carved out from the state workers’   compensation system.  The goals of a carve-out include:

improving safety programs and having fewer injury and illness claims;


increasing access to quality medical providers and medical evaluators;


lowering costs of medical care;


reducing disputes;


improving collaboration between unions and employers;


increasing satisfaction of all parties; and


providing the opportunity for continuous improvement by renegotiating the terms of the carve-out on an as-needed basis.

About PHCO

Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc., through its subsidiaries, engages in managing and administering health care organizations (HCOs) and managed provider networks in the state of California. The HCOs are networks of medical providers established to serve the workers’ compensation industry.

The company was formerly known as Clear Air, Inc. and changed its name to Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc. in January 2001. Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc. was incorporated in 1970 and is based in Newport Beach, California.

					Full Description



Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc., incorporated on April 17, 1970, is a specialty workers' compensation managed care company. The Company provides a range of services for self-administered employers, insurers, third party administrators, municipalities and others in the state of California. The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides workers' compensation cost containment services, including healthcare organizations (HCOs), medical provider networks (MPNs), HCO + MPN, workers' compensation carve-outs, utilization review (UR), medical bill review (MBR), nurse case management (NCM), network access and claims repricing, lien representation services and Medicare Set Aside (MSA). The Company's subsidiaries include Medex Healthcare, Inc. (Medex), Industrial Resolutions Coalition, Inc. (IRC), Medex Managed Care, Inc. (MMC), Medex Medical Management, Inc. (MMM) and Medex Legal Support, Inc., (MLS). Through Medex, the Company manages and administers healthcare organizations and medical provider networks in the state of California. Through IRC, the Company participates in the business of creating legal agreements for the implementation and administration of workers' compensation carve-outs for California employers. Through MMC, the Company oversees and manages the Company's utilization review and managed bill review business. Through MMM, the Company oversees and manages its nurse case management services. Through MLS, it offers lien representation and Medicare Set Aside services to its clients from negotiation to litigation, including filing petitions for reconsideration.The HCOs are networks of healthcare professionals specializing in the treatment of workplace injuries and in back-to-work rehabilitation and training. The HCO program gives the employer client approximately 180 days of medical control in a provider network, within which the employer client has the ability to direct the claim. The MPN is a network of healthcare professionals. Under an MPN program the employer client dictates, which physician the injured employee will see for the initial visit. Thereafter, the employee can choose to treat with any physician within the MPN network. The HCO + MPN is a combination of the HCO and MPN programs. Under HCO + MPN plan model, an employer can enroll its employees in the HCO program, and then prior to the expiration of the 90 day or 180 day treatment period under the HCO program, the employer can enroll the employee into the MPN program.The Company's UR includes utilization review or utilization management functions that prospectively, retrospectively or concurrently review and approve, modify, delay or deny, based in whole or in part on medical necessity to cure and relieve, treatment recommendations by physicians, prior to, retrospectively or concurrently with the provision of such medical treatment services pursuant to California workers' compensation law, or other jurisdictional statutes. The Company provides UR to self-insured clients, insurance companies and public entities through MMC. MBR refers to professional analysis of medical provider, services or equipment billing to ascertain the proper reimbursement. Such services include, coding review and rebundling, customary and reasonableness review, fee schedule analysis, out-of-network bill review, pharmacy review, preferred provider organization (PPO) management and repricing. NCM is a collaborative process that assesses plans, implements, coordinates, monitors and evaluates the options and services required to meet an injured worker's health needs. The Company offers MSA services for Workers' Compensation claims, which is a financial agreement that allocates a portion of a workers' compensation settlement to pay for future medical services related to the worker related injury, illness or disease.

Pacific Health Care Signals To The Market: Our Shares Are Undervalued - Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc. (OTCMKTS:PFHO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Pacific Health Care Signals To The Market: Our Shares Are UndervaluedJun. 1.15 | About: Pacific Health (PFHO) The Specialist Long/short equity, special situations, growth at reasonable price, contrarianFollow me on TwitterSummaryPFHO’s stock buyback plan was set to expire Monday June 1.Shares of the stock were selling off on Friday possibly in anticipation.PFHO in after hours Friday announced it has extended its stock buyback program an additional six months.Normally when I see an 8K or a press release on a Friday in after hours for a stock I am long I cringe, expecting nothing but the worst. However, when Pacific Health Care Organization (OTCQB:PFHO) did so this Friday my anxiety turned instead to excitement.
PFHO sold off on Friday as much as 14.8% on five times the average volume. I suspect the reason for this was that previously announced stock buyback program was set to expire on Monday leaving investors none too pleased. Then, in after hours, a press release (followed by a minor correction) came announcing that the buyback program has been extended an additional six months.
According to the 10K and 10Q, PFHO through its third-party broker (and at the broker's discretion) bought back 2,028 shares at an average price of $37.28 last December, 270 shares at an average price of $37.81 in Q1, and an additional 2,422 shares at an average price of $32.84 so far during Q2 for a running total of 4,710 shares.
4,710 shares may not seem like a lot, but the total outstanding shares are less than 800k and the float is around 260k according to otcmarkets.com. There is currently $330,881 left authorized in the buyback program. At the current share price at the time of this writing of $33.75 would represent an about an additional 9,800 shares or 1.2% of the outstanding total or 3.8% of the float which seems rather sizable at least to me.
I also finding it interesting that right at the start of the quarter, CEO Tom Kubota bought 300 shares in the open market at $30.99. All of this circumstantial evidence gives me more confidence in PFHO with details mentioned in my last article entitled Why Pacific Health Care's Q1 And Outlook Are Even Better Than You Think.
On a side note, PFHO's website now mentions something I found interesting. On the "about" section it states,


"Our partnership with PHCO afforded us the opportunity to build Decision UR Software as its own brand. In addition, we were able to secure new blue chip customers, which positioned the company at a new level. Coupled with expanding our competencies into the product lifecycle management area, we have found the support of PHCO to have been very successful for the company.
Dr. Lester Sacks CEO of DecisionUR, Ltd."

DecisionUR Software is a California company recently acquired by Patriot National (NYSE:PN). PN is a Florida-based workers compensation company, like PFHO, and seems to be on an acquisition binge since going public in January of this year. It has announced the acquisition of nine companies in the last four months alone. Being public likely makes it cheaper and easier to make acquisitions especially when a company has a liquid public stock to back it up.
Could PFHO be next on the menu for PN? I've long thought the only logical end game for PFHO is to be acquired for a premium given how illiquid the stock often is at times. It's entirely speculative on my part, but I have to wonder with PN's subsidiary giving such high accolades to PFHO if maybe PN would want to just acquire the entire company and make it acquisition number 10. It certainly could explain the desire of PFHO to keep buying its own stock which likely would result in a higher buyout offer per remaining share.
