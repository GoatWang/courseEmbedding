About Sickle Cell DiseaseSCD is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fıbrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with SCD suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crisis, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crisis causes excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. SCD is an orphan disease in the U.S affecting approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S and millions worldwide with significant unmet medical needs.

TORRANCE, Calif., January 25, 2016 – Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc.

“We started 2016 with renewed focus, continuing to advance our work on our sickle cell program,” said Niihara. “In 2015 we raised over $7 million with the support of loyal shareholders to bring our total funds raised to more than $50 million. I would like to thank our loyal shareholders now in excess of 400 and express gratitude to our management team and new board members as we move forward.”
Niihara is the principal inventor of the patented L-glutamine therapy for treatment of sickle cell disease, has been involved in patient care and research for sickle cell disease during most of his career and is a widely published author in the area of sickle cell disease. Dr. Niihara is board-certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine/Medical Oncology and the American Board of Internal Medicine/Hematology. He is licensed to practice medicine in both the U.S. and Japan. Dr. Niihara is a Professor of Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He received his B.A. in Religion from Loma Linda University in 1982 and obtained his MD degree from the Loma Linda University School of Medicine in 1986 and received his MPH from Harvard School of Public Health in 2006.
About Emmaus Life Sciences

The Company’s research on SCD was initiated by Dr. Niihara at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.

For more information, please visit www.emmauslifesciences.com.
About Sickle Cell Disease
SCD is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fıbrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with SCD suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crisis, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crisis causes excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to organ damage, stroke, pulmonary complications, skin ulceration, infection and a variety of other adverse outcomes. SCD is an orphan disease in the U.S affecting approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S and millions worldwide with significant unmet medical needs.
 Forward-Looking Statements

Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from current expectations. Additional risks and uncertainties are described in reports filed by Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Emmaus is providing this information as of the date of this press release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

These statements can be identified by introductory words such as "expects," "plan," "believes," "will," "achieve," "anticipate," "would," "should," "subject to" or words of similar meaning, and by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements frequently are used in discussing potential product applications, potential collaborations, product development activities, clinical studies, regulatory submissions and approvals, and similar operating matters. Many factors may cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements, including inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of risks and uncertainties, some of which are known and others of which are not. Known risks and uncertainties include those identified from time to time in the reports filed by Generex with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which should be considered together with any forward-looking statement. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future results or events, and one should avoid placing undue reliance on such statements. Generex undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Generex claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements that is contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170125005386/en/MULTIMEDIA AVAILABLE:http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170125005386/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBannon convinced Jeff Sessions to endorse Trump, and Sessions worried his career in the Republican Party might end because of itBusiness InsiderDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredJennifer Lopez Bikes Around NYC With Alex Rodriguez: 'There's No Place Like Home'Entertainment TonightAdrian Beltre ejected for hilarious antics in on-deck circleBig League StewMelania Trump’s Floral Dress Is One of Her Prettiest Style Choices YetUs WeeklyEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsored“Game of Thrones” just teased the first meeting of Dany and Jon, and omfgHello GigglesKristin Beck, transgender Navy SEAL hero: 'Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy'Business InsiderHighest ranking retired transgender officer slams new plan: I think Trump is ‘being influenced by Pence’Business InsiderWomen Everywhere Should Carry This Tiny DeviceSiren SongSponsoredPhil Mickelson trash-talked Jordan Spieth at the Open Championship — and Phil is going to have to eat his wordsBusiness InsiderAmazon’s Echo rivaled by Xiaomi and Facebook: rptYahoo Finance VideoWhy the world's biggest search engine has to pay for traffic to its siteYahoo FinanceZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredMcCain slams Trump's transgender military ban, says it's why 'major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter'Business InsiderAP Exclusive: Boy Scouts chief expected a fiery Trump speechAssociated PressUS parents are pulling their children out of Boy Scouts over Donald Trump's 'drunk stepdad' speechKashco: You just can't take him anywhere.Join the Conversation1 / 57k

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.
