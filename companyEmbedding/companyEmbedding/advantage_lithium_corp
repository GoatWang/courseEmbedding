Advantage Lithium adds Second Drill Rig at Cauchari JV Project, Argentina

Second rig will fast-track the exploration and development program 
Vancouver, British Columbia, July 10th , 2017 – Advantage Lithium Corp. (the “Company" or “Advantage Lithium”) (TSXV: AAL; OTCQX: AVLIF) is pleased to announce that a second rotary drill rig has been mobilized and has commenced drilling at the Company’s lithium property located in the Cauchari Salar of Jujuy province in NW Argentina.
Cauchari News Update

A second drill rig has been added to speed up the exploration program. Drilling commenced on hole CAU09 in the SE target area1, 2 km southwest of drill hole CAU10 (Figure 1).
Like CAU10 this hole is located near the property boundary with the Lithium Americas Corp. large lithium resource2 (Figure 2) to extend the existing Cauchari JV resource to greater depth.
Hole CAU10 has now reached a final depth of 429 m. The hole will be widened to install well filters and casing then sampled for brine.
The five planned rotary holes will be installed as test production wells to allow pump testing at potential production flow rates. These wells could be used for future production, reducing future infrastructure requirements.

David Sidoo, CEO of Advantage Lithium, commented, “The second drill rig will fast track the development program on our Cauchari project. Our exploration team, headed by Miguel Peral, is doing an excellent job of advancing this drill program. We are focused on expanding the existing resource at the project and testing a large exploration target. As such the drill holes in our program are designed to test the exploration target at significantly greater depths than previous drilling. This very exciting project is in the heart of the lithium triangle, between established lithium producer Orocobre and the Cauchari development project of Lithium Americas-SQM and represents one of the best undeveloped lithium brine opportunities in South America. At this time lithium assay results are expected to be available in late August.” 
Drilling Observations 
Drilling in CAU10 intersected intervals of sand, silt and clay within the thick salt sequence intersected in previous Cauchari drilling in 2011. Hole CAU09 (Figure 1) to date has intersected a mixture of sand and clay intervals to a depth of 68 m.
Holes CAU09 and CAU10 are being drilled though the existing Cauchari resource area in the SE of the project. This area is immediately underlain by the SE area of the exploration target (which consists of both SE and NW areas – see Figure 1). This large exploration target1 has been defined with a range of 125 to 1,855 million cubic metres of brine at between 260 and 600 mg/l lithium and 2,500 to 5,350 mg/l potassium for the lower and upper ranges1 respectively; this represents an in situ range of contained product of between 0.25 to 5.6 mt of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) and 0.9 to 19 mt of potash (KCl).
Drilling is being conducted near the eastern property boundary of the Lithium Americas Corp. resource, where the highest lithium grades in that project are presented in public announcements.
Drilling Schedule
The rotary drilling sequence is as follows (refer to Figure 1 for locations):

Complete CAU10
Complete CAU09
Rig returns to complete CAU07 (upper portion previously cased and cemented)
Drill CAU08
Drill CAU11

Having successfully completed hole CAU10 to 429m (one of the deepest holes drilled in the Cauchari basin), down-the-hole geophysical profiling will be correlated with lithological logs to provide the basis for filter installation and brine sampling.
The Cauchari exploration program consists of a number of phases of work to provide information for an updated resource estimate and as inputs for the planned scoping study. These are as follows:

Rotary drilling and well installation
Brine sampling
Diamond drilling to take core samples for porosity testing and install monitoring wells
Laboratory analysis of brine samples
Laboratory measurements of porosity samples

Advantage plans to mobilise a diamond drill rig to the project shortly, to install monitoring wells for the pump test wells. This will see three rigs operating on the project.

An exploration target is not a mineral resource. The potential quantity and grade of the exploration target is conceptual in nature, and there has been insufficient exploration to define a Mineral Resource in the volume where the Exploration Target is outlined. It is uncertain if further exploration drilling will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource in this volume.
Immediately between the NW and SE exploration targets properties are held by Lithium Americas Corp. in Joint Venture with major lithium producer SQM. This project has an announced resource of 11.75 mt of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent at an average grade of 585 mg/l (Lithium Americas Corp NI 43 – 101 Technical Report Updated Feasibility Study Reserve Estimation and Lithium Carbonate Production at the Cauchari-Olaroz Salars, Jujuy Province, Argentina – March 29, 2017).

The technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved on behalf of the company by Murray Brooker, MAIG, RPGEO, a “Qualified Person” as defined in NI 43-101.

Advantage Lithium Corp. Expands Land Holdings in Antofalla Salar, Argentina
Jun 19 17
Advantage Lithium Corp. reported the staking of a new property in Catamarca province, Argentina to add to existing prospective land holdings in the Antofalla Salar located in the provinces of Catamarca and Salta, Argentina. Covering approximately 3,000 hectares (ha), this new property, known as Antofallita XX, is strategically located adjacent to properties held by global lithium major Albemarle. In September 2016 Albemarle announced an agreement with Bolland Minera SA (Boland) for an exclusive exploration and acquisition agreement to acquire their holdings in the Antofalla Salar. Bolland and partners had drilled over 56 boreholes and had substantially advanced the property to the resource definition stage. The company's total land holdings in the Antofalla Salar are now 13,000 hectares with 10,000 hectares located in Salta Province and 3,000 hectares in Catamarca Province. The company considers Antofallita XX of importance for its geological setting beside a prominent, deep-seated 'suture' zone of regional fracturing along which numerous hot springs are developed, that could have deposited lithium in the property. Environmental permitting procedures have been initiated with the objective of obtaining approval for a proposed drill program.

Notes:

An exploration target is not a mineral resource. The potential quantity and grade of the exploration target is conceptual in nature, and there has been insufficient exploration to define a Mineral Resource in the volume where the Exploration Target is outlined. It is uncertain if further exploration drilling will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource in this volume.
About Orocobre Limited 
Orocobre Limited is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange (ASX:ORE) (TSX:ORL), and is building a substantial Argentinian-based industrial chemicals and minerals company through the construction and operation of its portfolio of lithium, potash and boron projects and facilities in the Puna region of northern Argentina. The Company has built, in partnership with Toyota Tsusho Corporation and JEMSE, the first large-scale, greenfield brine based lithium project in approximately 20 years at the Salar de Olaroz with planned production of 17,500 tonnes per annum of low-cost lithium carbonate. 
The Olaroz Lithium Facility has a low environmental footprint because of the following aspects of the process:

The process is designed to have a high processing recovery of lithium. With its low unit costs, the process will result in low cut-off grades, which will maximise resource recovery.
The process route is designed with a zero liquid discharge design. All waste products are stored in permanent impoundments (the lined evaporation ponds). At the end of the project life the ponds will be capped and returned to a similar profile following soil placement and planting of original vegetation types.
Brine is extracted from wells with minimum impact on freshwater resources outside the salar. Because the lithium is in sedimentary aquifers with relatively low permeability, drawdowns are limited to the salar itself. This is different from halite hosted deposits such as Salar de Atacama, Salar de Hombre Muerto and Salar de Rincon where the halite bodies have very high near surface permeability and the drawdown cones can impact on water resources around the Salar affecting the local environment.
Energy used to concentrate the lithium in the brine is solar energy. The carbon footprint is lower than other processes.
The technology developed has a very low maximum fresh water consumption of <20 l/s, which is low by industry standards. This fresh water is produced by reverse osmosis from non-potable brackish water.
Sales de Jujuy S.A. is also committed to the ten principles of the sustainable development framework as developed by The International Council on Mining and Metals. The company has an active and well-funded "Shared Value" program aimed at the long term development of the local people.
The Company continues to follow the community and shared value policy to successfully work with suppliers and the employment bureau to focus on the hiring of local people from the communities of Olaroz, Huancar, Puesto Sey, Pastos Chicos, Catua, Susques, Jama, El Toro, Coranzulí, San Juan and Abrapampa. The project implementation is through EPCM (Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management) with a high proportion of local involvement through construction and supply contracts and local employment. The community and shared value policy continues to be a key success factor, training local people under the supervision of high quality experienced professionals. 
The Company also wholly-owns Borax Argentina, an important regional borate producer.

Phase Two drilling is planned for later in 2017 and will comprise a further twelve holes leading to a scoping study by early 2018. Advantage Lithium is increasing its interest in the project from the current 50% to 75% through the expenditure of US$5m or completing a Feasibility Study.  Orocobre (ASX:ORE; TSX:ORL) holds the remaining interest.
Cauchari News Highlights

Phase One drilling: a five hole rotary drill program scheduled to begin during the week commencing May 1, 2017.
Phase Two drilling: A follow-up, twelve hole diamond drill program to commence later in 2017.
Drilling will focus on (a) potential extensions of the existing inferred resource at Cauchari and (b) exploration where no previous drilling has been conducted. A large exploration target1 has been defined with a range of 125 to 1,855 million cubic meters of brine at between 260 and 600mg/l lithium and 2,500 to 5,350mg/l potassium for the lower and upper ranges1 respectively; this represents an in situ range of contained product of between 0.25 to 5.6mt of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) and 0.9 to 19mt of potash (KCl). 
David Sidoo, CEO of Advantage Lithium, commented, "In line with our aggressive development timeline, we are commencing work at our flagship Argentina project of Cauchari, just weeks after completing the transaction with our partner, Orocobre. We will be focusing on expanding the existing resource at the project where a large exploration target has been projected. We have engaged Andina Perforaciones, one of Argentina's leading drilling contractors, to undertake the initial phase of what will ultimately be a 17 hole program."
Cauchari Project Information

Existing Inferred Resource: Host to an inferred resource containing an estimated 230 million cubic metres of brine at ~380 mg/l Li and 3,700 mg/l K. This is equivalent to 470,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate (~88,000 tonnes lithium metal) and 1.62 million tonnes of potash (KCl – equivalent to ~840,000 tonnes of potassium).
Near-Surface. This initial resource estimate is based on five shallow diamond drill holes to an average depth of 50-170m and open to depth.
Exploration Potential. An exploration target has been defined in the NW blocks of the JV property, in addition to that beneath the original resource estimate in the SE property blocks. The combined exploration target in the Cauchari JV properties both west and east of properties held by Lithium Americas Corp. is defined with a range of 125 to 1,855 million cubic meters of brine at between 260 and 600mg/l lithium and 2,500 to 5,350mg/l potassium for the lower and upper ranges1 for 0.25 to 5.6mt of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) for the lower and upper ranges respectively.
Close Proximity to Orocobre's Lithium Facility. Proximity to Orocobre's Olaroz operation and similarity in brine chemistry provides options for future production alternatives.
Program Details
The initial, Phase 1 drill program scheduled to start next week consists of five rotary drill holes targeting the north-west (NW) and south-east (SE) blocks of the property with a surface area of ~5,500 hectares These will be deep holes to approximately 400m below the salar surface, with the objective of (1) probing for extensions laterally and to depth below the existing inferred mineral resource in the SE sector and (2) opening a new front in the NW sector which the company believes to be prospective for extensions of lithium-bearing brine below the Archibarca alluvial fan. 
Later in 2017, a complementary 12-hole diamond drill (DDH) program will be initiated to provide core for aquifer parameter tests and to also install monitoring holes for pump tests on the primary rotary holes. Additional rotary and/or diamond drill holes will be added as justified by initial results as we proceed towards engineering studies.
Specialized packer instrumentation will be used to collect brine samples for analysis under strict QA/QC protocols monitored by a Qualified Person as required by NI43-101 guidelines. In-hole geophysical profiling and geological logging will provide the basis for determining the most promising aquifer zones for packer tests.
Considerable technical and operating skill is required to successfully complete exploration and brine pumping wells in the unconsolidated sedimentary sequences of the salars and to do so at 4,000m above sea level in a rigorous climatic region with sub-zero winter temperatures. The company is therefore most pleased to have signed a contract and to be working with Andina Perforaciones who have multiple years of practical experience in Cauchari and other salars of NW Argentina. Together with the Company's technical staff and supporting community relations team, the company expects to complete the Phase 1 work program by year-end 2017.
(1) An exploration target is not a mineral resource. The potential quantity and grade of the exploration target is conceptual in nature, and there has been insufficient exploration to define a Mineral Resource in the volume where the Exploration Target is outlined. It is uncertain if further exploration drilling will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource in this volume.
The technical information in this news release has reviewed and approved on behalf of the company by Murray Brooker, MAIG, RPGEO, a "Qualified Person" as defined in NI 43-101.

Advantage Lithium – Building an International Lithium Empire: Nevada, Mexico and Argentina



Overview
Advantage Lithium Corp. (TSXV:AAL; OTCQX:AVLIF) is a Vancouver based resource company focused on the strategic acquisition, exploration and development of lithium properties. With a goal of growing through acquisition as well as through the drill bit, the company is quickly building a global lithium empire with strategic exploration projects within the epicenters of three of the world’s lithium hotspots: Nevada, Mexico and Argentina.
In Nevada, Advantage Lithium has partnered with Nevada Sunrise (TSXV:NEV) on a portfolio of five lithium brine projects in the Clayton Valley and Lida Valley regions. Clayton Valley is home to North America’s only lithium brine operation, Albemarle’s Silver Peak mine. Four of these projects are drill-ready, having completed Nevada’s complex permitting process. Advantage Lithium’s access to water rights make the company a standout from its peers within Nevada’s lithium triangle where water rights have been over-appropriated.
In Mexico, the company has partnered with Radius Gold Inc. (TSXV:RDU) in a portfolio of four lithium brine exploration projects located in Mexico. These properties are located in large, closed basins in geological settings analogous with the Clayton Valley basin.
Advantage Lithium’s latest portfolio edition is the Stella Marys project in the province of Salta, within Argentina’s Lithium Triangle. Salta is ranked by Fraser Institute as one of the most favorable jurisdictions in Central and South America for exploration. The region is home to two producing lithium mines—Orocobre’s Olaroz and FMC’s Salar de Hombre Muerto.
Advantage Lithium says it’s ready to do the real work of exploring and developing at its JV lithium properties, and management has a long-term goal of taking the company to producer status. A six-hole program is planned for Q3 2016 at the company’s flagship Clayton NE project.
“With a drill program soon to start at our Clayton NE project in Nevada, a recent agreement to acquire four exciting early-stage projects in Mexico and now, this more advanced project next to Orocobre’s large and shallow resource at Salar de Salinas Grandes, we are closer to fulfilling our goal as a leading junior in the lithium space,” commented David Sidoo, President and CEO of Advantage Lithium.
The company is led by a group of award-winning company builders with a track record of success in creating maximum shareholder value, including Fission Uranium Founder and CEO Dev Randhawa; American Oil & Gas Founder and significant shareholder David Sidoo; and Fission Uranium President, COO and Chief Geologist Ross McElroy.
In August 2016, Advantage Lithium announced the closing of a financing with gross proceeds of $4.025 million and another round of financing was announced in early September for up to an additional $5.04 million.
Investment Highlights 

5 lithium brine projects (4 drill-ready) in the Clayton Valley and Lida Valley region.
Proximal to North America’s only producing lithium brine operation—Albermarle’s Silver Peak mine; Clayton NE border only 110 meters from several Silver Peak production wells.
Drilling at Clayton NE to begin in Q3 2016.
Brine deposits typically have lower exploration and operating costs than hard rock deposits.
Advantage Lithium JV is the only lithium exploration company with access to water rights in the Clayton Valley basin where the state of Nevada has over-appropriated water rights.
Four lithium brine exploration projects in mining-friendly Mexico in large, salar closed basins in geological settings analogous to the Clayton Valley basin.
Stella Marys project immediately adjacent to Orocobre’s large, shallow depth, inferred resource in Argentina’s Lithium Triangle.
Award-winning management team of successful company builders.
Advantage Lithium is now a Tier One company. 

Key Properties: Clayton Valley and Lida Valley, Nevada
 Under its earn-in agreement with Nevada Sunrise, Advantage Lithium has the option to acquire a 70 percent stake in three of the projects and a 50 percent stake in the remaining two projects.

Advantage Lithium also has the right to earn 100 percent of the Nevada Water Right Permit 44411, held by Nevada Sunrise. Water rights are a prerequisite to success for any company in Nevada planning to bring a lithium brine project through development and into production.
Flagship Project: Clayton NE
The Clayton NE property covers 1,000 acres of land in Nevada’s Clayton Valley and is contiguous to the eastern boundary of Albemarle’s Silver Peak mine. Several of the lithium brine production wells at Silver Peak are situated within 110 meters west of the Clayton NE project’s claim boundary.
Historical data on the property includes drill-hole CV-5 which was part of a regional drill program conducted by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1977. The hole was drilled to a depth of 479 feet and encountered lithium values in ground water ranging from 24 ppm to 110 ppm, averaging 69.3 ppm for a group of 11 samples, and averaging 65.75 ppm for another group of 12 samples.

Advantage Lithium believes additional aquifers potentially hosting brines of similar or better contents of lithium could be intersected by deeper drilling. In Q3 2016, the company plans to commence a 6-hole drill program at Clayton NE targeting the Silver Peak border.
Jackson Wash
 The Jackson Wash lithium project covers 3,320 acres in Nevada’s Lida Valley Basin located 30 kilometers southeast of the Silver Peak mine of Clayton Valley. The under-explored Lida Valley is analogous in sedimentary formations and underlying structures to Clayton Valley.
In 2011, historical exploration conducted on the property included sampling and geological surveying. Sampling at six locations returned lithium values ranging from 97.3 ppm lithium to 117.0 ppm lithium. A detailed gravity survey and two CSAMT lines surveyed by a previous operator were interpreted as a layered sequence of unconsolidated, saturated alluvial sediments filling a deep basin beneath the valley floor.

Advantage Lithium believes the property has the potential to host a reservoir of lithium brine within an outlined gravity low. The company has planned a three to four-hole drill program to test specific structural and stratigraphic targets believed prospective for lithium brine deposits. In February 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) granted a drill permit for up to 10 holes over two years.
Gemini
 The Gemini lithium project covers 4,950 acres in the Lida Valley Basin and is located 40 kilometers southeast of the Clayton Valley basin. Between 2012 to 2013, a University of Texas geological research team conducted gravity surveys in the Lida Valley. The resulted indicate strong gravity lows within two faulted sub-basins (Gemini West and Gemini East) approximately 7 kilometers apart and hundreds of meters deep.
In early 2016, results from two moving-loop TDEM surveys carried out on the Gemini property by Nevada Sunrise detected a conductive layer 150 meters to 250 meters deep which appears to cover most of Gemini West and Gemini East sub-basins. Several isolated strong conductive zones were interpreted at depths from 400 meters to 600 meters indicating the potential for lithium-rich brine within the sub-basins.

The BLM has granted permits for 10 exploration drill holes at Gemini to test the sub-basins for lithium-bearing brines.
Neptune
 The Neptune lithium project covers 6,320 acres in the southwest Clayton Valley basin and is located about 15 kilometers to the north of Silver Peaks in an active area for lithium mining and exploration. Historical geophysical data indicates the property has the potential to host lithium brines in subterranean aquifers.
The BLM has permitted 10 drill holes at Neptune. Nevada Sunrise has completed two drill holes on the property to date. In the first hole, sampling from the intersected strata contained lithium-bearing sediments that averaged 156 ppm lithium over 65.5 meters from 392.7 meters to the end of hole at 457.2 meters, reaching a peak value of 217 ppm lithium. In addition, biogeochemical data collected near the drill holes confirmed anomalous lithium concentrations ranging from 11 ppm up to 35 ppm.

Advantage Lithium is planning a third drill hole up to 2,000 meters deep and approximately 1.6 kilometers east of the first hole. A 2016 geophysical survey interpreted this area to be a potential trap where denser, lithium-bearing brines could migrate and pool.
Aquarius
The Aquarius lithium project covers 1,660 acres in the central Clayton Valley basin, approximately 5 kilometers southwest of the Silver Peak mine.
In March 2016, Nevada Sunrise conducted a TDEM geophysical survey which detected conductive horizons at depths ranging between 250 meters to 450 meters. Advantage Lithium is preparing to submit a permit application to the BLM for a drill program to test for lithium brines at Aquarius.

Key Properties: Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico 
 In early September 2016, Advantage Lithium acquired an option to earn up to a 70 percent interest in four lithium brine exploration projects covering a total of 37,000 hectares in the state of Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico.

The Mexico JV projects are located in large, closed basins with salar targets and surface-level lithium in geological settings analogous to the Clayton Valley basin. Geothermal hotsprings have been observed at the La Union and Viesca salars.
The region is underexplored, yet historic work by the Mexican Geologic Survey conducted in 1982 included drill hole at La Union which returned a brine sample of 283 ppm lithium and subsurface highly saline aquifers were also described in the historic data. Surface sampling conducted by Radius Gold returned numerous anomalous lithium results including 189ppm lithium at La Viesca.
Key Properties: Salta Province, Argentina
 The Stella Marys project covers 1,472 hectares in the western sector of the Salinas Grandes salar located in the province of Salta, Argentina. The Salinas Grandes salar is within the Lithium Triangle which hosts several early-stage, developing and producing lithium projects.
The Stella Marys project is adjacent to Orocobre’s Salar de Salinas Grandes project, which hosts a near-surface, low sulfate inferred resource estimate of 56.5 million cubic meters of brine grading 795 mg/l lithium (239,200 tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent) and 9,547 mg/l potassium (1.03 million tonnes of potash equivalent) and 283 mg/l boron.
Advantage Lithium Corp. (TSXV:AAL; OTCQX:AVLIF) has agreed to assign its option over the 1,471-hectare Stella Marys project, located in the Salinas Grandes salar in Salta province, Argentina, to LSC Lithium Corp. Advantage currently holds the MSR option pursuant to an agreement with Minera Santa Rita SRL dated Oct. 27, 2016.
Advantage will receive a 0.5% royalty on the brine concentrate produced from Salinas Grandes Tenements, calculated using the same methodology applied by Orocobre and its affiliates for the calculation of the royalties paid by Orocobre or its affiliates to the provincial government of Jujuy for Orocobre’s last two fiscal years (the “Salinas Grandes Royalty”) regardless of any retroactive or future changes to such methodology made after December 31, 2016.
David Sidoo, president and chief executive officer of Advantage Lithium, commented: “Stella Marys is a prospective project in a strategic location. This transaction allows us to monetize this asset, including a 0.5% royalty across the entire play pf 79,031 hectares, as LSC develops this considerable land package. The timing of the transaction is particularly beneficial as we prepare, with our partner, Orocobre, for an aggressive drill program at our advanced Cauchari project.”
“Acquiring a lithium brine project of this calibre in Argentina’s Lithium Triangle is a tremendous step forward for the company and our progress points clearly to calibre of the management and technical team we have assembled,” stated Sidoo.
Previous work at Stella Marys included a comprehensive exploration program of mapping and sampling, geochemistry, drilling with pump tests, and preliminary engineering.

			Advantage Lithium: Phase 1 Drilling Commences at Cauchari, Argentina; Further Program Details Announced		



                        Lithium                    



                        Argentina                    




VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - May 9, 2017) - Advantage Lithium Corp. (the "Company" or "Advantage Lithium") (TSX VENTURE:AAL)(OTCQX:AVLIF) is pleased to provide further details regarding the Phase One drilling program that has commenced at the company's flagship lithium property located in the Cauchari Salar of Jujuy province in NW Argentina.
Hole CAU07, the first of the five-hole Phase One program at Cauchari (Figure 1) has been collared in the NW block of the JV property exploration target area1, which has been defined with a range of 125 to 1,855 million cubic meters of brine at between 260 and 600mg/l lithium and 2,500 to 5,350mg/l potassium for the lower and upper ranges1 respectively; this represents an in situ range of contained product of between 0.25 to 5.6 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) and 0.9 to 19 million tonnes of potash (KCl).
The hole is expected to drill through a sequence of gravels (Figure 2) before reaching the target salt lake sediments. The pre-collar through the gravels is expected to take three to four weeks, including cementing. This will be completed before moving the rig to drill CAU10 in the south-eastern target area where the existing inferred resource is located. This will allow the cement to cure adequately, while advancing with drilling at CAU10. Further drilling will be completed in the south-eastern area before returning to complete CAU07.
David Sidoo, CEO of Advantage Lithium, commented, "Drilling has now commenced, with the first hole collared in the North-West area of our exploration target approximately 7 km north-west of our existing resource at Cauchari. We are excited by the potential to expand our resource both laterally and at depth, and we look forward to sharing the results as they are received over the coming months."
Cauchari Phase One Drilling and Testing Program
The Phase One program consists of drilling five rotary holes (refer to Figure 2) to a depth of approximately 400 m targeting sand and halite units identified at Cauchari and Olaroz. It is estimated that 3-4 weeks will be required to drill each hole and install a well to the required depth. In-hole geophysical profiling and geological logging will provide the basis for installing screen intervals in the wells.
Other activities will sequentially follow completion and cleaning of the wells. Once clean, brine sampling will be undertaken in the wells at different depth intervals (using packer equipment) to establish the distribution of lithium throughout each well. As detailed sampling will follow well installation, brine analytical results are likely to become available approximately 8 weeks after the initiation of each hole.
Pump testing will then be undertaken following completion of depth sampling, with variable and fixed rate flow tests planned to assess the production capacity and lithium grade of each well. The wells will be installed so they can be used for future brine production.
Additional rotary and/or diamond drill holes will be added as justified by initial results as we proceed towards engineering studies.
The holes to be drilled are located immediately east and west of properties where Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) previously defined a large lithium brine resource in an NI43-101 report dated 11th July 2012. Figure 3 shows the location of the Advantage Lithium exploration target areas relative to the neighboring resource.

The potential quantity and grade of the exploration target is conceptual in nature, and there has been insufficient exploration to define a Mineral Resource in the volume where the Exploration Target is outlined. It is uncertain if further exploration drilling will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource in this volume.
