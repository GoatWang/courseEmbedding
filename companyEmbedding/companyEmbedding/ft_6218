You shipping costs are too high.     5 of 5 | July 23rd, 2017  delivered as advertised at a reasonable price and promptly     5 of 5 | July 22nd, 2017  Easy to navigate , quick, appears to be quality part , I have installed it and functions well.

Surface Mount Ceiling Fixtures - Fluorescent Wraparound
These fluorescent wraparound, unlike recessed troffers, mount onto the surface of ceilings and emit light from the sides of the fixture instead of only downward. Whether you need 2 or 4 foot wraparound fixtures, youâll find the T8 bulb fixture you need for your commercial or residential application. We carry a wide range of widths, styles, wattages, and lens types to suit your needs. These fixtures are available with the lamps sold separately to allow for a customized lighting design. Need help deciding which fixture is the best choice for you? Give us a call at 1-800-624-4488 to speak to a lighting expert.

Product Overview





			            Base mouldings are applied where walls meet floors. Base mouldings are a beautiful way to hide uneven walls and floors where they meet. Creating a foundation for walls, base mouldings give any room that well-grounded look, visually making walls look well set and stable. Used with a base cap and a base shoe, base mouldings can have that built up, larger than life feel. Base mouldings are also great at covering up uneven flooring edges.
