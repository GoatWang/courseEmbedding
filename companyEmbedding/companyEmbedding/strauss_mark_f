New Jersey State Bar Association

                  The New Jersey State Bar Association (NJSBA) is a voluntary bar association for the state of New Jersey.
In June 1899, 74 attorneys launched NJSBA in Atlantic City; annual dues were $5.00.[2] Within the next decade, the Canon of Ethics was adopted by the NJSBA and the Committee on Law Reform, aimed at improving the practice of law and administration of justice in NJ, was formed. Over the years, NJSBA supported the establishment of a Judicial Council to study the problem of an increase in court cases, the replacement of the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals with a Supreme Court, and the repeal of Prohibition. In 1945, NJSBA developed refresher courses for attorneys returning from service in World War II, the forerunner of today's practice of Continuing Legal Education. In the 1980s, paralegals, law office administrators and other non-lawyers were welcomed into NJSBA as associate members.
NJSBA supports 37 practice-oriented sections to support a diverse spectrum of law practice. NJSBA is the publisher of New Jersey Lawyer Magazine. It shares New Jersey Law Center with the New Jersey State Bar Foundation, the Institute for Continuing Legal Education, the IOLTA Fund of the Bar of New Jersey, the New Jersey Lawyers Assistance Program and the New Jersey Commission on Professionalism.                





 Career History



Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy & Business Development

                                    1997 - 2017                


American Water Works Co., Inc.


                  Founded in 1886 as the American Water Works & Guarantee Company, American Water has been serving customers and communities for 125 years, and is the parent company to our nineteen state subsidiaries.

The people of American Water have centuries of combined experience in the water and wastewater industry. The team includes world-renowned researchers who are on the leading edge of scientific study and environmental protection, people who have been with us not only decades, but also for generations, and those who are passionate about environmental stewardship and care. Our crew members and plant operators get up each day with one goal in mind – to make sure American Water provides the best possible water service to our customers. We’re a company with a track record of financial success, environmental compliance, successful partnerships, and commitment to our customers. We are customer and community focused, forward thinking and performance driven.

Our beginnings were humble, and the company's origins can be traced to the local water utilities of the post-civil war era. A small group of entrepreneurs and innovators spurred the nation's industrial development by bringing a critical commodity - pure, abundant water - to towns and cities across the land. In the years that followed, American Water grew and grew as smaller systems were purchased. Our service footprint now stretches across the country and into Canada.

Today, our hard-working teams proudly serve approximately 15 million people in more than 30 states, as well as parts of Canada. We work hard each and every day to supply our customers with something they cannot live without - high-quality water and wastewater services. We are scientists, innovators and stewards of the environment.

Publisher's Description▼▲
A companion to Mark L. Strauss's Four Portraits, One Jesus, these video lectures provide an introduction and summary to every chapter in the widely adopted textbook. Useful for traditional students, students in distance and online-learning courses, and armchair learners alike, these lectures provide a full overview of Jesus' life and ministry from a top New Testament scholar. With clarity and insight, Mark Strauss illuminates the Gospels, first addressing their nature, origin, methods for study, and historical, religious, and cultural backgrounds. He then moves on to closer study of each narrative and its contribution to our understanding of Jesus, investigating things such as plot, characters, and theme. Finally, he pulls it all together with a detailed examination of what the Gospels teach about Jesus' ministry, message, death, and resurrection, with excursions into the quest for the historical Jesus and the historical reliability of the Gospels. A thorough introduction by a master teacher, Four Portraits, One Jesus Video Lectures provides a useful study tool for anyone wanting to better understand the Gospels and their presentation of Jesus.


Author Bio▼▲
Mark Strauss (PhD, Aberdeen) is professor of New Testament at Bethel Seminary in San Diego. He has written The Davidic Messiah in Luke-Acts; Distorting Scripture?: The Challenge of Bible Translation and Gender Accuracy; Luke in the Zondervan Illustrated Bible Background Commentary series; and Mark in the Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament.
