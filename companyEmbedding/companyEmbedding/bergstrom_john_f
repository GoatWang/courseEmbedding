The owners really care about their team and treat them with respect. They have a large number of family-friendly events for their employees, they strive to make the workplace fun, and give back to the community big time. All this plus great pay! They also own a large number of dealerships, and so there are a lot of career advancement opportunities if you work hard.ConsThere aren't many cons that I can think of.

That seems to have been done. So now...work on the payroll department if that hasn't already been done.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Bergstrom Auto Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Bergstrom Auto 2017-01-12 19:22 PST Dec 30, 2016"Couldn't work for a better team."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Product Specialist in Oshkosh, WICurrent Employee - Product Specialist in Oshkosh, WIRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Bergstrom Auto full-timeProsFamily oriented atmosphere.

Amazing culture and positive atmosphere with tons of support.ConsManagement often times hire too many people during summer in fear of guests not getting approached instead of building current team to handle more than one guest and be able to make a living.Advice to ManagementGet a strong group of guys/gals and build them up. Have faith in them to be quick enough to handle more than one person so sales staff can make the needed sales to pay bills and survive and build up business.

You make a good commission every month. You also get a base pay. You know what is expected of your number goals. 88 calls a day.ConsThe communication sucks in the office. The rules change every week that you get to the point of just smiling and nodding because it doesn't matter and it won't be the same next week. You are supposed to be there for the sales teams but they have a skewed vision of what you actually do and you are supposed to be transparent in your work so they can tell what you spoke about in the notes, but all you have to go on regarding the guest is that the salesperson bought their two cats from them and they are nice people!Advice to ManagementThere is a click with the leads and some employees. When you are trying to talk about the problem, the leads cannot be part of it as they are the problem. Communication is a big thing!!!!!! Higher ups, may think that employees don't need to know the ins and outs, but the talking around issues instead of straight to the point needs to stop!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Bergstrom Auto Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Bergstrom Auto 2016-10-11 06:34 PDT Sep 16, 2016"Sales -- BEWARE AND DON'T BOTHER APPLYING"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Auto Sales in Appleton, WIFormer Employee - Auto Sales in Appleton, WIDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at Bergstrom Auto (Less than a year)ProsNone really to tell the truth. They technically gamble in the Saturday morning meetings with $150. Pretty easy cash right there.ConsThe management offer NO TRAINING for the most part. Watch sales boosting training videos, find the information on your Sales License on your own, you get thrown out there to fight for yourself on the lot. Most sales employees there will try and be helpful if you're outgoing, but be opinionated on one little thing and management and some employees will start ignoring you and treating you like crap.Advice to ManagementStop judging your employees on the spot without even trying to offer help.

Be careful of the "cash spiff" program which is more of a cash advance than anything.Advice to ManagementFigure out who wants to be there and who doesn't.

WONDERFUL car dealership! When our daughter moved from NJ to Madison, WI, they helped her with her transportation needs.  They even washed her dirty vehicle! We feel great to know that although Dad can't be there, when she needs service she knows where to go and they treat her right! Great job! 


- Donna K.





My wife and I recently were in the market to purchase a vehicle. Andy was very professional and let us try the car for the day to see if it was the right fit for our family! I was blown away by their kindness and attention to detail and will for sure be doing business with them again in the future. If you need a car their service is second to none!


- Grant O.





My husband and I needed new vehicles. The body shop helped by dealing with the insurance company. The salesman Matt in Neenah helped us. He listened to what we wanted and we didn't feel pushed into buying just anything. We also check market pricing and got great pricing for our Cruz and Malibu!

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
