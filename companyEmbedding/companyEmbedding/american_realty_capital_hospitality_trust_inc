American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust Completes Acquisition of Equity Inns Lodging Portfolio for $1.8 Billion 








































menuclose









Industry Update




Press Release 1 March 2015American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust Completes Acquisition of Equity Inns Lodging Portfolio for $1.8 Billion 

 American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust, Inc. ("ARC Hospitality") announced today that it has completed the previously announced acquisition of the Equity Inns Lodging Portfolio ("Equity Inns" or the "Portfolio") from affiliates of the Whitehall Real Estate Funds sponsored by Goldman Sachs. The total purchase price was $1.8 billion, exclusive of closing costs. 

The Portfolio consists of 116 hotels totaling 13,744 rooms across 31 states, all franchised by Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Marriott International, Hyatt Hotels and InterContinental Hotels Group. The hotels include leading brands such as Hampton Inn, Hilton Garden Inn, Homewood Suites, Embassy Suites, Courtyard, Residence Inn, Hyatt Place and Holiday Inn.

The acquisition of the Portfolio increases ARC Hospitality's lodging portfolio to 122 hotels totaling 14,925 rooms, establishing ARC Hospitality as one of the largest owners of select-service hotels in the North American lodging REIT sector.
"We are delighted to announce the acquisition of the Equity Inns portfolio, which represents a transformational event for ARC Hospitality," commented William M. Kahane, Chairman of ARC Hospitality. "In our opinion, Equity Inns offers compelling value among recently marketed and comparable select-service portfolios from the standpoint of both price per key, as well as on a yield basis. This nationwide portfolio of high-quality, stabilized hotels with strong brand affiliations, geographic diversification and healthy growth dynamics, supports our strategy of providing consistent distributions and the potential for capital appreciation to our investors."
"The Equity Inns purchase marks the largest acquisition in the history of the non-traded REIT industry, and propels ARC Hospitality into a leadership position among select-service lodging REITs in North America," said Jonathan P. Mehlman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ARC Hospitality. "Our diligence on this transaction began nearly one year ago. Since then, we have seen positive upward trends in the Portfolio's operating results, exceeding our initial underwriting expectations. We believe the combination of an improving economy, our ability to purchase hotels with stable occupancies at a discount to replacement cost, as reflected by this transaction, and our cultivated relationship with our management company partners has created a solid platform for ARC Hospitality to drive shareholder value."
Edward T. Hoganson, Chief Financial Officer of ARC Hospitality, added, "The Equity Inns portfolio has a majority of properties located in the top 100 MSAs and premier locations in their respective markets, and we believe it exhibits strong top- and bottom-line growth fundamentals. As part of this transaction, we were able to secure what we consider to be attractive financing, which we expect will support the Company's distributions going forward. We are pleased to continue building our relationships with the franchise brands, who were instrumental to us throughout the transaction process and closing."
In connection with the acquisition, ARC Hospitality assumed $903.9 million of debt financing which is collateralized by 96 of the 116 properties. Simultaneously with the closing, ARC Hospitality obtained $227.0 million of first mortgage financing for the remaining 20 properties. The sellers will retain a preferred equity interest of $447.1 million that carries no prepayment restrictions or penalties. ARC Hospitality funded the remaining $230.1 million with cash-on-hand from proceeds of the offering of its common stock.
RCS Capital, the investment banking and capital markets division of Realty Capital Securities, LLC, a subsidiary of RCS Capital Corporation (NYSE: RCAP), acted as financial advisor to ARC Hospitality. RCS Capital Corporation is under common control with the parent of the sponsor of ARC Hospitality. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. acted as financial advisors to the sellers. Goodwin Procter LLP and Proskauer Rose LLP acted as legal advisors to ARC Hospitality. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as legal advisor to the sellers.

NEW YORK, June 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust, Inc. ("ARC Hospitality" or the "Company") announced today that it has agreed to acquire a portfolio of 26 hotels (the "Summit Portfolio") for a purchase price of $351.4 million from Summit Hotel Properties, Inc., a publicly-traded hotel real estate investment trust ("Summit").
The Summit Portfolio consists of 25 premium-branded select-service and extended-stay hotels and one full-service hotel and totals 2,793 rooms in 11 states. The hotels are franchised by major global brands including Marriott International, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Hyatt Hotels and InterContinental Hotels Group. Leading flags include Fairfield Inn & Suites, Courtyard by Marriott, Hampton Inn, SpringHill Suites and Residence Inn.
The Company also announced last week that it intends to acquire a portfolio of five hotels totaling 565 rooms (the "Wheelock Portfolio") for a purchase price of $92.5 million from affiliates of Wheelock Real Estate Fund, L.P. sponsored by Wheelock Street Capital, LLC, a real estate private equity firm.
The acquisitions of the Summit Portfolio and Wheelock Portfolio, when completed, will increase ARC Hospitality's lodging portfolio to 153 hotels totaling 18,280 rooms across 33 states, enhancing the Company's position as one of the largest owners of select-service hotels (by enterprise value) in the North American lodging REIT sector.
"The Summit Portfolio represents an ideal property fit for ARC Hospitality. We are pleased to add this portfolio of high-quality, stabilized lodging properties with strong brand affiliations to our expanding platform," commented Jonathan P. Mehlman, Chief Executive Officer of ARC Hospitality. "We are excited to acquire a portfolio that we believe offers both an attractive yield and price per key, as well as scale, brand power, and consistent and growing cash flows that in our view have been unmatched among marketed portfolios this year. We believe it is still an opportune time to acquire well-located, high-quality upscale and upper midscale hotels as the lodging cycle, and the select-service segment in particular, continues its extended recovery. We believe this acquisition will contribute to our vision of creating a best-in-class portfolio that supports our strategy of providing consistent distributions and the potential for capital appreciation to our investors."
Edward Hoganson, Chief Financial Officer of ARC Hospitality, added, "We are pleased to announce the acquisition of this premier, well-located portfolio that we believe exhibits strong in-place operating fundamentals as well as attractive growth opportunities. Working with Dan Hansen and the Summit management team on this off-market transaction has been a smooth and efficient process, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with his exceptional team, as well as with the franchise brands, through the closing of this transaction."
The acquisition, which is encompassed in two separate purchase and sale agreements, is subject to customary franchisor approvals and the completion of customary and confirmatory due diligence as well as other conditions. The acquisition is expected to close in three separate tranches (which are not conditioned on each other), with the current estimated sale dates in September 2015, October 2015 and January 2016, subject to extension under certain circumstances. ARC Hospitality intends to secure debt financing in connection with the acquisition.
ARC Hospitality was represented by Proskauer Rose, which also represented ARC Hospitality in connection with the acquisition of the Wheelock Portfolio.

NEW YORK, Feb. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust, Inc. ("ARC Hospitality") announced today that it has completed the previously announced acquisition of the Equity Inns Lodging Portfolio ("Equity Inns" or the "Portfolio") from affiliates of the Whitehall Real Estate Funds sponsored by Goldman Sachs. The total purchase price was $1.8 billion, exclusive of closing costs. 
The Portfolio consists of 116 hotels totaling 13,744 rooms across 31 states, all franchised by Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Marriott International, Hyatt Hotels and InterContinental Hotels Group. The hotels include leading brands such as Hampton Inn, Hilton Garden Inn, Homewood Suites, Embassy Suites, Courtyard, Residence Inn, Hyatt Place and Holiday Inn.
The acquisition of the Portfolio increases ARC Hospitality's lodging portfolio to 122 hotels totaling 14,925 rooms, establishing ARC Hospitality as one of the largest owners of select-service hotels in the North American lodging REIT sector.
"We are delighted to announce the acquisition of the Equity Inns portfolio, which represents a transformational event for ARC Hospitality," commented William M. Kahane, Chairman of ARC Hospitality. "In our opinion, Equity Inns offers compelling value among recently marketed and comparable select-service portfolios from the standpoint of both price per key, as well as on a yield basis. This nationwide portfolio of high-quality, stabilized hotels with strong brand affiliations, geographic diversification and healthy growth dynamics, supports our strategy of providing consistent distributions and the potential for capital appreciation to our investors." 
"The Equity Inns purchase marks the largest acquisition in the history of the non-traded REIT industry, and propels ARC Hospitality into a leadership position among select-service lodging REITs in North America," said Jonathan P. Mehlman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ARC Hospitality. "Our diligence on this transaction began nearly one year ago. Since then, we have seen positive upward trends in the Portfolio's operating results, exceeding our initial underwriting expectations. We believe the combination of an improving economy, our ability to purchase hotels with stable occupancies at a discount to replacement cost, as reflected by this transaction, and our cultivated relationship with our management company partners has created a solid platform for ARC Hospitality to drive shareholder value."
Edward T. Hoganson, Chief Financial Officer of ARC Hospitality, added, "The Equity Inns portfolio has a majority of properties located in the top 100 MSAs and premier locations in their respective markets, and we believe it exhibits strong top- and bottom-line growth fundamentals. As part of this transaction, we were able to secure what we consider to be attractive financing, which we expect will support the Company's distributions going forward. We are pleased to continue building our relationships with the franchise brands, who were instrumental to us throughout the transaction process and closing."
In connection with the acquisition, ARC Hospitality assumed $903.9 million of debt financing which is collateralized by 96 of the 116 properties. Simultaneously with the closing, ARC Hospitality obtained $227.0 million of first mortgage financing for the remaining 20 properties. The sellers will retain a preferred equity interest of $447.1 million that carries no prepayment restrictions or penalties. ARC Hospitality funded the remaining $230.1 million with cash-on-hand from proceeds of the offering of its common stock.
RCS Capital, the investment banking and capital markets division of Realty Capital Securities, LLC, a subsidiary of RCS Capital Corporation (NYSE:   RCAP), acted as financial advisor to ARC Hospitality. RCS Capital Corporation is under common control with the parent of the sponsor of ARC Hospitality. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. acted as financial advisors to the sellers. Goodwin Procter LLP and Proskauer Rose LLP acted as legal advisors to ARC Hospitality. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as legal advisor to the sellers.
