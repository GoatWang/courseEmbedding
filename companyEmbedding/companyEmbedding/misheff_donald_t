SunRidge Canyon Golf Club Purchased by Don and Cindy Misheff








Don and Cindy Misheff, part-time Fountain Hills residents, recently announced the acquisition of SunRidge Canyon Golf Club in Fountain Hills, 
Arizona. The Misheffs along with key management purchased the club from
Sunbelt Holdings. 





“This is a dream-come-true for us,” said Don 
Misheff. “As avid golfers who are passionate about the game and all 
that comes with it, Cindy and I visualized this for many years, 
especially during our visits to Fountain Hills. The pieces just started 
to fall into place, and we’re now happy to report our long-term 
commitment to the Fountain Hills community to preserve and even improve 
the golf experience at SunRidge Canyon. To reach this goal, we already 
chose a local golf-savvy management team to make that happen.”  





Jeff Lessig was hired as the general manager, and Derek Crawford assumes the position of director of operations. Lessig’s new position at SunRidge Canyon Golf Club marks a homecoming; he was the club’s original general manager for six years after it opened for public play in 1995, prior to taking on the general manager position at We-Ko-Pa Golf Club. And during his time at We-Ko-Pa, Lessig worked with Crawford, who recently accepted a position at SunRidge Canyon to once again work alongside Lessig as the golf club’s new director of operations.  


In addition to his nine-year stint at We-Ko-Pa, Crawford joins the SunRidge Canyon team after decades of experience at other clubs in the local Phoenix/Scottsdale golf scene. And the management team will also include two people who have worked at the club from its inception. Ron Ruppert will continue as the golf course superintendant, and Brian Billmore will carry on as the food and beverage manager.   


“I am eager to get started at SunRidge Canyon,” said Lessig. “The Misheffs bring with them the right combination of professionalism wrapped up in their down-to-earth personality that is well suited for the golf business. We intend to make the best of this opportunity to usher SunRidge Canyon into a new era of prosperity with an exceptional golf experience and attentive customer service leading the way.” 

About:

The Misheffs
Don Misheff currently serves as Managing Partner for the Northeast Ohio offices of Ernst & Young – a firm he has been with for 32 years. In addition to his career at Ernst & Young, he also serves on numerous community boards including the Chairman of Firestone Country Club, Chairman of the Cuyahoga Community College (Tri-C) Foundation, Trustee of Ashland University, Bridgestone Invitational Championship Council, the Greater Akron Chamber (Emeritus), Greater Cleveland Sports Commission, the United Way Executive Cabinet and others. Cindy, a retired teacher, serves as the Chairman of the Board of the Ronald McDonald House of Akron, among other civic-minded pursuits.


Additionally, both are graduates of the University of Akron. Don has been recognized as a distinguished alumnus of the University of Akron’s Business School as well as the University of Akron’s Accounting Program. He is a Certified Public Accountant and member of the Ohio and American Society of Certified Public Accountants.  


The Misheffs began visiting the Valley of the Sun decades ago during their annual spring break getaway with their two daughters, Kaitlyn and Erin. These trips eventually lead to the purchase of a vacation home in Fountain Hills. Don is also a member to Whisper Rock Golf Club in Scottsdale. 




 


SunRidge Canyon Golf Club


SunRidge Canyon Golf Club features an 18-hole, Keith Foster-designed golf course located on the eastern slope of the McDowell Mountains in Fountain Hills, Arizona. Open since 1995, SunRidge Canyon has been recognized as one of Arizona’s finest golf facilities by numerous golf publications as well as local golfers. The 6,823-yard, par-71 golf course works its way down a large canyon that defines the property, descending subtly during the front nine before bending around to climb up the canyon on the back nine. 


Along the way, golfers discover that the course wasn’t so much built by a bulldozer as it was created over eons by the relentless pressure of wind and water. Foster had the good sense to follow Mother Nature’s lead to instill SunRidge Canyon with a measure of beauty and challenge unlike any other desert golf course in the Valley. In fact, many have called out its finishing holes are the toughest in the state.  


The club’s Spanish hacienda-style clubhouse provides a beautiful setting for those looking for an awe-inspiring site for weddings, receptions, awards banquets or any type of special event. Among other things, guests are treated to stunning mountain views as well as the property’s shimmering water features and lush Sonoran Desert landscape.
