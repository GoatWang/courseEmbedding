Bowles, Crandall Close
October 16, 1947 -- 






Written by Rick D. BoulwareBorn in Fort Mill on October 16, 1947, she was the first of eight children of H. William Close and Anne Kingsley Springs. A direct descendent of the textile manufacturing pioneers Samuel Elliott White and Leroy Springs, Bowles is the fifth generation to run Springs Industries. As a CEO, Bowles is regularly ranked among the top women executives in the country. 

Businesswoman. In 1998 Bowles began serving as chair and chief executive officer (CEO) of Springs Industries, whose corporate headquarters are in Fort Mill. Born in Fort Mill on October 16, 1947, she was the first of eight children of H. William Close and Anne Kingsley Springs. A direct descendent of the textile manufacturing pioneers Samuel Elliott White and Leroy Springs, Bowles is the fifth generation to run Springs Industries. As a CEO, Bowles is regularly ranked among the top women executives in the country.
Bowles earned a B.A. in economics from Wellesley College in 1969 and an M.B.A. from Columbia University. Her first employment was in New York, where she worked as a statistician for Morgan Stanley & Co. In 1971 she married Erskine B. Bowles, a North Carolinian she had met at Morgan Stanley. They moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1972, where he built an investment bank and they raised their three children. Erskine Bowles would go on to serve as White House chief of staff during the presidential administration of William Clinton.
Prior to becoming CEO, Crandall Bowles was a financial analyst for Springs Industries and executive vice president and later president of Springs Company, the Close family’s investment management arm. According to Business Week, “For a decade, she ran the $700 million Close family fortune, and she still leads her mother and seven siblings in overseeing the real estate, insurance, and rail- road holdings that complement a controlling stake in . . . Springs.” She later received more extensive training by serving posts in corporate planning, textile manufacturing, and bath products for Springs Industries before becoming its president and chief operating officer in 1997.

She, Crandall Close Bowles, is married to Erskine Bowles, he of the wealth-connected cat food commission, AKA President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform AKA Bowles-Simpson or Simpson-Bowles.
According to Bloomberg, she has also served in various leadership capacities on various aspects of a corporation basically called Springs Global, Springs Company, et al, as an Executive Vice President of Textile Production. She also has been a Director of John Deere Financial Services, Inc. and Deere & Company, as well as a Director of JPMorgan Chase & Co., that since November 15, 2006, as an Independent Director of Hillshire Brands Company, Wachovia Corporation from 1991 to 1996. Crandall Bowles serves as a Member of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, The Business Council, The Business Roundtable and the Palmetto Business Forum. She is a Trustee of the Brookings Institution and is on the governing boards of the Packard Center at Johns Hopkins, The University of North Carolina Press, The Wilderness Society, and the Global Research institute of UNC-Chapel Hill. She serves as a Member of the Committee of 200, [gasp!] and this is but a sampling of boards and commissions upon which Crandall Close Bowles serves, a list well-larded with worthy causes in order to cleanse her resume.






Ms Bowles came to my attention when I read:
Crandall C. Bowles, a director of Deere & Company and the Sara Lee Corporation, a former director of Wachovia, a Trustee of the Brookings Institution, on the Governing Board of the Wilderness Society, and a member of the Business Council and the Economic Club of New York ...
in an Alternet report entitled: Meet the Elites Inside the $4 Trillion Global Powerhouse Bank of JP Morgan Chase.
Bowles. Bowles? Where have I seen that name before? Simipson Bowles, of course, Erskine Bowles, possibly a brother to Crandall Bowles, no, her husband, owing to the propensity of the wealthy to give their daughters strange names.
Who is there not to love among the JP Morgan Chase Manhattan etc. elites? Adorable Jamie Dimon! Darling Henry Kissinger who sits on the International Council of JPMorgan! And, that cozy little armful Lee Raymond, director of the Business Council for International Understanding, who sits on the advisory panel to KKR, is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and former Chairman of the National Petroleum Council as well as former Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, from which he retired in 2006 with a compensation package of $398 million.
So now she's serving on the Board of Directors of JP Morgan Chase. Isn't that sweet? And, isn't it sweet to know where Erksine Bowles' heart resides?
As Bloomberg notes, Crandall Bowles is connected to 62 board members in 4 different organizations across 7 different industries and her annual compensation is close to twice my net worth.

Springs Global

The big headline for Crandall Close Bowles in 2007 centers on what she isn't doing anymore.
Bowles and the Close family cashed out most of its equity in Springs Global this year as the company went public in a $300 million Brazilian stock offering. The family kept only 5% of the textile giant that was founded in 1887 in Fort Mill by Bowles' great-great grandfather, Samuel Elliott White, and great grandfather, Leroy Springs.

Bowles resigned from her position as co-chief executive at Springs Global, handing power to her Brazilian partner, Josue Christiano Gomes da Silva.
"In the current stock offering, my family will sell a significant portion of our Springs Global holdings. I will continue to serve on the board of Springs Global," Bowles said in July. "I will leave knowing that our company has survived radical change and emerged with solid market value. I have great confidence in my co-CEO and successor, Josue Gomes, and the rest of the management team."
The process that led to Bowles departure started in January 2006 when Springs Industries Inc. merged with Brazilian textile giant Coteminas, forming Springs Global.
The merger combined Springs' sheet and towel operations with Coteminas' fabric production, making the consolidated company the world's largest home-furnishings manufacturer.
In the end, the merger that formed Springs Global US put the company in a position to survive the dramatic decline of the U.S. textile industry, industry analysts say.
What did Springs get out of the deal? The low-cost production capabilities of its Brazilian partner, Coteminas.
Bowles had become the fifth generation of the Springs family to run the company in 1998. She served 10 years as chief executive of an independent Springs Industries. At the time of her appointment, industry watchers speculated that she was brought in to make the tough decisions: cutting jobs and closing plants as the nation in 1995 saw an end to the international textile quota system, which had limited imports from low-wage countries.

When the nation's borders were thrown open to inexpensive home-textile imports, Springs, Pillowtex Corp., J.P. Stevens and other U.S. textile companies couldn't compete.
In the first of Bowles's strategies to stay afloat in a sea of inexpensive home-fashion textile imports, the family formed a partnership with an investment fund to take the company private.




 


Springs formed its first alliance with Coteminas in 2001.
As more production moved off shore, Springs Global began rapidly shuttering U.S. plants starting in 2004 with the closing of the Lyman plant in Lyman, S.C., and the Wamsutta plant in Anderson, S.C., eliminating 540 jobs. It concluded with the end of all manufacturing in its home state in 2007 as production was halted at the Grace plant in Lancaster and the Close plant in Fort Lawn.
"The closing of these plants reflects the global nature of the textile industry, which has made U.S. textile manufacturing uncompetitive," Bowles said in a prepared statement at the time the final closings were announced. "Though inevitable for the company, this move is a sad and difficult one for my family and the people and communities involved. We would like to express our deepest appreciation to all the associates for their years of commitment and productive efforts for this company."
In between was the loss of 1,460 jobs at the Frances and Elliott plants in Fort Lawn and the Katherine plant in Chester. In 1992, Springs employed 14,000 in South Carolina.
Now, 700 Springs Global workers remain in South Carolina, mostly at distribution centers in Fort Lawn and Lancaster and at the former Springs Industries headquarters in Fort Mill.
Although she remains on the Springs Global board, Bowles has started a part-time post as a senior advisor to the N.C. Department of Commerce. Her job is to monitor N.C. businesses' competitiveness in various industry sectors.
Bowles's husband, former Charlotte investment banker Erskine Bowles, is the president of the 16-campus UNC System.
Despite Bowles' and the Close family's virtual departure from Springs Global, both will be forever linked to the Fort Mill area, where family land holdings count in the thousands of acres.
On 1,000-plus acres between Interstate 77 and the Catawba River, the family built a successful neotraditional neighborhood called the Village of Baxter. It was one a series of villages planned for family land in the area.

Crandall Close Bowles is the latest in a family of leaders at the helm of Springs Global US Inc., the 120-year-old textile giant formerly known Springs Industries Inc., based in Fort Mill, S.C., until its merger this year with Brazil's Coteminas.
Bowles' grandfather, Col. Elliott White Springs, helped launch the company. Her father, H.W. "Bill" Close, expanded the corporation and took it public. In 2001, Bowles returned it to private ownership.




 


Leadership is never far from her, even at home. Her husband, Erskine Bowles, is president of the University of North Carolina System, a two-time U.S. Senate candidate and former chief of staff in the administration of President Bill Clinton.
Crandall Bowles joined Springs Industries as an executive vice president in 1992, held several assignments and was appointed president and chief operating officer in 1997. She became chairman and chief executive in 1998.
She recently discussed the challenges of leadership as part of the Leaders In Action speakers' series at Queens University of Charlotte's McColl Graduate School of Business. Edited excerpts of an interview afterward follow:





What kinds of leaders were your father and grandfather?
Most leaders end up being strong one way or another. Both started working in the plants. My grandfather, being the founder, knew everything about the business. He was very visionary in where he saw the company going. He also had a group of men who he relied on.
My father had an expanded group of people he worked with and was more relationship-oriented. He was a better delegator. I would say he understood where the company was going and had the opportunity to expand.
In the 1960s, he took the company public. He also had the courage to bring in the first outsider, Peter Scotese, to serve as president. He brought the company more into the modern corporate world.
I once read that your first job was at the Peach Stand (a market and restaurant in Fort Mill). Did you learn anything there about working with people that serves you today?
I made 50 cents an hour. I certainly learned the discipline of knowing to be on time. It's more about dealing with different people than anything else. It's part of a process that teaches you that the customer is always right.





 


How do you describe your leadership style?
My leadership style has evolved. It's collaborative. I came into the textile business later in my career. There were people who knew more about the business and I rely more on their experience and judgment.
I bring a logic and a willingness to challenge preconceived notions and the way things "have always been done." I've had to lead through tremendous change in the industry. (At Queens) I talked about leading a company through a transition that had a lot of difficult or negative connotations for the people that are working in this area.
Do you feel there are unique leadership skills that are required in the textile industry? Have the skills you use changed as the industry has changed?
You have to be willing to change. You get kind of dragged along, and you can't be in denial. You have to be willing to see that things have to change and can't operate in the same way.
Your husband is a prominent leader as well. Do you ever discuss leadership strategies at home?
Not really. He has a different approach and one that's objective. We talk about being on different boards. He's got a lot of leadership opportunities and is following two very strong leaders (as UNC System president), Dick Spangler and Bill Friday.

Erskine Boyce Bowles (born August 8, 1945) is an American businessman and political figure from North Carolina. He served from 2005 to 2010[1] as the president of the University of North Carolina system. In 1997–98 he served as White House Chief of Staff and he also ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from North Carolina in 2002 and 2004.
In 2010 Bowles served as the Democratic co-chair of President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson.[2] Bowles and Simpson co-led a business group, The Campaign to Fix the Debt.[3]

Early life and education[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Bowles was born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina and is the son of Jessamine Woodward Boyce Bowles and the late Hargrove "Skipper" Bowles, Jr., a Democratic politician who ran unsuccessfully for Governor of North Carolina in 1972. Siblings include Hargrove Bowles III, Mary Holland Bowles Blanton and the late Martha Thomas Bowles. Bowles graduated from Virginia Episcopal School before attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity and graduated with a business degree. After briefly serving in the United States Coast Guard, Bowles then enrolled in Columbia Business School, where he earned an MBA.
Following graduation, Bowles worked for the financial firm Morgan Stanley in New York City, where he met his future wife, Crandall Close. The two married in 1971 and moved to North Carolina, where Bowles worked on his father's 1972 gubernatorial campaign. Crandall and Erskine have three children: Sam, Annie, and Bill. In 1975, Bowles helped launch the investment banking firm of Bowles Hollowell Conner, and remained in the corporate sector until the 1990s.
The Clinton years[edit]
In 1992, he became more involved in politics as a fundraiser for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. President Clinton appointed Bowles to head the Small Business Administration in 1993. From October 1994 to December 1995, Bowles served as Clinton's White House Deputy Chief of Staff, in the first term of the Clinton Administration.
After briefly returning to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he helped found the private equity firm Carousel Capital, Bowles was appointed Clinton's Chief of Staff in December 1996. One of Bowles's major responsibilities was dealing with federal budget negotiations between the White House and Congress. Bowles returned to Charlotte, North Carolina and to the field of finance again in October 1998. He was also asked by North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt to head a task force on rural economic prosperity.

Senatorial races[edit]
Although initially reluctant to seek political office, Bowles reconsidered a run for the United States Senate after the September 11, 2001 attacks and, in October 2001, declared his candidacy for the Senate as a Democratic candidate. Seeking to fill the seat being vacated by Jesse Helms, Bowles secured the party's nomination, but was defeated in the 2002 general election by Republican contender Elizabeth Dole.
In 2004, Bowles campaigned again for the Senate, seeking to fill the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat John Edwards. He faced Republican Richard Burr and Libertarian Tom Bailey in a hotly contested race. The final month of the Senate campaign saw both Bowles's and Burr's campaigns turn strongly negative, with Burr's campaign attacking Bowles's associations with the Clinton administration, while Bowles's campaign attacked Burr on his support of trade legislation and special interest donations. Both campaigns spent a great deal of money, making it one of the most expensive statewide races in North Carolina history.
Despite an early lead in the polls after the primaries, as well as fellow Democrat Mike Easley running for a second term as governor at the top of the state party ticket, Bowles was defeated in the 2004 race as well. President Bush's comfortable electoral victory in North Carolina likely helped Burr considerably. During his concession speech in Raleigh at the Democratic headquarters, he thanked his supporters but seemed to indicate that he would not run for office again. Quoting his father, he said there were "many ways to add to the community woodpile" and that political office was only one of them. Accordingly, in 2005 Bowles accepted an appointment as United Nations Deputy Special Envoy for Tsunami-affected Countries, once again working for Bill Clinton who was now serving as U.N. Special Envoy.
Since 2005[edit]
On October 3, 2005, Bowles was elected by the University of North Carolina's Board of Governors to succeed Molly Corbett Broad as President of the system, even though some suggest that the Board of Governors broke the law in not holding public hearings in the hiring process.[4] One of his most significant appointments was that of Holden Thorp as the tenth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who resigned on September 17, 2012 in the wake of several athletics-related scandals.[5] Bowles also spoke at the campus memorial service in memory of slain student body president Eve Carson.
On February 12, 2010, Bowles announced his retirement from the UNC System.[6][7] Bowles was replaced by Thomas W. Ross.[8]
Bowles is also a member of the board of directors of General Motors, Morgan Stanley, Norfolk Southern Corporation,[9] and North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and serves on the North Carolina Advisory Board of DonorsChoose.
Bowles was appointed in 2010 to co-chair President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson.[2] The commission deadlocked, and the co-chairs' report on a policy for budget deficit reduction was not adopted by the Obama administration.[10] Surprised by the rejection, Bowles later stated he believed that Obama decided to abandon the report and let [incoming House Budget Chairman] Paul Ryan go first, and then he would look like the sensible guy in the game, based on advice from his political advisers and over the objections of his economic team.[10]
On September 7, 2011, Facebook, Inc. announced that it had named Bowles to its board.[11]
After North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue announced that she would not run for a second term in 2012, Bowles was mentioned as a possible candidate, and polling put him almost even with likely Republican nominee Pat McCrory. But on February 2, 2012, Bowles announced that he would not seek the governorship.[12]
On August 14, 2012, Bowles gave an interview with The Daily Caller where he asserted that he is not "backing away" from his praise of Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan. Said Bowles: “I think he's smart. I think he's intellectually curious. I think he is honest, straightforward and sincere. And I think he does have a serious budget out there — it doesn’t mean I agree with it by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm not going to act like I don't like him or that I don't have some real respect for him." Along with his praise of Ryan he also had criticism of the current government. Said Bowles: “The people of this country get it. They know that the fiscal path this country is on is not sustainable and that these deficits of over a trillion dollars a year are a cancer that in time will destroy our Country from within..." Despite his praise of Ryan, Bowles says he plans on voting for President Obama in November. “Who I vote for is my business, but I am certainly a registered Democrat and I’m proud to be so,” Bowles said in the phone interview. “And I certainly envision voting for the president for sure.” [13]

Erskine Boyce Bowles (born August 8, 1945) is an American businessman and political figure from North Carolina. He served from 2005 to 2010[1] as the president of the University of North Carolina system. In 1997–98 he served as White House Chief of Staff and he also ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from North Carolina in 2002 and 2004.
In 2010 Bowles served as the Democratic co-chair of President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson.[2] Bowles and Simpson co-led a business group, The Campaign to Fix the Debt.[3]

Early life and education[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Bowles was born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina and is the son of Jessamine Woodward Boyce Bowles and the late Hargrove "Skipper" Bowles, Jr., a Democratic politician who ran unsuccessfully for Governor of North Carolina in 1972. Siblings include Hargrove Bowles III, Mary Holland Bowles Blanton and the late Martha Thomas Bowles. Bowles graduated from Virginia Episcopal School before attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity and graduated with a business degree. After briefly serving in the United States Coast Guard, Bowles then enrolled in Columbia Business School, where he earned an MBA.
Following graduation, Bowles worked for the financial firm Morgan Stanley in New York City, where he met his future wife, Crandall Close. The two married in 1971 and moved to North Carolina, where Bowles worked on his father's 1972 gubernatorial campaign. Crandall and Erskine have three children: Sam, Annie, and Bill. In 1975, Bowles helped launch the investment banking firm of Bowles Hollowell Conner, and remained in the corporate sector until the 1990s.
The Clinton years[edit]
In 1992, he became more involved in politics as a fundraiser for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. President Clinton appointed Bowles to head the Small Business Administration in 1993. From October 1994 to December 1995, Bowles served as Clinton's White House Deputy Chief of Staff, in the first term of the Clinton Administration.
After briefly returning to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he helped found the private equity firm Carousel Capital, Bowles was appointed Clinton's Chief of Staff in December 1996. One of Bowles's major responsibilities was dealing with federal budget negotiations between the White House and Congress. Bowles returned to Charlotte, North Carolina and to the field of finance again in October 1998. He was also asked by North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt to head a task force on rural economic prosperity.

Senatorial races[edit]
Although initially reluctant to seek political office, Bowles reconsidered a run for the United States Senate after the September 11, 2001 attacks and, in October 2001, declared his candidacy for the Senate as a Democratic candidate. Seeking to fill the seat being vacated by Jesse Helms, Bowles secured the party's nomination, but was defeated in the 2002 general election by Republican contender Elizabeth Dole.
In 2004, Bowles campaigned again for the Senate, seeking to fill the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat John Edwards. He faced Republican Richard Burr and Libertarian Tom Bailey in a hotly contested race. The final month of the Senate campaign saw both Bowles's and Burr's campaigns turn strongly negative, with Burr's campaign attacking Bowles's associations with the Clinton administration, while Bowles's campaign attacked Burr on his support of trade legislation and special interest donations. Both campaigns spent a great deal of money, making it one of the most expensive statewide races in North Carolina history.
Despite an early lead in the polls after the primaries, as well as fellow Democrat Mike Easley running for a second term as governor at the top of the state party ticket, Bowles was defeated in the 2004 race as well. President Bush's comfortable electoral victory in North Carolina likely helped Burr considerably. During his concession speech in Raleigh at the Democratic headquarters, he thanked his supporters but seemed to indicate that he would not run for office again. Quoting his father, he said there were "many ways to add to the community woodpile" and that political office was only one of them. Accordingly, in 2005 Bowles accepted an appointment as United Nations Deputy Special Envoy for Tsunami-affected Countries, once again working for Bill Clinton who was now serving as U.N. Special Envoy.
Since 2005[edit]
On October 3, 2005, Bowles was elected by the University of North Carolina's Board of Governors to succeed Molly Corbett Broad as President of the system, even though some suggest that the Board of Governors broke the law in not holding public hearings in the hiring process.[4] One of his most significant appointments was that of Holden Thorp as the tenth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who resigned on September 17, 2012 in the wake of several athletics-related scandals.[5] Bowles also spoke at the campus memorial service in memory of slain student body president Eve Carson.
On February 12, 2010, Bowles announced his retirement from the UNC System.[6][7] Bowles was replaced by Thomas W. Ross.[8]
Bowles is also a member of the board of directors of General Motors, Morgan Stanley, Norfolk Southern Corporation,[9] and North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and serves on the North Carolina Advisory Board of DonorsChoose.
Bowles was appointed in 2010 to co-chair President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson.[2] The commission deadlocked, and the co-chairs' report on a policy for budget deficit reduction was not adopted by the Obama administration.[10] Surprised by the rejection, Bowles later stated he believed that Obama decided to abandon the report and let [incoming House Budget Chairman] Paul Ryan go first, and then he would look like the sensible guy in the game, based on advice from his political advisers and over the objections of his economic team.[10]
On September 7, 2011, Facebook, Inc. announced that it had named Bowles to its board.[11]
After North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue announced that she would not run for a second term in 2012, Bowles was mentioned as a possible candidate, and polling put him almost even with likely Republican nominee Pat McCrory. But on February 2, 2012, Bowles announced that he would not seek the governorship.[12]
On August 14, 2012, Bowles gave an interview with The Daily Caller where he asserted that he is not "backing away" from his praise of Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan. Said Bowles: “I think he's smart. I think he's intellectually curious. I think he is honest, straightforward and sincere. And I think he does have a serious budget out there — it doesn’t mean I agree with it by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm not going to act like I don't like him or that I don't have some real respect for him." Along with his praise of Ryan he also had criticism of the current government. Said Bowles: “The people of this country get it. They know that the fiscal path this country is on is not sustainable and that these deficits of over a trillion dollars a year are a cancer that in time will destroy our Country from within..." Despite his praise of Ryan, Bowles says he plans on voting for President Obama in November. “Who I vote for is my business, but I am certainly a registered Democrat and I’m proud to be so,” Bowles said in the phone interview. “And I certainly envision voting for the president for sure.” [13]

Early life and education[edit]

Bowles was born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina and is the son of Jessamine Woodward Boyce Bowles and the late Hargrove "Skipper" Bowles, Jr., a Democratic politician who ran unsuccessfully for Governor of North Carolina in 1972. Siblings include Hargrove Bowles III, Mary Holland Bowles Blanton and the late Martha Thomas Bowles. Bowles graduated from Virginia Episcopal School before attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity and graduated with a business degree. After briefly serving in the United States Coast Guard, Bowles then enrolled in Columbia Business School, where he earned an MBA.
Following graduation, Bowles worked for the financial firm Morgan Stanley in New York City, where he met his future wife, Crandall Close. The two married in 1971 and moved to North Carolina, where Bowles worked on his father's 1972 gubernatorial campaign. Crandall and Erskine have three children: Sam, Annie, and Bill. In 1975, Bowles helped launch the investment banking firm of Bowles Hollowell Conner, and remained in the corporate sector until the 1990s.
The Clinton years[edit]
In 1992, he became more involved in politics as a fundraiser for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. President Clinton appointed Bowles to head the Small Business Administration in 1993. From October 1994 to December 1995, Bowles served as Clinton's White House Deputy Chief of Staff, in the first term of the Clinton Administration.
After briefly returning to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he helped found the private equity firm Carousel Capital, Bowles was appointed Clinton's Chief of Staff in December 1996. One of Bowles's major responsibilities was dealing with federal budget negotiations between the White House and Congress. Bowles returned to Charlotte, North Carolina and to the field of finance again in October 1998. He was also asked by North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt to head a task force on rural economic prosperity.

Senatorial races[edit]
Although initially reluctant to seek political office, Bowles reconsidered a run for the United States Senate after the September 11, 2001 attacks and, in October 2001, declared his candidacy for the Senate as a Democratic candidate. Seeking to fill the seat being vacated by Jesse Helms, Bowles secured the party's nomination, but was defeated in the 2002 general election by Republican contender Elizabeth Dole.
In 2004, Bowles campaigned again for the Senate, seeking to fill the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat John Edwards. He faced Republican Richard Burr and Libertarian Tom Bailey in a hotly contested race. The final month of the Senate campaign saw both Bowles's and Burr's campaigns turn strongly negative, with Burr's campaign attacking Bowles's associations with the Clinton administration, while Bowles's campaign attacked Burr on his support of trade legislation and special interest donations. Both campaigns spent a great deal of money, making it one of the most expensive statewide races in North Carolina history.
Despite an early lead in the polls after the primaries, as well as fellow Democrat Mike Easley running for a second term as governor at the top of the state party ticket, Bowles was defeated in the 2004 race as well. President Bush's comfortable electoral victory in North Carolina likely helped Burr considerably. During his concession speech in Raleigh at the Democratic headquarters, he thanked his supporters but seemed to indicate that he would not run for office again. Quoting his father, he said there were "many ways to add to the community woodpile" and that political office was only one of them. Accordingly, in 2005 Bowles accepted an appointment as United Nations Deputy Special Envoy for Tsunami-affected Countries, once again working for Bill Clinton who was now serving as U.N. Special Envoy.
Since 2005[edit]
On October 3, 2005, Bowles was elected by the University of North Carolina's Board of Governors to succeed Molly Corbett Broad as President of the system, even though some suggest that the Board of Governors broke the law in not holding public hearings in the hiring process.[4] One of his most significant appointments was that of Holden Thorp as the tenth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who resigned on September 17, 2012 in the wake of several athletics-related scandals.[5] Bowles also spoke at the campus memorial service in memory of slain student body president Eve Carson.
On February 12, 2010, Bowles announced his retirement from the UNC System.[6][7] Bowles was replaced by Thomas W. Ross.[8]
Bowles is also a member of the board of directors of General Motors, Morgan Stanley, Norfolk Southern Corporation,[9] and North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and serves on the North Carolina Advisory Board of DonorsChoose.
Bowles was appointed in 2010 to co-chair President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson.[2] The commission deadlocked, and the co-chairs' report on a policy for budget deficit reduction was not adopted by the Obama administration.[10] Surprised by the rejection, Bowles later stated he believed that Obama decided to abandon the report and let [incoming House Budget Chairman] Paul Ryan go first, and then he would look like the sensible guy in the game, based on advice from his political advisers and over the objections of his economic team.[10]
On September 7, 2011, Facebook, Inc. announced that it had named Bowles to its board.[11]
After North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue announced that she would not run for a second term in 2012, Bowles was mentioned as a possible candidate, and polling put him almost even with likely Republican nominee Pat McCrory. But on February 2, 2012, Bowles announced that he would not seek the governorship.[12]
On August 14, 2012, Bowles gave an interview with The Daily Caller where he asserted that he is not "backing away" from his praise of Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan. Said Bowles: “I think he's smart. I think he's intellectually curious. I think he is honest, straightforward and sincere. And I think he does have a serious budget out there — it doesn’t mean I agree with it by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm not going to act like I don't like him or that I don't have some real respect for him." Along with his praise of Ryan he also had criticism of the current government. Said Bowles: “The people of this country get it. They know that the fiscal path this country is on is not sustainable and that these deficits of over a trillion dollars a year are a cancer that in time will destroy our Country from within..." Despite his praise of Ryan, Bowles says he plans on voting for President Obama in November. “Who I vote for is my business, but I am certainly a registered Democrat and I’m proud to be so,” Bowles said in the phone interview. “And I certainly envision voting for the president for sure.” [13]

They know that the fiscal path this country is on is not sustainable and that these deficits of over a trillion dollars a year are a cancer that in time will destroy our Country from within..." Despite his praise of Ryan, Bowles says he plans on voting for President Obama in November. “Who I vote for is my business, but I am certainly a registered Democrat and I’m proud to be so,” Bowles said in the phone interview. “And I certainly envision voting for the president for sure.” [13]

Erskine Boyce Bowles (born August 8, 1945) is an American businessman and political figure from North Carolina. He served from 2005 to 2010[1] as the president of the University of North Carolina system. In 1997–98 he served as White House Chief of Staff and he also ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from North Carolina in 2002 and 2004.
In 2010 Bowles served as the Democratic co-chair of President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson.[2] Bowles and Simpson co-led a business group, The Campaign to Fix the Debt.[3]

Early life and education[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Bowles was born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina and is the son of Jessamine Woodward Boyce Bowles and the late Hargrove "Skipper" Bowles, Jr., a Democratic politician who ran unsuccessfully for Governor of North Carolina in 1972. Siblings include Hargrove Bowles III, Mary Holland Bowles Blanton and the late Martha Thomas Bowles. Bowles graduated from Virginia Episcopal School before attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity and graduated with a business degree. After briefly serving in the United States Coast Guard, Bowles then enrolled in Columbia Business School, where he earned an MBA.
Following graduation, Bowles worked for the financial firm Morgan Stanley in New York City, where he met his future wife, Crandall Close. The two married in 1971 and moved to North Carolina, where Bowles worked on his father's 1972 gubernatorial campaign. Crandall and Erskine have three children: Sam, Annie, and Bill. In 1975, Bowles helped launch the investment banking firm of Bowles Hollowell Conner, and remained in the corporate sector until the 1990s.
The Clinton years[edit]
In 1992, he became more involved in politics as a fundraiser for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. President Clinton appointed Bowles to head the Small Business Administration in 1993. From October 1994 to December 1995, Bowles served as Clinton's White House Deputy Chief of Staff, in the first term of the Clinton Administration.
After briefly returning to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he helped found the private equity firm Carousel Capital, Bowles was appointed Clinton's Chief of Staff in December 1996. One of Bowles's major responsibilities was dealing with federal budget negotiations between the White House and Congress. Bowles returned to Charlotte, North Carolina and to the field of finance again in October 1998. He was also asked by North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt to head a task force on rural economic prosperity.

Senatorial races[edit]
Although initially reluctant to seek political office, Bowles reconsidered a run for the United States Senate after the September 11, 2001 attacks and, in October 2001, declared his candidacy for the Senate as a Democratic candidate. Seeking to fill the seat being vacated by Jesse Helms, Bowles secured the party's nomination, but was defeated in the 2002 general election by Republican contender Elizabeth Dole.
In 2004, Bowles campaigned again for the Senate, seeking to fill the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat John Edwards. He faced Republican Richard Burr and Libertarian Tom Bailey in a hotly contested race. The final month of the Senate campaign saw both Bowles's and Burr's campaigns turn strongly negative, with Burr's campaign attacking Bowles's associations with the Clinton administration, while Bowles's campaign attacked Burr on his support of trade legislation and special interest donations. Both campaigns spent a great deal of money, making it one of the most expensive statewide races in North Carolina history.
Despite an early lead in the polls after the primaries, as well as fellow Democrat Mike Easley running for a second term as governor at the top of the state party ticket, Bowles was defeated in the 2004 race as well. President Bush's comfortable electoral victory in North Carolina likely helped Burr considerably. During his concession speech in Raleigh at the Democratic headquarters, he thanked his supporters but seemed to indicate that he would not run for office again. Quoting his father, he said there were "many ways to add to the community woodpile" and that political office was only one of them. Accordingly, in 2005 Bowles accepted an appointment as United Nations Deputy Special Envoy for Tsunami-affected Countries, once again working for Bill Clinton who was now serving as U.N. Special Envoy.
Since 2005[edit]
On October 3, 2005, Bowles was elected by the University of North Carolina's Board of Governors to succeed Molly Corbett Broad as President of the system, even though some suggest that the Board of Governors broke the law in not holding public hearings in the hiring process.[4] One of his most significant appointments was that of Holden Thorp as the tenth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who resigned on September 17, 2012 in the wake of several athletics-related scandals.[5] Bowles also spoke at the campus memorial service in memory of slain student body president Eve Carson.
On February 12, 2010, Bowles announced his retirement from the UNC System.[6][7] Bowles was replaced by Thomas W. Ross.[8]
Bowles is also a member of the board of directors of General Motors, Morgan Stanley, Norfolk Southern Corporation,[9] and North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and serves on the North Carolina Advisory Board of DonorsChoose.
Bowles was appointed in 2010 to co-chair President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson.[2] The commission deadlocked, and the co-chairs' report on a policy for budget deficit reduction was not adopted by the Obama administration.[10] Surprised by the rejection, Bowles later stated he believed that Obama decided to abandon the report and let [incoming House Budget Chairman] Paul Ryan go first, and then he would look like the sensible guy in the game, based on advice from his political advisers and over the objections of his economic team.[10]
On September 7, 2011, Facebook, Inc. announced that it had named Bowles to its board.[11]
After North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue announced that she would not run for a second term in 2012, Bowles was mentioned as a possible candidate, and polling put him almost even with likely Republican nominee Pat McCrory. But on February 2, 2012, Bowles announced that he would not seek the governorship.[12]
On August 14, 2012, Bowles gave an interview with The Daily Caller where he asserted that he is not "backing away" from his praise of Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan. Said Bowles: “I think he's smart. I think he's intellectually curious. I think he is honest, straightforward and sincere. And I think he does have a serious budget out there — it doesn’t mean I agree with it by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm not going to act like I don't like him or that I don't have some real respect for him." Along with his praise of Ryan he also had criticism of the current government. Said Bowles: “The people of this country get it. They know that the fiscal path this country is on is not sustainable and that these deficits of over a trillion dollars a year are a cancer that in time will destroy our Country from within..." Despite his praise of Ryan, Bowles says he plans on voting for President Obama in November. “Who I vote for is my business, but I am certainly a registered Democrat and I’m proud to be so,” Bowles said in the phone interview. “And I certainly envision voting for the president for sure.” [13]

Erskine Boyce Bowles (born August 8, 1945) is an American businessman and political figure from North Carolina. He served from 2005 to 2010[1] as the president of the University of North Carolina system. In 1997–98 he served as White House Chief of Staff and he also ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from North Carolina in 2002 and 2004.
In 2010 Bowles served as the Democratic co-chair of President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson.[2] Bowles and Simpson co-led a business group, The Campaign to Fix the Debt.[3]

Early life and education[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Bowles was born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina and is the son of Jessamine Woodward Boyce Bowles and the late Hargrove "Skipper" Bowles, Jr., a Democratic politician who ran unsuccessfully for Governor of North Carolina in 1972. Siblings include Hargrove Bowles III, Mary Holland Bowles Blanton and the late Martha Thomas Bowles. Bowles graduated from Virginia Episcopal School before attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity and graduated with a business degree. After briefly serving in the United States Coast Guard, Bowles then enrolled in Columbia Business School, where he earned an MBA.
Following graduation, Bowles worked for the financial firm Morgan Stanley in New York City, where he met his future wife, Crandall Close. The two married in 1971 and moved to North Carolina, where Bowles worked on his father's 1972 gubernatorial campaign. Crandall and Erskine have three children: Sam, Annie, and Bill. In 1975, Bowles helped launch the investment banking firm of Bowles Hollowell Conner, and remained in the corporate sector until the 1990s.
The Clinton years[edit]
In 1992, he became more involved in politics as a fundraiser for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. President Clinton appointed Bowles to head the Small Business Administration in 1993. From October 1994 to December 1995, Bowles served as Clinton's White House Deputy Chief of Staff, in the first term of the Clinton Administration.
After briefly returning to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he helped found the private equity firm Carousel Capital, Bowles was appointed Clinton's Chief of Staff in December 1996. One of Bowles's major responsibilities was dealing with federal budget negotiations between the White House and Congress. Bowles returned to Charlotte, North Carolina and to the field of finance again in October 1998. He was also asked by North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt to head a task force on rural economic prosperity.

Senatorial races[edit]
Although initially reluctant to seek political office, Bowles reconsidered a run for the United States Senate after the September 11, 2001 attacks and, in October 2001, declared his candidacy for the Senate as a Democratic candidate. Seeking to fill the seat being vacated by Jesse Helms, Bowles secured the party's nomination, but was defeated in the 2002 general election by Republican contender Elizabeth Dole.
In 2004, Bowles campaigned again for the Senate, seeking to fill the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat John Edwards. He faced Republican Richard Burr and Libertarian Tom Bailey in a hotly contested race. The final month of the Senate campaign saw both Bowles's and Burr's campaigns turn strongly negative, with Burr's campaign attacking Bowles's associations with the Clinton administration, while Bowles's campaign attacked Burr on his support of trade legislation and special interest donations. Both campaigns spent a great deal of money, making it one of the most expensive statewide races in North Carolina history.
Despite an early lead in the polls after the primaries, as well as fellow Democrat Mike Easley running for a second term as governor at the top of the state party ticket, Bowles was defeated in the 2004 race as well. President Bush's comfortable electoral victory in North Carolina likely helped Burr considerably. During his concession speech in Raleigh at the Democratic headquarters, he thanked his supporters but seemed to indicate that he would not run for office again. Quoting his father, he said there were "many ways to add to the community woodpile" and that political office was only one of them. Accordingly, in 2005 Bowles accepted an appointment as United Nations Deputy Special Envoy for Tsunami-affected Countries, once again working for Bill Clinton who was now serving as U.N. Special Envoy.
Since 2005[edit]
On October 3, 2005, Bowles was elected by the University of North Carolina's Board of Governors to succeed Molly Corbett Broad as President of the system, even though some suggest that the Board of Governors broke the law in not holding public hearings in the hiring process.[4] One of his most significant appointments was that of Holden Thorp as the tenth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who resigned on September 17, 2012 in the wake of several athletics-related scandals.[5] Bowles also spoke at the campus memorial service in memory of slain student body president Eve Carson.
On February 12, 2010, Bowles announced his retirement from the UNC System.[6][7] Bowles was replaced by Thomas W. Ross.[8]
Bowles is also a member of the board of directors of General Motors, Morgan Stanley, Norfolk Southern Corporation,[9] and North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and serves on the North Carolina Advisory Board of DonorsChoose.
Bowles was appointed in 2010 to co-chair President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson.[2] The commission deadlocked, and the co-chairs' report on a policy for budget deficit reduction was not adopted by the Obama administration.[10] Surprised by the rejection, Bowles later stated he believed that Obama decided to abandon the report and let [incoming House Budget Chairman] Paul Ryan go first, and then he would look like the sensible guy in the game, based on advice from his political advisers and over the objections of his economic team.[10]
On September 7, 2011, Facebook, Inc. announced that it had named Bowles to its board.[11]
After North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue announced that she would not run for a second term in 2012, Bowles was mentioned as a possible candidate, and polling put him almost even with likely Republican nominee Pat McCrory. But on February 2, 2012, Bowles announced that he would not seek the governorship.[12]
On August 14, 2012, Bowles gave an interview with The Daily Caller where he asserted that he is not "backing away" from his praise of Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan. Said Bowles: “I think he's smart. I think he's intellectually curious. I think he is honest, straightforward and sincere. And I think he does have a serious budget out there — it doesn’t mean I agree with it by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm not going to act like I don't like him or that I don't have some real respect for him." Along with his praise of Ryan he also had criticism of the current government. Said Bowles: “The people of this country get it. They know that the fiscal path this country is on is not sustainable and that these deficits of over a trillion dollars a year are a cancer that in time will destroy our Country from within..." Despite his praise of Ryan, Bowles says he plans on voting for President Obama in November. “Who I vote for is my business, but I am certainly a registered Democrat and I’m proud to be so,” Bowles said in the phone interview. “And I certainly envision voting for the president for sure.” [13]

When President Clinton summoned his Vice President, his chief of staff and his chief of staff-to-be to join him on a small platform in the East Room of the White House today, he gestured to the gold carpet behind him and said, ''No particular order.''Erskine B. Bowles, the reedy, owlish North Carolina businessman whom Mr. Clinton has pressed into service to lead the White House into a second term, moved instinctively to the background. That is the spot Mr. Bowles grew used to as a deputy chief of staff for 15 months until he left last December to return to the private sector.''We're two Southern guys,'' Mr. Bowles said in an interview last spring, summing up his bond with his boss. ''I didn't want anything. I didn't talk to reporters. I came from a world where your relationship with your clients was confidential and he was my only client. I think he felt comfortable that I could listen.''Now he will be front and center in one of the most visible, high-pressure jobs in the country. Mr. Bowles, a multimillionaire investment banker and 1992 fund-raiser who went on to become head of the Small Business Administration and then the President's golfing partner, time manager and trusted friend, will not only have to listen but also to talk. And he will have dozens of demanding constituents, from senators to Cabinet secretaries to anchormen.

Yet if most of those who saw the East Room ceremony on television today were hearing Mr. Bowles's voice for the first time, few who know him seem to think he will have much trouble adjusting to the task. Continue reading the main story

''A grand slam,'' said Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, who once upon a time in 1992 aspired to the job himself. ''He is tremendously loyal, but it's a loyalty that promotes candor and straight talk. At the same time, he's very graceful and gracious, which can't be overestimated when you're in a caldron like the White House.''Mr. Clinton himself said he turned to Mr. Bowles, whom he has described as his best friend in the White House, because he wanted ''someone of stature, intellect, dedication, drive, and the capacity to do this virtually impossible job.''Mr. Clinton's first chief of staff was his childhood friend, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, who was widely regarded as nice but ineffectual, and the President eased him out in the summer of 1994 in favor of Leon E. Panetta, a former Congressman from California. Mr. Panetta brought new discipline to the staff, but wanted to return to California to contemplate a run for governor.Mr. Bowles, 51, is a far closer, locker-room pal, one Mr. Clinton has relied on for delicate tasks, from telling Dick Morris that he had to resign as the Clinton campaign's political strategist after reports in August that he had a relationship with a prostitute, to overseeing the President's preparation for campaign debates this fall.He has long been the President's first choice to succeed Mr. Panetta, but he had to be persuaded, having just last January started a merchant banking concern that specializes in buying mid-sized companies on behalf of investors. Mr. Bowles agreed to rejoin the Administration in a phone conversation Thursday night.In a brief interview, Mr. Bowles said today that his partners had agreed to buy him out. He said he had told Mr. Clinton that he ''wanted to have some input'' in choosing his own team, in part because he wants people to compensate for his own inexperience in dealing with Congress. Other White House aides said that was a polite way of saying that Mr. Panetta's two deputies, Harold M. Ickes and Evelyn Lieberman, would almost certainly not stay on.As co-deputy chief of staff with Mr. Bowles under Mr. Panetta, Mr. Ickes served as political strategist and ambassador to Democratic constituency groups, while Mr. Bowles oversaw internal administration and the President's time. The two made a good team but have little in common.

Mr. Bowles is no stranger to politics. He comes from a prominent North Carolina family and his late father, Hargrove Bowles was the Democratic candidate for governor of North Carolina in 1972. His wife, Crandall Close Bowles, is the sister of Elliot S. Close, who lost his challenge to Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina this week.

The Closes are descendants of the family that founded Springs Industries, the South Carolina textile giant that makes Springmaid and Wamsutta sheets, and Mrs. Bowles is the company's executive vice president and head of its bath division and a candidate for the top job one day. Company records show that she is a millionaire many times over. She was a Wellesley College classmate of Hillary Rodham Clinton's.Mr. Bowles, who graduated from the University of North Carolina and holds an M.B.A. from Columbia University, met Crandall Close when they worked at Morgan Stanley & Company in New York in the early 1970's. He left in 1975 to found Bowles, Hollowell, Conner & Company, a regional investment bank in Charlotte, where Mr. Bowles made another, smaller fortune of his own.At the ceremony today, Mr. Bowles warmly thanked his family for their support as ''we together have reached this enormous decision for me to once again return to Washington and leave my family behind in North Carolina.'' In a sign of the separations to come, neither his wife nor any of their three college-age children could be there; all were grounded by bad weather and unable to fly to Washington.Mr. Bowles had not known Mr. Clinton before the 1992 campaign, when he helped raised about $1.5 million for Mr. Clinton's campaign. But they formed a strong bond over Mr. Bowles's son Sam, who suffers from diabetes. In a car one day after a campaign event, Mr. Bowles, then the president of the national Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, complained about President George Bush's ban on fetal tissue research, which could hold hope for a cure.Mr. Clinton paid little overt attention at the time, Mr. Bowles recalled last spring, but in a speech a short while later, told the story of Sam Bowles, promised to end the ban if elected, then did so and sent Sam the pen he used to sign the order.Named by Mr. Clinton to head the Small Business Administration, Mr. Bowles streamlined loan applications and other programs and received high marks for managing the agency. He came to the White House in 1994, bonding further with the President as he helped Mr. Panetta control access to the Oval Office and carve out more free time for the President to think, write and plan.Mr. Bowles has a reputation as a polite perfectionist who is quick with praise, but also demanding. He used to advise anyone who showed up for an 8 A.M. meeting at 8:05 that they need not bother.''I think he's more interested in people respecting him than in liking him,'' said one senior White House aide who both likes and respects him, ''and the way he deals with people is very up-front.''
