Memberrulleinnernet — Developer11 months 16 days agoWhat the Sweden Can Learn From Indian and Southeast Asian Mobile Companies?
0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoSweden has been a hotbed of tech innovation, from Spotify to King. But due to the small population, most of the success has been driven by consumer adoption outside of Sweden. So Swedish startups need to be global from day 1 and adapt and localize their growth and marketing strategy. Gaming is one interesting example, most of King’s and Majong’s adoption has been in EU and North America, even though SEA is one of the largest gaming markets outside of China. That’s because the strategy in SEA hasn’t been adaptive. And so local players like Touchten and Garena dominate the… Read more »1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧AdmineakinseyMarketer11 months 15 days agoHey Ravi! Great to have you on the Growth Chat; really appreciate you taking the time! I think about this a lot as we’re creating community events for devs and marketers/PMs focused on mobile growth across the world, and am interested in your perspective – what are the top differences between mobile in India and Southeast Asia and the US?
0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoIndia and SEA (especially Indonesia, which is the largest market in this region) are mobile-first, and have the fastest growing smartphone adoption across the world. Unlike US, a majority of the users are leapfrogging to the mobile and are accessing the internet for the first time through mobile. For a lot of internet companies we work with, mobile (including apps and web) drives more than 70% of the traffic, and majority of the revenue as well (with some exceptions based on the categories). We don’t see the same with US-based companies. For a good number of US-based internet companies, desktop… Read more »2  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧MembertoddpattonMarketer11 months 15 days agoHi! In terms of eCommerce, are mobile purchases common?  If not, do people at least research on mobile, or are most purchases still made on desktop?
1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoTodd, thanks for asking. Given the mobile-first nature of the market, mobile purchases are indeed very common so much so that India’s largest fashion e-tailer, Myntra, had decided to shut their desktop presence completely and focus on the mobile apps a year back (It’s a different story that they have relaunched the desktop site recently to enable better discovery of fashion). When they had shut down, I think their initial impact was about 15%, which they planned to compensate with the life-time revenue of the app users. As per widely reported numbers, as much as 70% of the e-commerce transactions… Read more »1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧MembercynthiachiangMarketer11 months 15 days agoHi Ravi! Thanks for doing the growth chat. My question is – are smart mobile devices commonly used in Southeast Asia and India yet? What would you say is the adaption rate? Android or iOS?
1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoSEA is not a monolithic market, since there’s so much diversity in terms of socio-economic and political realities. On one hand you have Singapore with one of the highest income per capita in the world. As such iOS is pretty much a majority of all phones. On the other extreme, you have Vietnam, dominated by Android, mostly with phones by Chinese manufacturers where iOS is pretty much non-existent because of both socio-economic reasons and political regulations. As such you really can’t chose one platform or the other if you are serious about SEA. You have to be on iOS, Android,… Read more »1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoWelcome to the Growth chat folks, happy to answer questions.

Most mobile companies will think of India in their growth strategy but are at a lost when it concerns Southeast Asian. What countries/cities do you see being the tech hubs there? How should growth hackers approach them?
0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoHey Govind, thanks for asking. I think this thought process is changing for sure. The fundamentals are already there in SEA, especially in countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Indonesia, a country of 250m for example has close to 60% internet penetration and almost 300 mobile connections; and double the GDP per capita of India. And now investors and companies realize the importance of SEA. Just some recent events illustrate this: Alibaba buying a majority of Lazada (SEA’s largest ecommerce company) at 1.5 billion dollar valuation, Go-Jek raising > 500 m from the likes of KKR at 1B+ valuation, Grab’s… Read more »1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧MembergpiattStudent — Other11 months 15 days agoHi Ravi! Thanks for doing this. Is there a strong developer base in India and Southeast Asia, or is it mostly end consumers?
0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoWhile it’s a common notion that India is an end-consumer market, given the very nature of complex local challenges, we see a strong community of developers working on solving these challenges and at the same time, applying these learnings in other parts of the world. We have also seen emergence of a number of product based startups in the recent past which are going truly global like Robosoft, Freshdesk. When compared to India, most of Southeast Asia’s developer talent is still emerging. With one exception, Vietnam. Vietnamese developers are some of the best talent out there. Most regional companies in… Read more »1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Memberchart3Hart Services — Marketer11 months 15 days agoHi Ravi.  Have you ever run CPI (cost per install) mobile app download campaigns?  If so, which traffic sources or mobile traffic networks worked best for your CPI campaigns?
0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoWe at MoEngage don’t run download campaigns for our customers, however I did when I was running my previous startup, DelightCircle. At DelightCircle (which was three years back), we tried various ad-networks to drive installs, Facebook Mobile Install ads were the best in terms of ROI driving quality installs, followed by Google. In my conversations with our customers at MoEngage, they gave the same feedback in terms of quality of users, however Facebook Mobile Install Ads have become a lot more expensive. So, companies try multiple ad-networks including Facebook, Google, Inmobi, etc. and some of them drive quantity and some… Read more »1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Adminmada299Mobile Growth Community  — Marketer11 months 15 days agoHow important is the localization? Will english marketing materials work, or is it super important to get a local?
0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoIn India, English works perfectly fine. We do see a lot of messages and promotions tailored to the local audience but the communication still happens in English broadly. When it comes to SEA, it’s very important to localize. English will work early on for the very top end of the market. But if you go one layer down, localization becomes important. On the positive side, unlike in India where you have innumerable number of languages and dialect, which has made english the glue. In most countries in SEA one language dominates. So Bahasa Indonesian in Indonesia, Bahasha Malaysian in Malaysia,… Read more »1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧MemberkatebradyMarketer11 months 15 days agoThanks for sharing your insights! What do you suggest is an ideal order to penetrate the SEA market? Singapore first?
0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoIt depends on the business. If you are a US based company, Singapore is a natural transition country. It’s much more similar to western markets, than to other countries in SEA. So Singapore as a hub works well for most companies. But the next choice will depend. Indonesia is a natural choice considering its huge population and tech penetration. It’s a massive market! But Indonesia also takes time and patience, since market is quite unique in and of itself. Somewhere in the middle is Thailand, easier to build a base but you will hit a ceiling relatively early in terms… Read more »1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧Authorraviteja2007MoEngage Inc. — Marketer11 months 15 days agoThanks everyone for your questions, hope the answers will be of help.
