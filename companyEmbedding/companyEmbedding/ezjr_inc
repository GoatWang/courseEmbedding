Obtains Trademark and Other Assets in Exchange for Preferred and Common Stock

LAS VEGAS, NV--(NewMediaWire - Nov 29, 2016) - EZJR, Inc. (OTCQB: EZJR) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to obtain the exclusive U.S. rights to the Her Imports trademark. In exchange for these rights the Company has issued to Cabello Real Ltd, the holder of the rights $10 million of unregistered callable preferred stock and 15,000,000 unregistered common stock in EZJR. In addition to these rights, EZJR also purchased certain other assets owned by Cabello including customer lists and various digital content. Simultaneously, EZJR has terminated its Marketing and Selling Agreement with Her Holding Inc. Because of this termination EZJR will recognize a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $1.3 million due to the write-off an intangible asset related to restricted common shares issued to Her Holdings as part of a royalty reduction agreement and forgiveness of certain advances to Her Holdings. It is understood that Cabello will continue to develop Her Imports stores outside of the United States including Canada, Europe and Africa.
Barry Hall, EZJR's CEO stated, "This agreement is a natural evolution of our business related to the Her Imports brand. We now intend to leverage this new asset with an aggressive three-year store and internet expansion program. Additionally, by eliminating the royalties currently paid to Her Holdings, we will immediately improve our financial performance and cash flow." Hall added, "The Her Imports brand is synonymous with high-quality hair extensions. We believe that we can use this to reputation expand our product line to other beauty products targeted at the urban fashion market."
About EZJR, Inc.
EZJR's primary business is to improve the sales performance of brands, products and services by way of our proprietary eCommerce platform and strategic leverage of social media buys. Our unique methodology minimizes the cost of generating leads and then maximizes the conversion of those leads into customers.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

EZJR, Inc. Purchases Exclusive U.S. Rights to Her Imports Trademark



/EINPresswire.com/ -- Obtains Trademark and Other Assets in Exchange for Preferred and Common Stock

LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - Nov 29, 2016) -  EZJR, Inc. (OTCQB: EZJR) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to obtain the exclusive U.S. rights to the Her Imports trademark. In exchange for these rights the Company has issued to Cabello Real Ltd, the holder of the rights $10 million of unregistered callable preferred stock and 15,000,000 unregistered common stock in EZJR. In addition to these rights, EZJR also purchased certain other assets owned by Cabello including customer lists and various digital content. Simultaneously, EZJR has terminated its Marketing and Selling Agreement with Her Holding Inc. Because of this termination EZJR will recognize a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $1.3 million due to the write-off an intangible asset related to restricted common shares issued to Her Holdings as part of a royalty reduction agreement and forgiveness of certain advances to Her Holdings. It is understood that Cabello will continue to develop Her Imports stores outside of the United States including Canada, Europe and Africa.
Barry Hall, EZJR's CEO stated, "This agreement is a natural evolution of our business related to the Her Imports brand. We now intend to leverage this new asset with an aggressive three-year store and internet expansion program. Additionally, by eliminating the royalties currently paid to Her Holdings, we will immediately improve our financial performance and cash flow." Hall added, "The Her Imports brand is synonymous with high-quality hair extensions. We believe that we can use this to reputation expand our product line to other beauty products targeted at the urban fashion market."

Updates Shareholders on Recent DevelopmentsMarketwiredJune 17, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareSUWANEE, GA--(Marketwired - Jun 17, 2014) -  EZJR, Inc. (  OTCQB :  EZJR ), is an online Service Provider to the consumer credit industry. The Company is pleased to provide this strategic direction update to its shareholders, and discuss the recent acquisition of an innovative software system and the vital role it will play in the current and future growth of the Company. EZJR is committed to maintaining open lines of communication with its current and potential shareholders, and is excited to share more details with the investing public regarding recent corporate developments that have positioned the Company for solid growth."Thus far, 2014 has been a transitional year for EZJR, as we have modified our corporate model from one-time revenue sources to subscription services that generate increased revenue over time," commented Ed Zimbardi, CEO of EZJR.Previously, EZJR generated consumer data and sold that information to the various service providers ("SP's"). This model proved limited in the amount and ways in which the Company could earn revenues. As the Company developed various strategic and business relationships they were able to move away from that one-time sale model beginning with the strategic acquisition of consumer advocate Leading Edge Financial ("LEF")."The acquisition of LEF provides the opportunity to significantly increase our operating margins, as we can now provide subscription services that generate revenues over a period of time rather than just once. With the implementation of this new model, we are able to cultivate personal relationships with our customers, rather than simply generating data and passing it along to the SP's who enjoyed the true value of the customer. We now have the opportunity to both upsell and down-sell our customers a variety of products. In order to accomplish this, we had to significantly upgrade our customer facing software and establish relationships with other service providers, resulting in a comprehensive retail credit-centric package," Mr. Zimbardi went on to say.Credit plays an important role in every person's life: one needs good credit to secure many jobs, to make major consumer purchases, to obtain reasonable insurance rates, and even to rent an apartment or home. As the role of credit has increased in the importance of our lives, it is more crucial than ever for consumers to manage, monitor, and improve their credit scores. EZJR has created a comprehensive credit management and monitoring diagnostic suite of tools for the consumer.The Company's credit monitoring service, CredEze, offers members with the most comprehensive identity theft detection, protection and fraud resolution assistance currently on the market. Alert programs have been designed to protect consumers from the damages that are caused by identity and credit theft. CredEze monitors each member's credit daily through all three of the major credit bureaus, and immediately alerts members of unusual activity."We are excited to finally be at this point in our development. With our suite of credit related products firmly in place, we can now market our services directly to the consumer. In this regard, our proprietary suite of products gives consumers very specific sources of credit point reductions or additions, and offers advised actions. This gives us a strategic advantage over other credit management system currently in the marketplace," stated Zimbardi.The LEF credit management product shows positive and negative information on users' credit reports, which is in turn analyzed and calculated to show the consumer how many points are being deducted from -- or added to -- their overall credit score. Customers are provided with a better understanding of the weight each account carries. Recommendations and scenarios are then given to the customers to achieve short and long-term goals. EZJR's new CRM system provides significant enhancements to the customer experience, while allowing the Company to optimize lead flow and seamlessly process large amounts of customer data.The Company's newly integrated marketing team has begun developing and market testing an aggressive online and digital marketing initiative aimed at bringing awareness to our consumer offerings and educating customers about their options when it comes to managing their credit. "We believe that we can increase client engagement and retention through this initiative with the assistance of our new Customer Relationship Management ('CRM') software," Zimbardi said.Read More"In closing, I would like to say that we are extremely proud to be in a position to share such important developments with our shareholders. We believe that we have all of the components in place to be become a leader in our industry," said Zimbardi.About EZJR, Inc.
