Dr. Debra B. Morton is the much admired and beloved Senior Pastor of the Greater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist Church in New Orleans, Louisiana and the Co-Pastor of Changing A Generation Full Gospel Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia.  She works diligently in the service of the Lord with her husband, Bishop Paul S. Morton, Sr., Presiding Bishop of the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship International (FGBCFI). Dr. Morton also serves as General Overseer of the women’s division and daughters of the promise (DOP) of the (FGBCFI). As General Overseer, she oversees and ministers to more than 20,000 women annually.  It was Dr. Morton’s founding of the Women of Excellence Ministry (WOE) in 1987 that most profoundly expanded her sphere of influence far beyond the local pastorate. As founder of WOE for over 15 years, Dr. Morton nurtured thousands of women. As a result of WOE, many pastors, entrepreneurs, teachers, etc. were birthed. 

In 1993, Debra B. Morton was ordained as an Elder.  She thereby earned the ground-breaking distinction as one of the first ordained female elders to preach in the Baptist pulpit. Dr. Morton hosted weekly an early morning television and radio talk shows, “Morning Coffee,” where discussions of everyday life were infused with spiritual application. Locally her radio show gained much popularity as did her TV nationally, on the Word Television Network – as Dr. Morton proclaimed: “Jesus is better than a good cup of coffee; He is Lord.” 
In 1999, Dr. Morton received her Doctor of Ministry degree from Friends International Christian University.
She has written six books to date:
·         “Help, Lord, My Husband Has Two Wives”
·         “Morning Coffee” Volumes I and II, a daily prayer journal with scriptures 
           and reflections that inspire conversations with God"
·         “The New Millennium Question: Where is the Lord God of Elijah?”
·         “Seize Opportunity”:  It’s Your Season!
·         “I’m in Love with My Pastor BUT He Still Has “Two Wives”!  
To add to her many accomplishments, as the Executive Producer of the hit album, “Where There Is A Will There Is A Way,” featuring the WOE Mass Choir, Dr. Morton was nominated for a prestigious Stellar Award and received the James Cleveland Award from Gospel Truth Magazine in Las Vegas. She also wrote two songs on the (FGBCFI) Daughters of the Promise project.
In October 2002, Debra B. Morton, along with WOE, opened SpaNobia, a full-service day spa-salon that reflected the standards of God’s excellency of which both the organization and its founder embrace.
In spite of the catastrophic devastation of Hurricane Katrina, Dr. Morton was able to help her husband rebuild the Ministry in New Orleans, Louisiana and expand to Atlanta, Georgia. There she was project manager for the renovation of the new Atlanta edifice.
 A new fragrance line, “Blessings in a Bottle” was launched by Dr. Morton. Some of the proceeds will go to help benefit the House of Promise – a home for troubled teen girls.
 Dr. Morton takes the greatest pride in these:  her personal relationship with Jesus Christ, her role as wife, mother of her three children – Jasmine, Paul Jr., and Christiann – and grandmother to little Elvin Ross, Jr. and London Paul Ross.
Her eternal goal is to tear down the Kingdom of darkness as she prophetically brings light to all who will hear her.

Paul De Bra




Paul De Bra's personal website



 
        (Photo taken at a lighthouse on the Hudson river around 1988.
        Click here for a more recent photo.)
      
My main activities are: 

        Job: I'm a (full) professor in computer
        science at the Eindhoven University of
        Technology with this professional website
Photography: Many public and private images are served by Zenfolio.
Music: This is my most intense hobby, consisting of conducting,
        playing and arranging music.

Until 2014 I was conductor of the accordion orchestra
            Avanti.
I play the piano, piano-accordion, button accordion (C-griff),
            accordina and bass accordion and am a member of Accordeana (in Helmond) and the Nederlands Symfonisch AccordeonOrkest.
            I also play in the accordion quintet ARTE, with enthusiastic
            accordion players from the Eindhoven region, and the accordion
	    quintet Kwintissimo with enthusiastic accordion players from all over the Netherlands.
I arrange all types of music for acordion and accordion
            orchestra and sometimes also compose something myself. All my arrangements are freely available from this site.
I also tune (and repair) accordions. I simply cannot stand it
            when my (or someone else's) accordion is out of tune so I have
            learned to tune accordions (many thanks to Henk Vos).

3D printing: When something breaks and it can be fixed with a
        plastic part I design it and print on my Makerbot or my FlashForge Creator Pro.
