Testosterone therapy can help both men and women treat symptoms that emerge as a result of aging and reduces its effects.









BHRT aids in maintaining hormone levels that have decreased due to declining hormone levels as we age.









Sermorelin is a synthetically crafted protein chain that stimulates the release of natural growth hormone to fight the signs of aging.













Welcome to North Dallas Wellness Center
Just because you are getting older doesn’t mean you have to feel old.
Many of the symptoms we have come to accept as just a part of aging may be caused by nutritional, hormonal, metabolic, or growth hormone deficiencies. If you are suffering from symptoms related to a deficiency of any of these issues, age-management treatment can help.
With years of experience, Dr. David Fein is an expert in anti-aging strategies, including nutritional, vitamin and supplement therapy, weight management, and bio-identical hormone therapies, utilizing injectable, pellet, and trans-dermal options. Dr. Fein uses laboratory testing and physical evaluation to assess your current hormone levels and address your symptoms with a customized treatment plan.
This thorough evaluation may uncover untreated medical issues or hormone deficiencies such as:

Low or absent testosterone
Estrogen or progesterone deficiencies
Undiagnosed hypothyroidism
Low cortisol levels or “adrenal fatigue”
Low vitamin B6, vitamin B12, or vitamin D
DHEA-S deficiencies

Anti-Aging Therapies Can Help:


Restore Sexual Desire
Improve Sexual Function

Increase Lean Muscle
Reduce Body Fat
Increase Bone Density
Reduce Stress
Lower Cholesterol
Lower Blood Pressure
Accelerate Healing
