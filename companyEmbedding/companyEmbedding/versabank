Versabank: Insiders Buying A Conservative Bank Trading At Half Book - Versabank (OTCMKTS:VRRKF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Versabank: Insiders Buying A Conservative Bank Trading At Half BookJul.27.17 | About: Versabank (VRRKF) Coastal Investing Long only, value, macro, micro-capSummaryVersabank is a microcap Canadian bank trading at slightly more than 50% of book value.Conservatively leveraged, with no impaired loans and almost zero residential mortgage exposure.Numerous insiders making repeated buys in the last couple months. I find the markets a little frustrating at the moment. There's no shortage of articles and headlines discussing the relatively high valuations we find ourselves at, with a corresponding lack of bargains available.  There's also an extra dose of worry about Canada. The housing market - many would say bubble - in Vancouver and Toronto looms large over the Canadian financial sector at the moment. Other contributors have suggested that Canadian Imperial (CM) is trading at less than 9 times earnings right now while its peers are at 12 because of concerns over mortgage exposure. Well, let me tell you about a bank that is some 500 times smaller - but a lot cheaper, Versabank (OTC:VRRKF). With a market cap of something like 100 million (all figures Canadian), it doesn't even begin to raise a splash in financial circles. I like that. There's no way I can compete by looking at massive, liquid companies that a thousand other analysts know inside and out. I might as well buy an ETF.  Why do I own Versabank? It starts with the financial statements. VRRKF (or VB on the TSE) is really quite a traditional bank in some ways. It funds itself through brokered medium-interest deposits, lends them back out, and earns a spread. It doesn't bother with branches to minimize costs. Funds come directly from financial advisors recommending their GICs and other savings products. It turns those deposits around and makes loans to commercial contacts and real estate developers - not individual homeowners. It also believes it has a technological advantage in buying up portfolios of small loans, though it's hard to find details about what their comparative advantage might be here, and I struggle to believe that a company their size will have any ongoing software/tech advantage over the monoliths.  On average, it makes about 2.5% in NIM (the big banks make more like 1.75%), and as it continues to establish itself in the marketplace it's been able to expand that margin even in our low rate environment and while growing the total deposit base, as per the Q1 investor presentation: 

 This leads to a price/earnings ratio that right now sits at 6.1. That's cheap, but misleading, since the company has recently booked some serious deferred tax assets generated from its consolidation with Pacific and Western. Even if you throw those out completely, though, the P/E is around 15 in the most conservative case possible. That said, if you want to play it as safe as possible, 15 is a pretty high multiple for a Canadian bank. But what draws me to this firm is the value. Right now, the firm is trading for barely half of book value. If you sort Canadian stocks by book value, at a P/B around 0.5 you see a bunch of fringe resource companies that by and large are losing money. You don't see a bunch of stable, profit-making banks. How many chances are there to buy a profit-making company for half price? To go back to the CM example, there you're paying more like 1.75x book to get in the game.  Further, I'm not the only one who thinks this is a good buy. Director Patrick George has snapped up at least 75,000 shares on a May/June spree. Vice President Jean-Paul Martin Beker bought some on July 21st. Director Arnold Hillier was buying in July too. And Chairman Tom Hockin. And Senior VP Ross Duggan. That's a bit of a stampede of insiders, all in the same direction. And were you worried about the Canadian housing market? Let me quote the last MD&A: "Under OSFI’s definition, the Bank’s exposure to residential mortgages at April 30, 2017 totalled $617,000 compared to $627,000 at the end of the last quarter and $658,000 a year ago. The Bank did not have any HELOC’s outstanding at April 30, 2017, at the end of the previous quarter or a year ago." Less than a million dollars of exposure. Further, the bank hasn't had a single impaired loan in years.  There is real-estate exposure here but it's short-term and commercial. Loans are extended to development companies before construction and repaid after construction completes and the units are sold. The bank does not, as far as I can ascertain, hold long-term loans that are secured by physical real estate, but against the assets of development companies while construction is underway. Want to double down on the safety element? Look at the leverage - capital divided by exposure - 10.1% in the last quarter, while the big Canadian banks tend to bounce around between 4-5%. That is, Versabank is funding operations with approximately twice as much capital (less risky) relative to debt as its competitors.  

 On the other side, as pointed out in a February National Post column, if they decide to lever up a little more, contingent on regulatory permission, that could easily goose returns or result in a return of capital to shareholders. That's one way this story could turn out to be profitable. Another is if they just get snapped up. At their size, there's no shortage of larger players that might want them. But even absent an immediate catalyst, I have to imagine that the equity has to close some of the gap to book as long as they keep making profits, something which doesn't seem to be an issue - higher interest rates through monetary policy won't hurt that either. Further, the MD&A point out that the bank is actively forgoing some opportunities to deploy funds to higher-margin areas. There's no shortage of business.  Overall, Versabank checks all the boxes for me. It's a sustainable, growing business making good profits. It's trading for a touch more than book value at a reasonable multiple, and insiders are buying it up at every opportunity. There's no guarantee in the market, but the risk-reward looks compelling.

VersaBank, formerly Pacific & Western Bank of Canada, is a Canadian chartered bank that was founded in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1980 as a trust company. It later moved its head offices to London, Ontario,[1] and on August 1, 2002, it was granted a Schedule I Canadian chartered bank licence by the Canadian federal government, the first in approximately 18 years. The bank is publicly traded as VB on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
VersaBank is a branchless financial institution, choosing to invest instead in a technology based platform. Entrepreneur and founder of the bank, David Taylor, designed the electronic branchless platform. Beginning in 1993, the existing Pacific & Western Bank, a small trust company with six branches and a need for capital investment, reconfigured itself into a branchless bank based on online banking. By 2013 the bank became Canada's tenth largest publicly traded bank when it began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[2] In 2017 the bank completed a revision of its ownership structure that included a merger with its largest stockholder, PWC Capital, reported to be "the first merger between a Schedule 1 bank and a holding company operating under the Canadian Business Corporations Act".[3][4]
The bank's deposits have been raised digitally by way of a comprehensive broker network situated throughout Canada.[5] In 2016, there were over 120 deposit broker firms raising its deposits, including many of the in-house brokerage firms of the big six Canadian banks. Its lending portfolio consists of commercial and corporate lending, real estate and development financing, and an innovative, state-of-the-art bulk purchase program. The bank's target market is well-established Canadian corporate entities.
In May 2016, the bank changed its name to VersaBank because Versa is the prefix for versatile and because Pacific & Western had little direct relevance given the bank’s national and virtual focus.[6]

How do Provisional Patent Applications Work?
Make sure you understand exactly how they work, keeping in mind they only last for 12 months and are only useful if you eventually convert it into a non-provisional patent app!
LEARN MORE ABOUT PROVISIONAL PATENT APPS









Should I request a patent search?
It's the first step before a patent application! First, you learn how patentable your invention may be. If it's not very patentable, don't waste time and money on a patent app. Second, it may help you increase your patentability. By seeing what is similar, you can improve your invention around other existing invention and increase patentability.

Competitors

Sorry, no analysis for VersaBank's competitors could be found in our database.

















Value
 Is VersaBank undervalued based on future cash flows and its price relative to the stock market?

Value is all about what a company is worth versus what price it is available for. If you went into a grocery store and all the bananas were on sale at half price, they could be considered undervalued.



INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS 

 It is not possible to calculate the future cash flow value for VersaBank. This is due to cash flow or dividend data being unavailable. The share price is $4.5.



PRICE RELATIVE TO MARKET 


We can also value a company based on what the stock market is willing to pay for it. This is similar to the price of fruit (e.g. Mangoes or Avacados) increasing when they are out of season, or how much your home is worth.
The amount the stock market is willing to pay for VersaBank's earnings, growth and assets is considered below, and whether this is a fair price.




Price based on past earnings

Are VersaBank's earnings available for a low price, and how does this compare to other companies in the same industry?


Good value based on earnings compared to the Banks industry average.

Good value based on earnings compared to the overall market.




Price based on expected Growth
Does VersaBank's expected growth come at a high price?


Information is not available.




Price based on value of assets
What value do investors place on VersaBank's assets?


Good value based on assets compared to the Banks industry average.







X
Value checks
We assess VersaBank's value by looking at:

Is the discounted cash flow value less than 20%, or 40% of the share price? (2 checks) (Click here or on bar chart for details of DCF calculation.)
Is the PE ratio less than the market average, and/ or less than the Banks industry average (and greater than 0)? (2 checks)
Is the PEG ratio within a reasonable range (0 to 1)? (1 check)
Is the PB ratio less than the Banks industry average (and greater than 0)? (1 check)
VersaBank has a total score of 3/6, see the detailed checks below.
Note: We use GAAP Earnings per Share in all our calculations including PE and PEG Ratio.
Note 2: PEG ratio is based on analysts EPS growth expectations in 1 year (0%).

Discounted cash flow (Dividend Discount Model)
The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for VersaBank is arrived at by discounting future dividends to their present value. This approach is used for finance firms where free cash flow is difficult to estimate (e.g. Banks/ Insurance firms).
If the firm does not pay the majority of its earnings out as a dividend this method will often arrive at a value significantly lower than the share price.
See our documentation to learn about this calculation.

Value of the stock
Value = Expected dividends per share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual growth rate)
$0 = ($0 / (8.69% - 2.33%)
Value per share: $0
Current discount (share price of $4.5): %

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 8.69% = 2.33% + (0.829 * 7.67%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered is used in the case of financial firms, but it is not adjusted for financial leverage like with non-finance firms. Therefore the average levered beta from comparable firms is used as the bottom-up beta. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Average Levered Beta from peers = 0.829
Levered Beta used in calculation = 0.829

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 2.33% is from the 10 year government bond rate in CA.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.














Future Performance
 How is VersaBank expected to perform in the next 1 to 3 years based on estimates from 1 analyst?
Future performance analysis is based on estimates from less than 3 analysts.


The future performance of a company is measured in the same way as past performance, by looking at estimated growth and how much profit it is expected to make.Future estimates come from professional analysts. Just like forecasting the weather, they don’t always get it right!

 Insufficient estimate data, unable to calculate 1 year growth expectation.





Past and Future Earnings per Share
The accuracy of the analysts who estimate the future performance data can be gauged below. We look back 3 years and see if they were any good at predicting what actually occured. We also show the highest and lowest estimates looking forward to see if there is a wide range.
