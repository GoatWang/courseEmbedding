Long/Short Equity

What is 'Long/Short Equity'
Long/short equity is an investing strategy of taking long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline. A long/short equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure, while profiting from stock gains in the long positions and price declines in the short positions. Although this may not always be the case, the strategy would be profitable on a net basis as long as the long positions generate more profit than the short positions, or the other way around. The long/short equity strategy is popular with hedge funds, many of which employ a market-neutral strategy where the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal.

BREAKING DOWN 'Long/Short Equity'
While many hedge funds also employ a long/short equity strategy with a long bias (such as 130/30, where long exposure is 130% and short exposure is 30%), comparatively fewer hedge funds employ a short bias to their long/short strategy.
Long/short equity strategies can be differentiated in a number of ways – by market geography (advanced economies, emerging markets, Europe, etc.), sector (energy, technology, etc.), investment philosophy (value or growth) and so on. An example of a long/short equity strategy with a broad mandate would be a global equity growth fund; an example of a relatively narrow mandate would be an emerging markets healthcare fund.
A popular variation of the long/short model is that of the “pair trade," which involves offsetting a long position on a stock with a short position on another stock in the same sector. For example, an investor in the technology space may take a long position in Microsoft and offset that with a short position in Intel. If the investor buys 1,000 shares of Microsoft at $33 each, and Intel is trading at $22, the short leg of this paired trade would involve purchasing 1,500 Intel shares so that the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal.
The ideal situation for this long/short strategy would be for Microsoft to appreciate and for Intel to decline. If Microsoft rises to $35 and Intel falls to $21, the overall profit on this strategy would be $3,500. Even if Intel advances to $23 – since the same factors typically drive stocks up or down in a specific sector – the strategy would still be profitable at $500, although much less so.
To get around the fact that stocks within a sector generally tend to move up or down in unison, long/short strategies frequently tend to use different sectors for the long and short legs. For example, if interest rates are rising, a hedge fund may short interest-sensitive sectors such as utilities, and go long on defensive sectors such as health care.

                    The funds may not be suitable for all investors. Certain funds may be affected by risks that include those associated
                    with sector concentration, international investing, investing in small and/or medium size companies, and/or the Funds'
                    possible use of investment techniques and strategies such as leverage, derivatives and short sales of securities and
                    alternative or nontraditional asset classes and strategies such as absolute return, long/short, commodities, currencies
                    and managed futures. Investments in fixed-income securities are subject to the possibility that interest rates could rise,
                    causing the value of the Funds' securities and share price to decline. Please see the Funds' prospectus for more information.
                    Shares of the Funds are not deposits of,
                    or guaranteed or endorsed by, any financial institution; are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),
                    the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency; and involve risk, including the possible loss of the principal amount
                    invested. Diversification neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses.
                

                    The Alternative Funds may not be suitable for all investors because of the sophisticated and aggressive investment
                    techniques the funds employ, such as leverage, derivatives and short selling. Click a fund name above or see a prospectus
                    for additional details on these and other risks.
                


                        Inverse and leveraged Funds are not suitable for all investors. •These Funds should be utilized only by investors who (a)
                        understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, (b) understand the consequences of seeking daily
                        leveraged investment results, (c) understand the risk of shorting, and (d) intend to actively monitor and manage their investments.
                    
                    •The more a Fund invests in leveraged instruments, the more the leverage will magnify any gains or losses on those investments.
                    •Inverse Funds involve certain risks, which include increased volatility due to the Funds' possible use of short sales of
                    securities and derivatives, such as options and futures. •The Funds' use of derivatives, such as futures, options and swap
                    agreements, may expose the Funds' shareholders to additional risks that they would not be subject to if they invested
                    directly in the securities underlying those derivatives. •Short-selling involves increased risks and costs. You risk
                    paying more for a security than you received from its sale. •Leveraged and inverse Funds seek to provide investment
                    results that match the performance of a specific benchmark, before fees and expenses, on a daily basis. Because the
                    Funds seek to track the performance of their benchmark on a daily basis, mathematical compounding, especially with
                    respect to those Funds that use leverage as part of their investment strategy, may prevent a fund from correlating
                    with the monthly, quarterly, annual or other period performance of its benchmark.Due to the compounding of daily returns,
                    leveraged and inverse Funds' returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from
                    the benchmark return for the same period. For those Funds that consistently apply leverage, the value of the fund's shares
                    will tend to increase or decrease more than the value of any increase or decrease in its benchmark index. The Funds rebalance their
                    portfolios on a daily basis, increasing exposure in response to that day's gains or reducing exposure in response to that day's
                    losses. Daily rebalancing will impair a fund's performance if the benchmark experiences volatility. Investors should
                    monitor their leveraged and inverse Funds' holdings consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily.
                    •For more on these and other risks, please read the prospectus.
                



                            An investment in the U.S. Government Money Market Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
                            or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share,
                            it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Liquid Alternative ETFs: WisdomTree DYLS and DYB






























































                            WisdomTree now has the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S.
                            Equity Fund (DYLS) and the WisdomTree Dynamic Bearish U.S. Equity Fund (DYB) enabling
                            investors to access the advantages of alternative investment strategies with all
                            the benefits of exchange-traded funds.
                            


WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Fund

DYLS is a primarily long1
                                    strategy that is designed to add short2 exposure to hedge risk and reduce
                                    the net long exposure. The Fund can be 100%, 50%, or 0% net long, depending on market
                                    conditions. 
                                


WisdomTree Dynamic Bearish U.S. Equity Fund


                                    DYB is able to be net short or market neutral when the market environment 
                                    is considered poor or mixed, and can have a small net long position when 
                                    the environment is deemed more attractive. The Fund can be 25% net long, 0% net long or 100% net short.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473), or visit wisdomtree.com to view or download a prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

        Regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist, in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out- or underperform market cap-weighted indexes. Over long periods, we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles, partly by tilting toward known return premiums. In 2015, value and size (i.e., small caps) underperformed, but momentum, quality and low volatility outperformed.1   
Now the question is what factors will perform best in 2016 and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market. WisdomTree recently created the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Index (WTDLS), designed to generate alpha at the core with a multi-factor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically. 
Key Features to WisdomTree Approach 
WisdomTree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade, typically focusing on signal factors such as value, quality and size; but now we are pleased to introduce this new multi-factor approach. The WisdomTree Dynamic Long U.S. Equity Index (WTDL) is the long component of WTDLS and comprises approximately 100 stocks with the highest combined fundamentals, which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly. 
•	Fundamental Selection: Stocks are graded on a combination of growth, quality and value factors, and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion. It is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system, because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another. By combining quality and value factors, which we believe complement each other, we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term, while still tapping into the long-term return premiums. 
 
•	Low-Volatility Weighting: In each sector, the Index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics, as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market. We know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor, so we believe applying it to a multi-factor selection model will also add value.  
 
•	Sector-Neutral Capping: The Index targets a sector-neutral allocation when compared to the largest 500 U.S. stocks by market capitalization. We believe this keeps the Index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or low-volatility weighting to significantly over- or under-weight certain sectors. We are confident about the stock selection and weighting process, so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a cap-weighted index.
To get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process, we compared WTDL against popular market cap-weighted style and factor indexes. 
 
Index Valuations

For definitions of terms and indexes in the chart, visit our glossary. 
 
•	Attractive across Multiple Valuation Measures: We find it impressive, but not surprising, that WTDL scored high on multiple valuation measures. As of 12/31/2015, WTDL had the highest dividend yield; it also showed similar price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios as the S&P 500 Value Index, both indicators highlighting its tilt toward value. WTDL had the second-highest quality metrics, defined by return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), a very close second only to the MSCI USA Quality Index, which focuses more directly on that factor. Lastly, WTDL had higher profit margins than the S&P 500 Index and very similar growth expectations. 
 
Dynamic Hedging Indicator
The above table highlights how WTDL had diversified exposure across multiple factors—but what if markets are choppy? For one thing, the low-volatility weighting methodology could help smooth the returns and lower market drawdowns, but a primary driver will be the dynamic hedging indicator.  
The dynamic hedging indicator uses growth and quality indicators such as profit margins and popular valuation measures to determine the hedge ratio or short percentage. So when the fundamentals, or profits, of the universe are deteriorating, the dynamic indicator would look to hedge the portfolio or increase the short percentage. Similarly, as valuations become more stretched, adding risk to the portfolio, the indicator would look to hedge as well. 
While our hedging indicator will certainly not get every market downdraft timed perfectly, it did start getting more bearishly positioned toward the end of 2015 and signaled to be 100% hedge for January 2016, making the net equity exposure for WTDLS 0% (or market neutral). We believe the factor diversity and dynamic equity exposure this index provides deserve a second look, given the recent market volatility and uncertainty for 2016.
