Talara Capital Management | Public Investment Strategies































 











 Public Investments






Talara manages real assets for institutional investors using a long-only equity strategy. We view real assets as a separate part of a diversified portfolio that protects against inflation and captures some of today’s most important global growth themes.




Major secular changes in the world are having a dramatic effect on real asset industries creating numerous investment opportunities. Many of our portfolio companies are benefiting from structural themes including the discovery of shale resources, advances in drilling and completion technology, the build out of energy infrastructure, the U.S. manufacturing renaissance, and emerging market urbanization.






Talara specializes in the three core segments within real assets: energy, materials and mining, and industrials and logistics. Focusing on these interconnected areas, our strategy strikes an optimal balance between a breadth of opportunity and our depth of knowledge.




Talara believes that the most intelligent way to invest in real assets is to concentrate our investments into a limited number of companies and to invest with a long-term horizon. To this end, our field research is aimed at identifying compounding businesses, asset transformations, and secular changes or inflection points in a business or industry.

Talara Capital Management | Our Company






























 












			Our Company		






The name Talara represents longevity. 
The Talara Basin is one of the oldest and longest producing hydrocarbon basins in the world. Production began in 1871, and continues to this day. It is located in the northwest coastal region of Peru and occupies the onshore coastal plain as well as the offshore continental shelf and slope. Prior to 1871, indigenous people in the area used the oil seeps to caulk boats.




Talara is more than just your typical investment firm, it is a collection of industry specialists with extensive experience in natural resources and industrials. Talara’s team, along with active and engaged Board Advisors, form the crux of what makes the firm special. With a vast network of cultivated industry relationships in both public and private markets, Talara has unique market intelligence and access to proprietary opportunities.






Talara Capital Management understands the importance of being close to the center of the North American energy industry and world financial center with offices located in both Houston and New York.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
