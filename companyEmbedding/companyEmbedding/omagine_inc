Omagine Project


Overview
In October 2014 the company's majority owned subsidiary, Omagine LLC, signed a Development Agreement with the Government of Oman for the development of a $2.5 Billion real-estate and tourism project known as the Omagine Project.

In March 2015 the Ministry of Finance in Oman ratified the Development Agreement.

In July 2015 the development rights to the 245 acres of beachfront land were registered with the Oman Government.

The Omagine Project is a mixed-use tourism and residential real estate project and is expected to take approximately five years from the start date to complete. Upon conclusion of an investment transaction with one of LLC’s present investment prospects, LLC will begin the master planning and development of the Omagine Project.

Omagine LLC, which is a 75% owned subsidiary of the company, was formed in Oman as a limited liability company in 2009 for the purpose of designing, developing, owning and operating the entire Omagine Project. The Omagine Site on which the Omagine Project will be developed consists of approximately 245 acres (equal to one million square meters) of prime beachfront land facing the Gulf of Oman just west of the capital city of Muscat and six (6) miles from Muscat International Airport.
The Omagine Project will be an integration of cultural, heritage, educational, entertainment and residential components, including: a high culture theme park containing seven pearl shaped buildings, each approximately 60 feet in diameter, associated exhibition buildings, a boardwalk, an open air amphitheater and stage; open space green areas; a canal and an enclosed harbor and marina area; associated retail shops and restaurants, entertainment venues, boat slips, and docking facilities; a five-star resort hotel, a four-star resort hotel and possibly a three or four-star hotel; commercial office buildings; shopping and retail establishments integrated with the hotels, and approximately two thousand residences to be developed for sale.
The company's internal financial model presently forecasts significant net positive cash flows for Omagine LLC over the seven year period subsequent to the signing of the Development Agreement and a net present value of the Omagine Project of approximately $1.55 billion dollars. The Company intends to continually update this model at regular intervals as new facts and information become vailable, as the development program and design process unfolds and as market conditions require.
This website contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance development and results of Omagine, Inc.'s business are detailed in the Company's reports filed with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (the "SEC Reports"). The Company urges investors to read the SEC Reports and cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.

About omagine


Omagine, Inc. is an entertainment, hospitality and tourism company with significant property management operations and residential and commercial real estate development activities.
The company is headquartered in New York City and has a subsidiary in Muscat, Oman. Depending upon unfolding events, the Company intends to open branch offices in Beirut, Lebanon and in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates during 2018.
We are a publicly traded Delaware, USA corporation. Our stock symbol is OMAG.

We select distinctive locations, mostly in the Middle East and North Africa (the “MENA Region”), which we design and develop into unique tourism destinations that have a “high culture” flavor and a “pop culture” texture. The MENA Region is one of the fastest growing tourism destinations in the world and governments there are diversifying their economies with tourism projects that create local employment.
The Company is focused on MENA Region entertainment, hospitality and real-estate development opportunities because we believe the enormous financial resources in the MENA Region combined with the governmental strategic vision presents superb development opportunities.
In addition to the Omagine Project in Oman, we have been holding serious discussions with Omani government officials regarding other projects in Oman and we have held initial discussions with government officials and business people in the MENA region about similar projects and other business opportunities therein. Company management, which has strong existing relationships with many businessmen and various Government officials in the region believes that opportunities will develop for the Company.
Oman is a wealthy, politically stable, forward & outward looking country in the southern Gulf region that has enormous economic and geographic assets. With its mountains, waterfalls, deserts, extensive coastlines and 6,000 year old cultural and maritime history, it provides unique tourism opportunities in the MENA Region.
Our destination properties are upscale, uplifting and uproariously entertaining.
Our projects always include traditionally designed residential and commercial components but the tourism components are thematically imbued with culturally aware and scientifically accurate entertainment experiences. All of our developments are historically faithful to their surroundings. The tourism elements tend to emphasize the great art, music, culture, science and philosophy of the world – the Great Ideas - while simultaneously being hip, stylish, trendy and very 21st century.
We have a family-oriented design and development bias which we employ to make our properties tell true and entertaining stories about their surroundings and the world. Our developments seamlessly integrate entertainment with art, culture, science and history.
Why do we do this?
Our aim is to generate exceptional value for our shareholders and to change the world into a more peaceful, prosperous, egalitarian and friendly place.

Manufacturing & Construction Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
The Manufacturing sector covers work performed in mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products. The assembling of component parts of manufactured products also falls under Manufacturing unless the activity is appropriately classified in Construction.
The Construction sector primarily covers work performed in the construction of buildings or engineering projects (e.g., highways and utility systems). 
	 Companies that perform work in the preparation of sites for new construction and those involved subdividing land for sale as building sites also are included in Construction.

Manufacturing uses raw materials that are products of agriculture, fishing, forestry, mining, or quarrying, as well as products of other manufacturing operations. Plants, factories, or mills that characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment, transform the raw materials into new finished products or components of products that require further manufacturing.

Construction markets include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. Activities of these enterprises generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction activities at multiple project sites. Production responsibilities are specified contractually with construction project owners (prime contractors) or contracts with other construction companies (subcontractors).

Construction companies that contract responsibility for all aspects of individual construction projects are commonly known as general contractors, but are also markets known as design-build, construction management, turnkey contracting, or (in cases where two or more establishments jointly secure a general contract) joint-venture contracting. Construction managers that provide oversight and scheduling only (i.e., agency) as well as construction managers that are responsible for the entire project (i.e., at risk) are included as
