         10-K: EXCALIBUR INDUSTRIES

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.  Excalibur, for approximately the past approximately 20 years, has adopted a policy designed to husband the Company's assets and retain as much of its mineral interests as possible taking into account the depressed market for uranium and Excalibur's limited resources. The Company recognized that it would have to rely on royalty income from its most promising properties and that it had little if any control over when uranium producers with which it had royalty agreements would commence mining. The records show that during the period of 1993 to May 31, 2013, with exception of 2006, the Company had zero royalty income. Form 10-K of the Company for 2006 indicates that the Company received advanced royalty from Uranerz Energy Corporation of $250,000. The lack of royalties was noted in Excalibur's 10-K Annual Report for 1998, wherein it is stated that "?advanced payments ended in May 1992 after which time no additional payments will be received until production commences. Other than interest income, no other continuing material cash inflows are known to management or anticipated at this time based on current agreements." The husbanding policy of the Company was and is a survival policy which may have worked. However, the consequences are:  1. The Company does not have the core of employees with the knowledge necessary to monitor and manage its properties and mineral interests and mining operations of uranium producers with whom it has royalty agreements.  2. The Company has not had audited financial statements since 1988 and cannot have a market for its shares without first attaining necessary financial audits for multiple years and compliance with all reporting standards of the Securities and Exchange Commission at considerable expense.  To solve some of the foregoing problems, the Company on February 27, 2012, engaged Meriden Engineering LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, situated in Hibbing, Minnesota ("Meriden"), to manage its administrative and leasehold affairs for both Excalibur and Mountain West. The agreement requires annual budget to be prepared by Meriden and submitted to the Company for approval. Compensation is earned by Meriden on an hourly basis for services performed at a rate of $175 per hour. While Meriden will issue monthly invoices for services rendered, payment is not due until royalty payments commence and are received. After commencement of royalty payments occurs, Meriden will prepare an annual budget for periods after the commencement of royalty payments and Meriden's compensation will be a management fee equal to 5% of the gross royalty revenue received by the Company. Extraordinary events or issues beyond the scope of the budget will be negotiated between Meriden and the Company as additional compensation. In addition, as an incentive, 5% of actual gross increase in the Company's consolidated revenues during each calendar year from all sources other than royalties shall be paid to Meriden. In the event the Company is sold, all deferred compensation will be paid in full, and in addition, a one-time termination fee in the amount of $250,000 will be paid to Meriden.  In December of 2012, Excalibur founder and long-time CEO, Joseph P. Hubert, CPG, and long-time Secretary/Treasurer, Marguerite Emanuel, retired, along with board member Bruce Sederberg. Jay R. Mackie was elected to the board and appointed President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Michael P. Johnson was elected to the board and appointed as Secretary and Treasurer. In May of 2013, Howard W. Hilshorst was added to the Board of Directors.  Two uranium producers, Uranerz Energy Corporation ("Uranerz") and Power Resources, Inc. ("Cameco"), have announced plans to begin producing uranium yellow cake in 2013 on properties located in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming on which Excalibur holds royalty interests. Uranerz is presently in the final stages of constructing a mining facility at the Nichols Ranch property and intends to commence ISL production in the fourth quarter of 2013. In March of 2013, Cameco informed Excalibur of their intention to begin production on its recently completed ISL facility at the North Butte.  In light of these recent developments, management has a reasonable expectation that there will be an income stream to the Company to provide liquidity. In the event the stream of revenue does not occur, the Company will, if necessary, attempt to secure loans or sell assets.

Excalibur Industries Company Profile

   Excalibur Industries is on a quest for uranium. Through subsidiary Mountain West Mines, the company holds interests in uranium properties, including some 85 patented claims, in Wyoming's Powder River Basin. Excalibur hopes to draw royalties from its mineral interests, but the company's contractual rights have been involved in a legal dispute. Excalibur has sold six of its Powder River Basin properties (accounting for about half of its claims) to Canadian mining company Uranerz Energy Corporation. Colorado silver claims held by Excalibur were sold in 2004.

Excalibur Industries Revenue and Financial Data

   Excalibur Industries is on a quest for uranium. Through subsidiary Mountain West Mines, the company holds interests in uranium properties, including some 85 patented claims, in Wyoming's Powder River Basin. Excalibur hopes to draw royalties from its mineral interests, but the company's contractual rights have been involved in a legal dispute. Excalibur has sold six of its Powder River Basin properties (accounting for about half of its claims) to Canadian mining company Uranerz Energy Corporation. Colorado silver claims held by Excalibur were sold in 2004.
