OverviewBavituximab OncologyCotara OncologyPGN650 Tumor ImagingBavituximab Antiviral 








					Pipeline			

 

 

 





 
Peregrine’s new class of phosphatidylserine (PS)-targeting antibodies target and bind to PS, a highly immunosuppressive molecule usually located inside the membrane of healthy cells, but "flips" and becomes exposed on the outside of tumor cells and cells that line tumor blood vessels, causing the tumor to evade immune detection. Bavituximab is our lead therapeutic PS-targeting antibody candidate, which has demonstrated broad potential and represents a new approach to treating cancer. In preclinical studies, PS-targeting antibodies have demonstrated multiple signs of immune activation.
We are advancing the clinical development of bavituximab through company-sponsored trials as well as via strategic collaborations with recognized leaders in the oncology treatment field.

About Peregrine
Peregrine Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutics to stimulate the body's immune system to fight cancer.  We are pursuing multiple clinical programs with our lead product candidate, bavituximab. Peregrine also has in-house cGMP manufacturing capabilities through its wholly-owned subsidiary Avid Bioservices, Inc. (www.avidbio.com), which provides development and biomanufacturing services for both Peregrine and outside customers.
Bavituximab, in combination with other anti-cancer agents, has demonstrated promising signs of anti-tumor activity.  Bavituximab is an investigational immunotherapy designed to assist the body's immune system by targeting and modulating the activity of phosphatidylserine (PS), a highly immune-suppressive signaling molecule expressed broadly on the surface of tumor cells and tumor blood vessel cells. PS targeting antibodies are thought to affect the immunosuppressive environment that many tumors establish in order to proliferate and spread, while also fighting cancer by activating immune cells that target and fight cancer.  Peregrine is working with recognized oncology leaders, including AstraZeneca (AZ), Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center to advance its research and clinical programs, and to capture the value that we believe exists in new bavituximab therapeutic combinations and indications.  For more information about bavituximab, click here. For more information on antibody mediated blockade of the phosphatidylserine (PS) signaling pathway, click here.
In addition to drug development, Peregrine’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Avid Bioservices, is a growing commercial biomanufacturing business that provides a comprehensive range of process development, high quality cGMP clinical and commercial manufacturing services for Peregrine and other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies. With over 15 years of experience producing monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins in batch, fed-batch and perfusion modes, Avid's services include cGMP clinical and commercial product manufacturing utilizing stainless steel and single use technology, purification, bulk packaging, stability testing and regulatory strategy, submission and support. The company also provides a variety of process development activities, including cell line development and optimization, cell culture and feed optimization, analytical methods development and product characterization. For more information about Avid, please visit www.avidbio.com.

History[edit]
Peregrine was founded in 1981.[1]
In 2002 Peregrine established a wholly owned subsidiary, Avid Bioservices, a contract manufacturing organization that provides cGMP development and biomanufacturing services for both Peregrine and outside customers.[2] In 2015 Avid had revenues of about $27 million, about 80% of which came under contract from Halozyme Therapeutics.[1]
Products in development[edit]
Bavituximab[edit]
Bavituximab (PGN401) is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody against phosphatidylserine, which is a component of cell membranes that is exposed when a cell is transformed into solid tumor cancer cell or dies,[3][4] and when cells are infected with hepatitis C.[5] The process of cell death is highly controlled and so there usually no immune response to phosphatidylserine but when bavituximab binds to it, the conjugate appears to stimulate an immune response in humans.[4]
124I-PGN650[edit]




Example image from preclinical studies


124I-PGN650 is a phosphatidylserine-targeting F(ab')2 fully human monoclonal antibody fragment joined to the PET imaging radio-isotope iodine-124 being developed to obtain medical images of cancer.[6]
Cotara[edit]
Cotara (131I-chTNT-1/B) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against DNA-histone H1 complex called TNT-1, conjugated to the radioisotope iodine-131.[7][8] As of 2016 Peregrine was developing it for Glioblastoma multiforme; it has been granted orphan status in Europe and the US.[8]

History[edit]
Peregrine was founded in 1981.[1]
In 2002 Peregrine established a wholly owned subsidiary, Avid Bioservices, a contract manufacturing organization that provides cGMP development and biomanufacturing services for both Peregrine and outside customers.[2] In 2015 Avid had revenues of about $27 million, about 80% of which came under contract from Halozyme Therapeutics.[1]
Products in development[edit]
Bavituximab[edit]
Bavituximab (PGN401) is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody against phosphatidylserine, which is a component of cell membranes that is exposed when a cell is transformed into solid tumor cancer cell or dies,[3][4] and when cells are infected with hepatitis C.[5] The process of cell death is highly controlled and so there usually no immune response to phosphatidylserine but when bavituximab binds to it, the conjugate appears to stimulate an immune response in humans.[4]
124I-PGN650[edit]




Example image from preclinical studies


124I-PGN650 is a phosphatidylserine-targeting F(ab')2 fully human monoclonal antibody fragment joined to the PET imaging radio-isotope iodine-124 being developed to obtain medical images of cancer.[6]
Cotara[edit]
Cotara (131I-chTNT-1/B) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against DNA-histone H1 complex called TNT-1, conjugated to the radioisotope iodine-131.[7][8] As of 2016 Peregrine was developing it for Glioblastoma multiforme; it has been granted orphan status in Europe and the US.[8]

Peregrine Pharmaceuticals Provides Update on Phase III SUNRISE Trial of Bavituximab
Conference Call With Management Scheduled for 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time

TUSTIN, Calif., Feb.  25, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PPHM) (NASDAQ:PPHMP), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutics to stimulate the body's immune system to fight cancer, today announced that it is discontinuing the company's Phase III SUNRISE trial of bavituximab in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The decision to stop the trial was based on the recommendation of the study's Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) following a pre-specified interim analysis performed after 33% of targeted overall events (patient deaths) in the study were reached. Results of the analysis demonstrated that the bavituximab plus 
docetaxel group did not show a sufficient improvement in overall survival as compared to the docetaxel group to warrant continuation of the study. The interim analysis showed that the bavituximab combination group is performing as expected according to the original trial assumptions in terms of overall survival, while the docetaxel group is dramatically outperforming overall survival expectations based on the original trial assumptions and as compared to recently published studies.
"Let me start by taking this opportunity to thank all of the patients, their families, and the physicians who participated in the SUNRISE trial. While we are deeply disappointed by this early outcome from the SUNRISE trial, we plan to take a deliberate and detailed approach in reviewing and verifying all available data from the trial in order to understand what subgroups or other patient characteristics may have impacted the performance of the study. While we perform this analysis, we plan to put our other chemotherapy combination studies on hold until we have a clear understanding of the SUNRISE study results," said Steven W. King, president and chief executive officer of Peregrine. "While this is an unexpected and disappointing setback for the bavituximab chemotherapy combination clinical program, we have not seen anything in this trial 
result that diminishes our enthusiasm for advancing our immuno-oncology (I-O) combination trials. The I-O combination studies are based on different mechanistic synergies that are clearly separate from the chemotherapy combination being evaluated in the SUNRISE study. In addition, it is important to note that in no way do these results have any impact on our contract manufacturing business conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary, Avid Bioservices. This business has shown consistent revenue growth and has been instrumental in maintaining a strong cash position and our plan is to continue growing this business." As of February 1, 2016, Avid Bioservices had a revenue backlog in excess of $58 million under committed contracts from existing clients. In addition, Peregrine had $67.5 million in cash and equivalents as of 
January 31, 2016. Conference Call Today Peregrine will host a conference call today beginning at 4:30 PM Eastern Time (1:30 PM Pacific Time). To listen to the conference call, please dial (877) 312-5443 or (253) 237-1126 and request the Peregrine Pharmaceuticals conference call. To listen to the archived webcast please visit: 
http://ir.peregrineinc.com/events.cfm. About Bavituximab: A Targeted Investigational Immunotherapy Bavituximab is an investigational chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets phosphatidylserine (PS). Signals from PS inhibit the ability of immune cells to recognize and fight tumors. Bavituximab is believed to override PS mediated immunosuppressive signaling by blocking the engagement of PS with its receptors as well as by sending an alternate immune activating signal. PS targeting antibodies have been shown to shift the functions of immune cells in tumors, resulting in multiple signs of immune activation and robust anti-tumor immune responses.  About Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutics to stimulate the body's immune system to fight cancer. Bavituximab is the company's lead immunotherapy candidate. In addition to its drug development programs, Peregrine also has in-house cGMP manufacturing capabilities through its wholly-owned subsidiary Avid Bioservices, Inc. (www.avidbio.com), which provides development and biomanufacturing services for both Peregrine and third-party customers. For more information, please visit www.peregrineinc.com.

The forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including, 
but not limited to, the risk that the company's collaborator in connection with its immuno-oncology combination trial may terminate the collaboration, the risk that the results from the company's immune-oncology trial may not support further advancement of bavituximab, the risk that results from future immune-oncology trials may not support  the submission of a Biologics License Application, the risk that the company may not have or raise adequate financial resources from debt and/or equity financings and/or Avid's manufacturing operations to fund the further development of bavituximab, the risk that Avid's revenue growth may slow or decline, the risk that Avid may experience technical difficulties in processing customer orders which could delay delivery of products to customers and receipt of payment, and the risk that one or more existing Avid customers terminates its contract prior to 
completion. The company's actual results could differ materially from those in any such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, uncertainties associated with completing preclinical and clinical trials for our technologies; the early stage of product development; the significant costs to develop our products as all of our products are currently in development, preclinical studies or clinical trials; obtaining additional financing to support our operations and the development of our products; obtaining regulatory approval for our technologies; anticipated timing of regulatory filings and the potential success in gaining regulatory approval and complying with governmental regulations applicable to our business. Our business could be affected by a number of other factors, including the risk factors listed from 
time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 as well as any updates to these risk factors filed from time to time in the company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

Dr. Shallenberger has been on the forefront of integrative medicine for several years with his involvement with the American College for the Advancement of Medicine (ACAM), The American Preventive Medical Association, and the American Academy
