Three businesses announced in DL's McKinley Plaza project

By Nathan Bowe
 on Jun 29, 2016  at 5:15 p.m.





BY NATHAN BOWEnbowe@dlnewspapers.comMcKinley Plaza LLP, a four-story mixed-use building in downtown Detroit Lakes, is nearing completion.

 
Mixed-use means the complex will house several businesses on the ground floor and 36 residential apartments on the top three floors.Commercial tenants that have signed leases so far include Dairy Queen, which will relocate from the Washington Square Mall to the north end of McKinley Plaza, where its new store will have a drive-through.“There’ll be plenty of stacking space for cars to line up,” said Jim Buus, one of the developers.Other commercial ventures that have signed leases are The UPS Store and APEX Engineering.Negotiations continue with several other prospective tenants, Buus said.“Generally speaking the project is on time and on budget,” Buus said. “It’s tracking nicely as far as apartments and commercial space getting leased up.”There is room for at least three more and possibly as many as six commercial tenants, depending on their space needs, he said.“On the south side of the building is a one-story bump-out that is designed for a restaurant,” Buus added. “We’ve been talking to a variety of restaurants for the past year, national and local, and we’re still working on getting a lease signed.”The site offers 23,000 square feet of commercial space.Construction on the nearly-$10 million project started in September and has progressed smoothly,Currently half of the apartments are leased and about half of the commercial space is leased, but “lots of great apartments and commercial space remain,” Buus said. “The siding is going up, the parking lot is going in now – it’s on time, on schedule, we’re really excited to fill in this last gap in downtown after the Highway 10 realignment.”The site offers underground parking and other amenities.It’s a concept the developers have already tried and have had success with in West Fargo.“The four-story McKinley Plaza will be flagship presence that will tie the larger downtown area together and is consistent with our interest in redeveloping existing sites in the middle of town as opposed to sprawling, suburban-style development,” another developer, Brent Kuehne, said earlier.Buus and Kuehne, who are affiliated with Goldmark Schlossman Commercial Real Estate Services, have five other partners in the development.

The main contractor is Gehrtz Construction Services and design work was done by Zerr-Berg Architects.“We’re shooting for approximately Sept. 1 for completion,” Buus said.
