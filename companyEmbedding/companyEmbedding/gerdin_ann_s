Russell A. & Ann S. Gerdin
 non-UI grad
Friend 2006

Russell and Ann Gerdin have left an indelible mark on the University of Iowa for their commitment to the institution and, in particular, its student athletes.
As founder, president, and chief executive officer of one of Iowas most successful businesses, the Coralville-based trucking company Heartland Express—named one of Americas 200 best small companies by Forbes magazine in ten of the last 13 years—Russ Gerdin has generously shared his own achievement to help ensure the future success of UI students. A former teacher, Ann Gerdin continues to make a difference in the lives of students and others through her philanthropic and community service efforts.
Those familiar with the UIs efforts to ensure that its students-athletes have access to the best possible education are well aware of the Gerdins primary legacy to date on the UI campus: the Russell and Ann Gerdin Athletic Learning Center, which the couple made possible with a leadership gift of $4 million.
To ensure that the universitys commitment to preparing young people for meaningful careers remains front and center, the privately financed, state-of-the-art Gerdin Center—opened in 2003 with a library, tutorial spaces, computer laboratory, and more—enables the UI Athletic Student Services office to fully integrate the athletic and academic development of more than 600 Hawkeye studentathletes each year.
The Gerdins have long combined their commitment to education with their love for the Iowa Hawkeyes. In addition to their extraordinary gift for the learning center, the couple made a $1 million commitment to support the UI Athletics Hall of Fame and have given annually to the UI athletics scholarship fund for more than 20 years.
Director of UI Athletics Bob Bowlsby notes, The quality of our athletics program relies upon first-rate student-athletes who are as strong academically as they are athletically. Russell and Anns gift for the learning center has enabled us to focus even more on the athletic development of our young people and offer potential recruits the best of what the university has to offer. The Gerdins gifts for the learning center and the Hall of Fame are far-reaching, as they touch each and every student athlete who enrolls at the University of Iowa.
The Gerdins' other philanthropic interests are a testament to their belief in the power of education to transform society for the better. Recipients of their generosity include Iowa State University, where the Gerdin Business Building houses the business college; Russs alma mater, Minnesota State University; and various local community initiatives. They have also provided more than $2 million toward the educational pursuits of Heartland employees and their children.
With the Russell and Ann Gerdin Athletic Learning Center, the Gerdin name will be forever connected to academic and athletic excellence at the University of Iowa. Even more important, however, is that the Gerdins hearts are with the UI as it pursues its vital mission of educating the young people who will become future leaders in Iowa and beyond.
True Hawkeyes—and true friends of the university—the Gerdins are clearly deserving of this Distinguished Alumni Award.
Russ and Ann Gerdin are members of the UI Presidents Club.

Russell Gerdin


1941 - 2011
Obituary
Condolences

































 Russell A. GerdinNorth LibertyRussell Allen Gerdin, 70, passed peacefully with family at his side on October 14, 2011 at his home in North Liberty, IA after years of battling health issues. Russ was born on September 4, 1941 son of Wilford and Adah (Pike) Gerdin in Princeton, MN. He attended elementary and high school in Princeton and entered the U.S. Coast Guard upon graduating. He later attended Moorhead State University in Moorhead, MN and graduated with a business degree in 1965. On July 29, 1967 Russ and Ann (Mikkelsen) were married. Soon after, Russ and Wilford bought a truck line in Holdrege, NE. A short time later they sold that company and Russ bought Revell Transportation in Shenandoah, IA. Russ re-named that company Heartland Express. After several years Russ sold that company and bought Scott Transportation in Swisher, IA in 1978. He also named that company Heartland Express and it became the company we know today.Russ was a major contributor to the University of Iowa and Iowa State Universities. However, his most rewarding contribution has been an ongoing Educational Trust Fund that was set up to educate the children of Heartland Express. To date, over 300 children have been a part of this program. Russ and Ann also contributed to the Russell and Ann Gerdin American Cancer Society Hope Lodge in Iowa City, the Gerdin Business Building at Iowa State University, the Gerdin Athletic Learning Center at the University of Iowa and the Gerdin Wellness Center at Moorhead State University. Russ is survived by his wife, Ann, their three children and their spouses, Michael and Nicole (Fountas) Gerdin, Eric and Julie (Gerdin) Durr and Brian and Angela (Gerdin) Janssen and ten grandchildren. He is also survived by his sister and brother-in-law, Thomas and Kay (Gerdin) Hudson of Wolfeboro, NH and many nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents.  May the winds of love blow softly And whisper so you'll hear, We will always love and miss you And wish that you were here.
