Begin with Gratitude : A Richmond Brothers Core Value









































Begin with Gratitude






Begin with Gratitude

"As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them."
- John F. Kennedy

 
The state of being thankful can have a positive impact on so many areas of our lives. It makes us more productive. More driven. It makes us strive harder and achieve more. It makes us better human beings.
At Richmond Brothers, we are grateful for the gifts and talents we’ve been given and for being in the position to make a difference in the lives of others. We appreciate all the wonderful people in our lives—our families, friends, and clients—and the joy and inspiration they provide us. This enduring sense of gratitude gives us the strength and motivation to bring our best selves to the job, every day.

Richmond Brothers will comply as we do provide services for these types of assets.

Client Advisory Board


Richmond Brothers’ Client Advisory Board was established in 2011 to provide Richmond Brothers with input on various initiatives.
Client input plays a very important role at Richmond Brothers and helps drive the integral part of our business. The board is represented by an active group of eight clients who provide feedback and suggestions to Richmond Brothers on the services the company provides. In addition, they play an important role in the decision-making processes that affect the entire client base.
Richmond Brothers has always prided itself on listening and understanding our clients so that we, in turn, can provide the best service possible for each one of our clients. Input from past boards has helped with various things such as helping Richmond Brothers’ become a Registered Investment Adviser, the processes in which our advisors and staff members serve our clients, a new logo and slogan for the company, changes to publications and other correspondence sent to clients, events for clients, and even this web site.

Non-Profit Causes Supported by the Richmond Brothers









































Causes






Building a Strong Foundation in Our Community
True to our core values of service and generosity, we’re proud to lend our time, talents, and financial aid to a number of local, national, and international causes.
We focus on the health, well-being, and education of children, who are our greatest hope for a bright and positive future. We assist by providing basic needs, education, and opportunity where none exist—or by funding and developing existing programs so that they may carry on their legacy.
The Local and International Causes We Proudly Support
Jackson College
Richmond Brothers has established an endeavor with Jackson College to help fund the Wilbur L. Dungy Endowed Chair. Endowed chairs provide long-term financial stability to the College and enable a more diverse curriculum that is not dependent on typical income sources such as tuition. We’ve also funded a scholarship program at the College, because we believe all young adults deserve the life opportunities that a good education affords.
Learn more about the Jackson College Scholarship program
Jackson YMCA

Richmond Brothers is honored to help support the Jackson YMCA through the Strong Kids, Strong Communities Campaign. The YMCA mission is to put Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy Spirit, Mind, and Body for all. In addition, Matthew Curfman serves as the President of the YMCA Board of Directors. To learn more about the Jackson YMCA and how you can help, please visit their website.   
The Lingap Children’s Foundation
Richmond Brothers supports The Lingap Children’s Foundation, a nonprofit organization providing healthcare, counseling, and educational opportunities for Filipino children who have suffered from child abuse, abandonment, neglect, and exploitation. It’s an honor to be associated with such a wonderful group of people who are driving real and positive change within challenged communities. Our contributions to The Lingap Children’s Foundation have included both funding and volunteering.
The Lingap Children’s Foundation and the Lingap Center has successfully assisted all of the children in attending school, including 15 in college and three who have graduated from college. Since 2008, the Center has also operated a Street Children’s Education Program that teaches reading, basic arithmetic and hygiene and provides a free meal and access to Friday catechism lessons in church to approximately 150 street children each day.
Dave Richmond has traveled to the Philippines on behalf of LCF over 21 times in eight years, and his dedication to the organization has resulted in the honor of being announced as one of 3 finalists in the Global Community Impact Award category of the eighth annual Invest in Others Community Leadership Awards.
Jackson Enterprise Group
In 2016, Richmond Brothers joined the Imagine Jackson 2020 Initiative through the Jackson Enterprise Group (EG) to help stimulate economic prosperity in Jackson County. EG has been the County’s primary economic development organization since 1997. It has recently reorganized and reinvigorated its efforts through new professional staff and a renewed commitment from its volunteer leaders and investors. With the Imagine Jackson program, EG leaders and other stakeholders have been working to develop the next five-year plan - Imagine Jackson 2020. Tara Furnas serves as a board member for this wonderful initiative. 
American Cancer Society
Like so many people today, the Richmond Brothers family continues to be impacted by cancer. To help bring hope and healing to cancer patients, survivors, and families, Richmond Brothers supports the American Cancer Society through the Tony Open and Relay for Life. We have also provided funding to WACKY (Warriors Against Cancer in Kids and Young Adults), a group dedicated to eradicating childhood cancer and empowering young adult cancer fighters.
