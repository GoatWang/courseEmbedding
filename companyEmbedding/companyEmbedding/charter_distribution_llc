What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web.

LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.

The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
