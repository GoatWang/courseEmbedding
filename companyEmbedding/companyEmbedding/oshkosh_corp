                                            Oshkosh Corporation designs and builds the world's toughest vehicles by working shoulder-to-shoulder with the people who use them.
                                            We make it our business to understand the rigors of our customers' jobs, and deliver vehicles to them that out-perform anything else 
                                                on the market.  We then back those vehicles with a 24/7 global service network. And because our company is broadly diversified, we can 
                                                leverage our proprietary technologies to create powerful competitive advantages across many different markets.
This philosophy has earned Oshkosh a leadership position in every truck market in which we compete, including defense, fire and emergency, concrete placement and refuse hauling.

History[edit]
Founded in 1917 as the Wisconsin Duplex Auto Company, the company was created to build a severe-duty four-wheel-drive truck. After the first prototype was built, the company began to develop rapidly. This first four-wheel-drive truck, known today as "Old Betsy", is still owned by Oshkosh Corporation and housed in one of its assembly plants in Oshkosh. The vehicle still runs and is used frequently in demonstrations and parades.[4][5] The first mass-produced truck was the 2-ton Model A, with seven produced in 1918. The 3.5-ton Model B and 5-ton Model F followed. The Model TR, introduced in 1933, was a diversification for the company and was the first rubber tired earthmover ever built.[6]
The Model 50-50, introduced in 1955, was the first truck created specifically for the hauling of concrete. The first ARFF built by Oshkosh was a W Series truck delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1953. Oshkosh has also produced aircraft tow tractors, and in 1968 the company designed and built the U-30, 45 of which were built for the U.S. Air Force to tow the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft.[6]
In 1976 the company won a U.S. Army contract to supply 744 M911 heavy equipment transporters,[6] the first in a long line of U.S. Army contracts that now sees Oshkosh Defense as the sole supplier of medium and heavy tactical trucks to the U.S. Army and Marines.[7]
On August 25, 2015, Oshkosh was awarded the U.S. military's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle contract. The initial JLTV award is valued at $6.75 billion for up to 16,901 vehicles. The procurement objective for JLTV stands at 54,599 vehicles (49,099 Army; 5500 Marines), the estimated program cost being $47.6 billion.[8][9][10] JLTV will partially replace the AM General Humvee.
Locations[edit]

History[edit]
Founded in 1917 as the Wisconsin Duplex Auto Company, the company was created to build a severe-duty four-wheel-drive truck. After the first prototype was built, the company began to develop rapidly. This first four-wheel-drive truck, known today as "Old Betsy", is still owned by Oshkosh Corporation and housed in one of its assembly plants in Oshkosh. The vehicle still runs and is used frequently in demonstrations and parades.[4][5] The first mass-produced truck was the 2-ton Model A, with seven produced in 1918. The 3.5-ton Model B and 5-ton Model F followed. The Model TR, introduced in 1933, was a diversification for the company and was the first rubber tired earthmover ever built.[6]
The Model 50-50, introduced in 1955, was the first truck created specifically for the hauling of concrete. The first ARFF built by Oshkosh was a W Series truck delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1953. Oshkosh has also produced aircraft tow tractors, and in 1968 the company designed and built the U-30, 45 of which were built for the U.S. Air Force to tow the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft.[6]
In 1976 the company won a U.S. Army contract to supply 744 M911 heavy equipment transporters,[6] the first in a long line of U.S. Army contracts that now sees Oshkosh Defense as the sole supplier of medium and heavy tactical trucks to the U.S. Army and Marines.[7]
On August 25, 2015, Oshkosh was awarded the U.S. military's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle contract. The initial JLTV award is valued at $6.75 billion for up to 16,901 vehicles. The procurement objective for JLTV stands at 54,599 vehicles (49,099 Army; 5500 Marines), the estimated program cost being $47.6 billion.[8][9][10] JLTV will partially replace the AM General Humvee.

History[edit]
Founded in 1917 as the Wisconsin Duplex Auto Company, the company was created to build a severe-duty four-wheel-drive truck. After the first prototype was built, the company began to develop rapidly. This first four-wheel-drive truck, known today as "Old Betsy", is still owned by Oshkosh Corporation and housed in one of its assembly plants in Oshkosh. The vehicle still runs and is used frequently in demonstrations and parades.[4][5] The first mass-produced truck was the 2-ton Model A, with seven produced in 1918. The 3.5-ton Model B and 5-ton Model F followed. The Model TR, introduced in 1933, was a diversification for the company and was the first rubber tired earthmover ever built.[6]
The Model 50-50, introduced in 1955, was the first truck created specifically for the hauling of concrete. The first ARFF built by Oshkosh was a W Series truck delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1953. Oshkosh has also produced aircraft tow tractors, and in 1968 the company designed and built the U-30, 45 of which were built for the U.S. Air Force to tow the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft.[6]
In 1976 the company won a U.S. Army contract to supply 744 M911 heavy equipment transporters,[6] the first in a long line of U.S. Army contracts that now sees Oshkosh Defense as the sole supplier of medium and heavy tactical trucks to the U.S. Army and Marines.[7]
On August 25, 2015, Oshkosh was awarded the U.S. military's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle contract. The initial JLTV award is valued at $6.75 billion for up to 16,901 vehicles. The procurement objective for JLTV stands at 54,599 vehicles (49,099 Army; 5500 Marines), the estimated program cost being $47.6 billion.[8][9][10] JLTV will partially replace the AM General Humvee.
Locations[edit]
Oshkosh Corporation is headquartered in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. It has manufacturing operations in eight U.S. states and in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France and Romania and through investments in joint ventures in Mexico and Brazil. The Access Equipment division is headquartered in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania; the Defense division in Oshkosh, Wisconsin; the Fire & Emergency division in Appleton, Wisconsin; and the Commercial division in Dodge Center, Minnesota.
Oshkosh products and services are sold in more than 130 countries around the globe. The company also maintains a global service network.
Subsidiaries[edit]

History[edit]
Founded in 1917 as the Wisconsin Duplex Auto Company, the company was created to build a severe-duty four-wheel-drive truck. After the first prototype was built, the company began to develop rapidly. This first four-wheel-drive truck, known today as "Old Betsy", is still owned by Oshkosh Corporation and housed in one of its assembly plants in Oshkosh. The vehicle still runs and is used frequently in demonstrations and parades.[4][5] The first mass-produced truck was the 2-ton Model A, with seven produced in 1918. The 3.5-ton Model B and 5-ton Model F followed. The Model TR, introduced in 1933, was a diversification for the company and was the first rubber tired earthmover ever built.[6]
The Model 50-50, introduced in 1955, was the first truck created specifically for the hauling of concrete. The first ARFF built by Oshkosh was a W Series truck delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1953. Oshkosh has also produced aircraft tow tractors, and in 1968 the company designed and built the U-30, 45 of which were built for the U.S. Air Force to tow the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft.[6]
In 1976 the company won a U.S. Army contract to supply 744 M911 heavy equipment transporters,[6] the first in a long line of U.S. Army contracts that now sees Oshkosh Defense as the sole supplier of medium and heavy tactical trucks to the U.S. Army and Marines.[7]
On August 25, 2015, Oshkosh was awarded the U.S. military's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle contract. The initial JLTV award is valued at $6.75 billion for up to 16,901 vehicles. The procurement objective for JLTV stands at 54,599 vehicles (49,099 Army; 5500 Marines), the estimated program cost being $47.6 billion.[8][9][10] JLTV will partially replace the AM General Humvee.
Locations[edit]
Oshkosh Corporation is headquartered in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. It has manufacturing operations in eight U.S. states and in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France and Romania and through investments in joint ventures in Mexico and Brazil. The Access Equipment division is headquartered in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania; the Defense division in Oshkosh, Wisconsin; the Fire & Emergency division in Appleton, Wisconsin; and the Commercial division in Dodge Center, Minnesota.
Oshkosh products and services are sold in more than 130 countries around the globe. The company also maintains a global service network.
Subsidiaries[edit]

History[edit]
Founded in 1917 as the Wisconsin Duplex Auto Company, the company was created to build a severe-duty four-wheel-drive truck. After the first prototype was built, the company began to develop rapidly. This first four-wheel-drive truck, known today as "Old Betsy", is still owned by Oshkosh Corporation and housed in one of its assembly plants in Oshkosh. The vehicle still runs and is used frequently in demonstrations and parades.[4][5] The first mass-produced truck was the 2-ton Model A, with seven produced in 1918. The 3.5-ton Model B and 5-ton Model F followed. The Model TR, introduced in 1933, was a diversification for the company and was the first rubber tired earthmover ever built.[6]
The Model 50-50, introduced in 1955, was the first truck created specifically for the hauling of concrete. The first ARFF built by Oshkosh was a W Series truck delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1953. Oshkosh has also produced aircraft tow tractors, and in 1968 the company designed and built the U-30, 45 of which were built for the U.S. Air Force to tow the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft.[6]
In 1976 the company won a U.S. Army contract to supply 744 M911 heavy equipment transporters,[6] the first in a long line of U.S. Army contracts that now sees Oshkosh Defense as the sole supplier of medium and heavy tactical trucks to the U.S. Army and Marines.[7]
On August 25, 2015, Oshkosh was awarded the U.S. military's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle contract. The initial JLTV award is valued at $6.75 billion for up to 16,901 vehicles. The procurement objective for JLTV stands at 54,599 vehicles (49,099 Army; 5500 Marines), the estimated program cost being $47.6 billion.[8][9][10] JLTV will partially replace the AM General Humvee.
Locations[edit]
Oshkosh Corporation is headquartered in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. It has manufacturing operations in eight U.S. states and in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France and Romania and through investments in joint ventures in Mexico and Brazil. The Access Equipment division is headquartered in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania; the Defense division in Oshkosh, Wisconsin; the Fire & Emergency division in Appleton, Wisconsin; and the Commercial division in Dodge Center, Minnesota.
Oshkosh products and services are sold in more than 130 countries around the globe. The company also maintains a global service network.
Subsidiaries[edit]
Oshkosh Corp. manufactures, distributes and services products under the brands of Oshkosh, JLG, Pierce, McNeilus, Jerr-Dan, Oshkosh Specialty Vehicles, Frontline Communications, CON-E-CO, London Machinery Inc., and IMT.

The vehicle still runs and is used frequently in demonstrations and parades.[4][5] The first mass-produced truck was the 2-ton Model A, with seven produced in 1918. The 3.5-ton Model B and 5-ton Model F followed. The Model TR, introduced in 1933, was a diversification for the company and was the first rubber tired earthmover ever built.[6]
The Model 50-50, introduced in 1955, was the first truck created specifically for the hauling of concrete. The first ARFF built by Oshkosh was a W Series truck delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1953. Oshkosh has also produced aircraft tow tractors, and in 1968 the company designed and built the U-30, 45 of which were built for the U.S. Air Force to tow the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft.[6]
In 1976 the company won a U.S. Army contract to supply 744 M911 heavy equipment transporters,[6] the first in a long line of U.S. Army contracts that now sees Oshkosh Defense as the sole supplier of medium and heavy tactical trucks to the U.S. Army and Marines.[7]
On August 25, 2015, Oshkosh was awarded the U.S. military's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle contract. The initial JLTV award is valued at $6.75 billion for up to 16,901 vehicles. The procurement objective for JLTV stands at 54,599 vehicles (49,099 Army; 5500 Marines), the estimated program cost being $47.6 billion.[8][9][10] JLTV will partially replace the AM General Humvee.
