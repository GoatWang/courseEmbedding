State Street Bank and Trust Company Agrees to Pay $382.4 Million in a Global Settlement for Misleading Mutual Funds and Other Custody Clients
Jul 27 16
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that State Street Bank and Trust Company has agreed to pay $382.4 million in a global settlement for misleading mutual funds and other custody clients by applying hidden markups to foreign currency exchange trades. As part of its custody bank line of business, State Street safeguards clients' financial assets and offers such services as indirect foreign currency exchange trading (Indirect FX) for clients to buy and sell foreign currencies as needed to settle their transactions involving foreign securities. An SEC investigation found that State Street realized substantial revenues by misleading custody clients about Indirect FX, telling some clients that it guaranteed the most competitive rates available on their foreign currency exchange trades, provided "best execution," or charged "market rates" on the transactions. State Street instead set prices largely driven by predetermined, uniform markups and made no effort to obtain the best possible prices for these clients. State Street has agreed to pay $167.4 million in disgorgement and penalties to the SEC, a $155 million penalty to the Department of Justice, and at least $60 million to ERISA plan clients in an agreement with the Department of Labor. Under the terms of the agreement, the SEC will issue its order instituting the settled administrative proceeding only after a federal court approves State Street's proposed settlement with private plaintiffs in pending securities class action lawsuits concerning its pricing of foreign currency exchange trades. State Street has agreed to admit certain findings in the SEC's order. The SEC's order will find that State Street willfully violated Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and caused violations of Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 31a-1(b) by providing its registered investment company custody clients with trade confirmations and monthly transaction reports that were materially misleading in light of the representations it made about how it priced foreign currency exchange transactions. State Street will be required to pay $75 million in disgorgement plus $17.4 million in interest to harmed clients as well as a $75 million penalty.

Securities and Exchange Commission Announces State Street Bank and Trust Company Agree to Pay $12 Million to Settle Charges for Pay-to-Play Scheme
Jan 14 16
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that State Street Bank and Trust Company agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges that it conducted a pay-to-play scheme through its then-senior vice president and a hired lobbyist to win contracts to service Ohio pension funds. An SEC investigation found that Vincent DeBaggis, who headed State Street's public funds group responsible for serving as custodians or sub-custodians to public retirement funds, entered into an agreement with Ohio's then-deputy treasurer to make illicit cash payments and political campaign contributions. In exchange, State Street received three lucrative sub-custodian contracts to safeguard certain funds' investment assets and effect the settlement of their securities transactions. DeBaggis agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying $174,202.81 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $100,000 penalty. The SEC further alleges that Robert Crowe, a law firm partner who worked as a fundraiser and lobbyist for State Street, participated in the scheme and entered into undisclosed arrangements with the then-deputy treasurer to make secret illegal campaign contributions to obtain and retain business awarded to State Street. The SEC filed a complaint against Crowe in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.

State Street Bank and Trust Company

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

State Street Bank and Trust Company simply State Street is a custodian bank organized as a Massachusetts trust company specializing in services to mutual funds and their advisers, collective investment funds, corporate and public pension funds, insurance companies, operating companies and non-profit organizations. It is a subsidiary of the State Street Corporation, and used to also provide retail banking and commercial lending products until it sold off that division in 1999 to Citizens Financial Group, of Providence, Rhode Island. The retail banking and commercial lending units were sold for $350 million.
State Street, and its sister company State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), which is a leading registered investment advisor, together comprise the principal operating companies within parent company State Street Corporation.
History[edit]
State Street provides core investment custody, hedge fund or investment/securities accounting, fund administration, securities finance and transfer agent services to institutional clients like those named above. It provides these services in North American cities including Boston, New York City, Kansas City, Toronto, and Irvine, California, and in many international financial centers such as London, Frankfurt, Munich, Cologne, Vienna, Grand Cayman, Hong Kong, Beijing, Dublin, Luxembourg, [Jersey C.I.] and Tokyo. It has recently outsourced or offshored parts of its operations to joint venture operations in Mumbai, Pune and Kraków in an effort to reduce labor costs and match competitor custodians and wall street firms following the same strategy.
State Street also provides "middle office" services such as trading operations and a California affiliate provides reconciliation services to investment banks with the help of Syntel. State Street Syntel Services Private Limited (SSSSPL) is a joint venture entity that executes reconciliation for investment banks worldwide.

Online Job Scam Warning
State Street and State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) do not conduct job interviews via non-State Street email, instant messaging or chat rooms. Legitimate recruitment emails will contain the extension “@statestreet.com or @ssga.com.” If you have been contacted via social media channels to participate in an online interview using email, instant messaging or chat rooms for a position at State Street or SSGA, it is not legitimate.
These scams usually have one of more of the following characteristics:

They attempt first contact via email from a public domain or via a text message.
They attempt to perform an online interview via common web services.
They may impersonate State Street or SSGA individuals during the process.
They may send a check and ask for the funds to be deposited and wired to another location for the purchase of home office equipment.
They may use the State Street or SSGA trademark and logo in the process.

If you have been contacted under these circumstances please report the activity to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, which is a partnership among the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BIA), at www.ic3.gov.

Our Story


 




Our clients are looking to the future. We’re helping them get there.
We are the engine that powers the world’s investments. We hold and manage money for millions of people: our clients and their clients. We’re responsible for 11 percent* of the world’s assets.
Our clients face big challenges. Risk. Regulation. Complexity. It’s those challenges that inspire our solutions. Systems to improve efficiency. Tools that turn data into insight. Research that shapes strategies.
Large enough to serve more than 100 markets, we’re local enough to deliver on the ground. This means we’re closer to the world’s investments; closer to the communities where we operate; and closer to the clients we serve.
*State Street and McKinsey Global Institute, Global Capital Markets, June 30, 2015

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: March 21, 1996

 Portrays the dilemma faced by Marsh Carter, CEO and chairman of the board of State Street Bank, in May 1995. For the past decade, the bank earned continually expanding earnings through its rapidly growing custody business. Now, as that business matures and custodial fees erode, Carter is seeking to expand the bank's presence in higher value-added financial services. Developing these will require the bank to build new sets of organizational capabilities to leverage and integrate skills located in different divisions of the bank.

Message from Top Management  
Since establishing our business in Japan in 1991, State Street Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. (SSTB) has focused on meeting the asset servicing needs of institutional investors, such as private and public pension funds, asset managers and insurance companies.
In addition to providing traditional Japanese trustee services, we also offer outsourcing services covering back- and middle-office operations, fund accounting, and a wide range of local regulatory and client reporting. SSTB also provides global custody services as the agent of its parent company, State Street Bank and Trust Company.
SSTB’s offices in Tokyo and Fukuoka, Japan employ more than 300 professionals, and leverage the full range of capabilities available through State Street’s global network. We use our global expertise along with our clear understanding of local regulatory requirements, business practices and customer expectations, to provide innovative solutions with an extremely high standard of service.
Our client-centric approach is based on the knowledge that our success depends on the success of our clients and the growth of their businesses. As a Japanese trust bank with more than 25 years in the market, we are commited to helping our Japanese clients succeed wherever they do business in the world.
Yours sincerely,
Richard Fogarty
President & Representative Director

Custodial Accounts

We hold and safeguard your securities while you maintain the ownership. We'll take care of important tasks that tend to be overlooked.

Record keeping
Collect income
Distribute income
Timely management of maturing securities



Testamentary Trusts

A trust is specified in the terms of your will. Upon your death, your assets pass into a trust, which is then managed by a trustee.


Bill Pay Plus


For a low monthly fee, SSB Trust Department will pay your bills in a timely manner. Clients include individuals who are not able to manage their own bills, prefer not to have the burden of doing so, or take extended trips/vacations and want to make sure bills are taken care of while they are gone. You can count on Bill-Pay Plus...and us!


Living Trusts

A revocable, or living trust, is a trust that permits you to be in charge because you can:

	 


Revoke the trust at any time
Amend/revise the terms of the trust
Change beneficiaries
Avoid probate. When the trust creator dies, the directions contained in the trust can be carried out without the delay of probate, while maintaining your privacy.

 



Executor/Administrator of Estate


At times of death, families find the settling of an estate a time-consuming conflict-starting challenge. To avoid this, name State Street Bank as the executor of your estate. Corporate executors are not as susceptible to conflicts of interest with the beneficiaries and are sensitive to, but not subject to emotional considerations. 


Farm Management

In our 120 years of working with area farmers, we have developed a great depth of knowledge about all facets of the agricultural industry. Our farm management program leverages a working knowledge, life experiences and continual information streams that strengthen our farm management program.


Land Trust

Real property is held in trust for the benefit of the named beneficiaries.


Escrow Agent

Escrow is a legal arrangement in which an asset is delivered to a third party (called an escrow agent) to be held in trust pending a contingency or the fulfillment of a condition or conditions in a contract such as payment of a purchase price. Like Kind Exchange (1031)
