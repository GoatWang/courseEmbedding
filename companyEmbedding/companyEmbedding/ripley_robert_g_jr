Opening Doors for Future Generations

Bob Ripley credits Bentley with opening doors to his first job, which turned out to be at Shawmut Bank. After many years as a banking executive in wealth management, he came into his own as an entrepreneur. “I truly enjoyed developing my own business culture, which led to great client relationships,” he says of having brought a trust, tax and compliance software service to market. “It was really satisfying to help people by providing a strong business solution.”Not yet retired, the alumnus invests his time and resources in community, youth mentoring and youth ministry organizations.“Days should be filled with helping people, whether they are family or kids who need to get off the streets. There’s a lot of hurt in the world; if one is blessed with good health and finances, one should give back.”Bentley is another of Bob’s passions. He has stayed engaged with the school since his earliest days of commuting from Medford to Waltham. Along with attending many Bentley-sponsored events, he supports the Annual Fund every year with an increased leadership gift. Visiting the campus from his Cape Cod home, he enjoys meeting students and seeing firsthand that his support is a good investment.“Professors Rae Anderson and Dick Cross inspired us to think of having an exciting career, and I certainly did,” he says. “If we can connect our careers and successes to Bentley, then we should get reacquainted with our college — and give regularly if we can.”Earlier this year, revising his estate plan, Bob fulfilled a longtime dream. His generous bequest to Bentley will establish an endowed scholarship fund for students majoring in Accountancy.“I want to say thank you to the place that gave me my start. I feel obligated to pay back that opportunity, and pass it along to the next generation.”There are many ways to create a lasting legacy at Bentley. Learn more about gift planning.

Second Executive Resigns at Savings Bank


Thursday, July 19, 2012 - 5:15pm

0 Comments


A second senior executive has resigned at the Martha’s Vineyard Savings Bank. Robert G. Ripley Jr., an executive vice president who headed the Martha’s Vineyard Financial Group, the bank’s wealth management division, has left the bank effective today.Mr. Ripley confirmed yesterday that he was no longer working at the bank, but had no further comment.His resignation follows the abrupt resignation of president and chief executive officer Christopher Wells in late May.Thomas J. Sharkey, former chief financial officer at the bank, who is now interim president and chief executive officer, could not be reached comment yesterday about the resignation of Mr. Ripley.Bank trustees announced Mr. Wells’s resignation in a brief press release six weeks ago, saying only that Mr. Wells had resigned effective immediately for personal reasons.Mr. Ripley, who has a long career in banking and investment management, was named to the top spot in the wealth management division in May 2009. He is a resident of Falmouth.A community leader with a long career in banking, Mr. Wells had been at the helm of the bank since 2004, when he was named president of the Dukes County Savings Bank. In 2007 he presided over the merger of the savings bank and the Martha’s Vineyard Cooperative Bank, becoming president and chief executive officer of the newly-named Martha’s Vineyard Savings Bank.At the end of 2011 the bank had total assets of $525 million.Bank trustees said an executive search firm will be used to find a replacement for Mr. Wells.At the time of Mr. Wells’s resignation, Mr. Sharkey said the financial position of the bank remains strong. “I can adamantly say that this is unrelated to the financial condition of the bank. It’s something between Chris and the board, and if I can allay anyone’s concerns that it’s a financial thing — it is not,” he told the Gazette.
