In 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) to distribute land and promote economic growth for Alaska Natives. ANCSA provided for the establishment of thirteen regional Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) and what has now grown to over 200 village, urban, and group corporations. These regional and local corporations were tasked with dividing land, resources, and money among their shareholders, the Alaska Natives. Kavilco Incorporated is one of the smallest village corporations incorporated within the Sealaska region.
Kasaan Haidas were entitled to 23,040 acres of land near the City of Kasaan pursuant to the laws of ANCSA. November 11, 1973, marked the starting point for 120 original shareholders certified as eligible to enroll as residents of Kasaan. Through the diligence and efforts of Willard L. Jones, Robert I. Olsen, Louis A. Thompson, Rosemarie Young Ramiskey, and Robert R. Young, Kavilco was incorporated. The initial Board of Directors consisted of Della A. Dukes, Willard L. Jones, Robert O. Olsen, Estelle I. Thompson, Louis A. Thompson, Rosemarie Young Ramiskey, and Robert R. Young.
Kavilco believes that ANCSA was a progressive step forward in the best interests of the Native people because it broke with the traditional paternalistic governmental approach to dealing with the Native situation. The success or failure of “for profit” corporations was put directly into the hands of Native leaders with no interference from governmental agencies.
Kavilco has faced nearly 40 years of challenges, insight, and success, but the single event that stands out in Kavilco’s history was the shareholders vote to make dividends and land the top priority of the Corporation. To that end, Kavilco has focused its corporate strategy on achieving financial performance rather than accomplishing social goals in order to provide its shareholders with the best possible financial returns.
In 1980, it was General Manager Robert Sanders’ strategy, along with the Board’s vision and approval to invest in the financial markets that has translated into exceptional dividend distributions for original shareholders and their descendants. The Corporation conveyed one and one-half non-taxable acres of land to each original shareholder in 1985.
In 1989, Kavilco filed as a Registered Investment Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This strategy has reduced income tax liability for shareholders, as well as the Corporation, and requires a distribution of 90% of earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends.      

 

MISSION STATEMENT 
        To honor the vision and unselfish actions of our Kasaan Haida ancestors and elders, the goals of Kavilco Incorporated are to provide dividends and to preserve the assets for all generations.

RELATIONSHIP WITH RAYONIER

Kavilco strives to keep communication clear and consistent with our shareholders. If you have additional questions that are not featured here, please click on the  links to the right to find additional information.

WHEN IS THE NEXT DISTRIBUTION? HOW MUCH IS IT?
      Kavilco has been a profit-making corporation under ANCSA since 1972. Kavilco is a Registered Investment Company under the Securities and Exchange Commission Investment Company Act of 1940. Accordingly, ninety percent (90%) of all earnings must be distributed to shareholders as dividends. All dividends are declared at the sole discretion of the Kavilco Board of Directors based on current earnings and are distributed twice yearly in the spring and fall.
HOW MUCH IS KAVILCO STOCK WORTH? CAN I SELL MY STOCK?
      Kavilco Incorporated is an Alaska Native corporation governed by the rules and regulations of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. According to the Act, these shares may not be sold, assigned, hypothecated or transferred (except through gifting, death, or court order). There is no par value assigned to the stock, it is not publicly traded and therefore has no market value.
ARE MY DIVIDENDS EXEMPT FROM FEDERAL LIENS?
        A policy change at the Internal Revenue Service, June 1, 2005 could mean that Alaska Native shareholder dividends are no longer exempt from Federal tax liens.
        For 20-plus years, the IRS honored a moratorium on imposing tax levies on the dividends of Alaska Native corporations and who owed government taxes. The moratorium was intended to allow roughly 200 Native corporations, created as part of a land claims settlement, time to develop financial stability.

With the tax levy, the IRS could begin to attach liens to shareholders’ dividends for past due Federal income tax. However, the agency has not started enforcing the new policy in an effort to give shareholders time to be notified. Source: Native American Law Report, June 2005.

WHO ARE CLASS A AND CLASS B SHAREHOLDERS?
        Class A (voting shares) can only be issued to a person who is an Alaska Native or a descendent of an Alaska Native. Nonvoting Class B shares are issued to non-Native persons who inherit stock.
WHAT IS SECTION 7 (i)?
        Section 7 (i) is a provision of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which states that each of the 12 regional corporations in Alaska must share with the others 70 percent of its income from developing its natural resources. Annually, these revenues are pooled together and then are apportioned back to the regional corporations on a per capita basis. Kavilco shareholders have received all Section 7 (i) distributions in the form of a Kavilco dividend.

TO WHOM MAY I GIFT MY SHARES?
        You may gift any number of your shares to a child, grandchild, great grandchild, niece or nephew, brother or sister.
WHO MAY I NAME ON MY TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITION?
        The Testamentary Disposition is a form that indicates who will receive your shares upon your death. You may leave your shares to any person or any entity when you die. Kavilco encourages you to keep your testamentary disposition current.
WHAT PROTECTIONS AND RIGHTS DO THE "1991 AMENDMENTS" PROVIDE?
        The “1991 Amendments” to ANCSA became law on February 3, 1988. They provide several critical protections for Native corporations.


LAND PROTECTIONS: Land cannot be taxed unless or until developed, cannot be taken through adverse possession or by creditors unless mortgaged, cannot be lost through bankruptcy, and cannot be lost if the corporation is voluntarily dissolved. However, in the Investment Company Act of 1940, under the liquidation provision, all assets, including the land must be sold.

STOCK RESTRICTIONS: Corporation stock cannot be sold, pledged as collateral, traded or taken away to pay a debt (except through gifting, death or court order).

STOCK OPTIONS/BENEFITS (by shareholder vote): If shareholders approve, stock can be issued to shareholder descendants or elders. ANCSA corporations can create an Elders Settlement Trust. New shares can be issued in a number of varieties, including voting/non-voting, preferred stock, life estate stock and others. To date, Kavilco shareholders have not authorized the issuance of any new stock.

 OTHER ISSUES: Welfare eligibility in Alaska is not affected by dividends unless the amount of dividends exceeds $2,000 in one year. Native corporations qualify as minority businesses and are allowed to give preference to shareholders when hiring.


WHO CAN I CONTACT FOR A BUSINESS LOAN OR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO START MY OWN BUSINESS?
Kavilco does not offer business development loans or technical assistance. For loan information contact the following organizations:


Branch of Financial Assistance
          Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
          Juneau Office
          Phone: 800.645.8397 or 907.586.7183

Kavilco Incorporated is a southeast Alaska Native village corporation created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1973 with 120 original shareholders.
The Kavilco name was created with much thought. KA came from the Kasaan; VIL represents the Native Village of Kasaan; and CO represents the Company. Kasaan (Gasa'aan) is the only known permanent Haida village on the east coast of Prince of Wales Island, located on the north shore of Skowl Arm. Kasaan is a Tlingit word meaning “only place that looked good” or “pretty place,” but can also be translated as “town on a rock.”
Kavilco’s plaque and logo reads “Hale Alaska Indian Descendants All” which stands for HAIDA. Carved on the plaque are mountains, a long house, a totem, and water. The mountains represent future revenues as well as hunting areas. The long house and totem represents the past. The blue water is the fishing area around the Village of Kasaan from which our ancestors made their living.
In 1989, Kavilco Incorporated began operating as a Registered Investment Company, as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940.
