All marketing is performance marketing: Ashu Garg - Which-50














































































 





































































Digital Marketing
All marketing is performance marketing: Ashu Garg

 Andrew Birmingham
/
 June 22, 2017









 Andrew Birmingham 2017-06-22

All marketing is performance marketing, says Ashu Garg, General Partner at Foundation Capital, an investor with a long pedigree in advertising and marketing technology.
Foundation Capital’s bets include such well-known businesses as AdRoll, Responsys (acquired by Oracle)  and TubeMogul (which was subsequently acquired by Adobe). Its most recent investment was made this month, into TV analytics business Conviva.
The company and Garg are very well respected. However, it is fair to say that Garg’s views on the relative merits of performance versus brand are not without controversy.
Garg is more than happy to defend his position. “There is nothing like pure branding, unless you are talking about TV, and even that will change in the next five years.”
Ashu Garg, General Partner, Foundation Capital
We interviewed Garg in the company’s San Mateo headquarters in preparation for a research piece we were developing for AdRoll on the merger of advertising technology and marketing technology.

Download “The Convergence of AdTech and MarTech”

The conversation quickly turned to the matter of measuring success, and the orentiation of different brands when it comes to performance.
According to Garg, there are three different axes on which to assess the way a company might market.
One axis is scale, and especially the number of customers a company has.
Another is the level of engagement a brand has with its clients, which in turn drives decisions about whether brands are are likely to be attracted to performance-based business models or more traditional licence- or annuity-based models.
“If you are a retailer in finance, then you are truly direct B2C. However, if you are in CPG then you are unlikely to have direct customer contact. You are more B2B2C. The third bucket is true B2B.”
The third axis is performance orientation, he says.
Many companies like to consider themselves performance-focused, he says, but the truth is more nuanced. Performance-oriented brands tends to be more sophisticated because they need to be, due to the maturity of technology at the moment, he suggests.
“They are much more likely to have in-house expertise,” says Garg. “SaaS is not like a self-driving car. That may be the vision, but at the moment if you want to get the performance out of the software you need people who know how to turn the knobs and dials. Sophisticated perofrmance marketing organisations have those people.”
He also flags trouble ahead for some in the agency world, saying that genuinely performance-focused marketers are more likely to want to control their own programmatic destiny.
“In fact, by definition, if you use an agency you are not a true performance marketer.”

All marketing is performance marketing: Ashu Garg





























































Ashu Garg - Foundation Capital





































































General partner
Ashu Garg













































What he does: Partners with startups to solve complex challenges
The Rubik’s Cube was originally advertised as having billions of combinations but only one solution. At age 11, Ashu found that solution in 25 seconds flat. Although Ashu hasn’t picked up a Rubik’s Cube in quite a while, he still takes great pleasure in solving complex business challenges.
To give just one example, in 2010, an early stage Berkeley-based company that specialized in analytics wanted to get into the media buying platform business. Ashu helped their small team reach the growing number of brands that were migrating their television advertising to the web. That company, otherwise known as, TubeMogul soon became the leading video advertising platform for brand advertisers and later went public in 2014.
What he invests in: Ashu works with startups in sectors as varied as marketing technology (MarTech), big data, analytics, online financial services, and education.
Ashu serves on the boards of directors of TubeMogul, Localytics, Conviva, ZeroStack, Yozio, FundsIndia.com, and IndiaHomes.com. In addition, he served on the boards of Aggregate Knowledge, until it was acquired by Neustar in late 2013, Spotzot, until it was acquired by Valassis, and TreeHouse Education, which is now a public company. Ashu was also closely involved with Foundation Capital’s investment in FreeWheel, which was acquired by Comcast in 2014. Ashu has led seed investments in Robin Systems, Shopular, BrightSky Labs, adRise, IntroHQ, Next Force Technology, and Bay Sensors and has personally invested in Reflektion, Databricks, Cohesity, Jhana, Virtual Power Systems, and Vienova.
Before joining Foundation Capital in 2008, Ashu was the General Manager for Microsoft’s online advertising business. Previously, Ashu worked at McKinsey & Company with early and growth-stage companies in digital media, software, and consumer services. Earlier in his career, Ashu started TringTring.com, one of the first search engines in Asia, set up Unilever’s Nepal operations, and led the marketing and pre-sales teams at Cadence Design Systems.
Profile: Ashu has lived in India, Nigeria, and the Sudan, and today makes his home in California with his wife, Pooja (an entrepreneur as well), and their two sons.
Training: Ashu has a bachelor’s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi and an MBA from the Indian Institute of Management at Bangalore, where he received the President’s Gold Medal
