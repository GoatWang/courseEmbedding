Curtis Ling – Making Things Happen

 

 

Curtis Ling
MSE EE ’90, PhD EE ’93
CTo and Co-founder, MaxLinear 


Asked what makes an entrepreneur, Curtis Ling, CTO and co-founder of the company MaxLinear, responded, “An entrepreneur starts from nothing, has an idea, and makes that possibility become a reality.”

His first taste of this was in his early electrical engineering classes, with a few professors who were “fantastic,” recalled Curtis. “We were building things and solving problems, and there was no one to tell you what you could and couldn’t do. It was very empowering.”
His interest in entrepreneurship grew when, as a graduate student at U-M, he helped his advisor, also new to Michigan, build a lab and research group from scratch. After Michigan, he joined the faculty of the then-recently established Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. As an early faculty member, he was given the freedom to develop his research and shape the new department.
In 1999, he returned to California to gain industry experience in product development, and joined a startup called Silicon Wave to help build the world’s first single-chip Bluetooth transceiver. The company was an engineering success, but a business failure, partly because the company didn’t choose the correct markets. Its assets were ultimately acquired by Qualcomm, which successfully took the Bluetooth chips to volume production. In 2003, he and seven other colleagues left to start their own company, which became MaxLinear
 MaxLinear – From Startup to Global Player
Having helped build a lab and a department, it was time to build a company. “MaxLinear was founded by eight of us in 2003. At the time, we didn’t know what ideas made sense to pursue, but we knew we had a team which could design great products. And we knew that good marketing was critical to determining what products to work on,” stated Dr. Ling.
To boot-strap the company, the team raised its own funding from several sources including their own money, revenue from consulting services, and by not paying themselves. With this capital, they began to market the company on their own and visited a number of companies overseas. It was during one of these visits that Panasonic became intrigued by their idea of a low-power, single-chip television receiver, precipitating MaxLinear’s transition from consulting to product development. Once they had a prototype, the team was able to attract venture funding in 2004.
Today, MaxLinear is headquartered in Carlsbad, CA, employs 230 people, and has offices across Asia and Europe. The company builds highly integrated RF mixed-signal broadband communication systems on a single chip. The combination of high performance with small silicon die size and low power consumption makes their products very competitive. They were among the first companies, if not the first, to build these broadband products in a generic CMOS process, benefiting from high gate density and low cost. Their products are found in cable and set top boxes, digital televisions, cell phones, cable modems, computers, and cars.
Curtis is now focused on finding the best talent for his company. He’ll say that everything else follows from that. “I guess that’s what any great organization, such as U-M, focuses on. If you seek excellence, if you want to reach your potential, if you have a lot of drive, then you’re welcome.”
Advice for Students
“Advice is of limited use – ultimately you have to make your own mistakes,” Curtis says. But among the principles he believes in is that people shouldn’t place themselves inside a box when they begin their careers. “Entrepreneurship showed me how unimportant it was to pick a career path or a job description and then try to fit into it. Instead, I was able to discover my own unique footprint.”
He encourages students to be comfortable taking some risks in pursuit of their passion, despite the chance of what may appear to be failure. “Failure is an essential part of success. That’s what makes our country great – we not only tolerate failure, we value it. Be afraid of not learning enough, or not working with the best people. Don’t be afraid of failure, which is frequently success in disguise.”
“And protect your health.” One of Curtis’ favorite memories of Michigan was the time he spent training for the Detroit marathon, which he ran four times. He recalled training in the cool fall weather, running on dirt roads by rural farms and simply enjoying the scenery. Curtis is also an avid cyclist and traveler, and fondly recalls his ride from Tibet to Nepal. Add to these passions his love of photography, music, and languages, and it’s easy to understand why Curtis says, “There’s a lot to love about life.”

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
MaxLinear was founded in 2003[1] in Carlsbad, California[3] by "eight semiconductor industry veterans."[2] Kishore Seendripu was co-founder, and would become chairman, president, and chief executive. Among other companies, in the past Seendripu had worked on the technical staff at Broadcom.[1] Prior to 2009, the majority of the company's revenue was from the sale of its "mobile handset digital television receivers" which contained MaxLinear's digital television RF receiver chips, in Japan. The biggest customers for the product were Panasonic, Murata, and MTC[disambiguation needed]. However, in 2009, the company sold more chips for use in digital set top boxes in Europe, automotive navigation displays, and digital TVs.[2] In 2009, the company shipped 75 million chips to companies such as Panasonic and Sony,[4] with 99 percent of its sales in Asia.[2]
In November 2009, MaxLinear announced it intended to go public.[1] At the time of the IPO, MaxLinear’s venture investors included Mission Ventures in San Diego, U.S. Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and UMC Capital.[5] MaxLinear raised around $35 million in venture capital prior to the IPO, spending around half of it. By the end of 2009, the company had $17.9 million in cash.[1] That year, MaxLinear had $51.4 million in revenue and $4.3 million in profit.[1]
IPO[edit]
The company held an initial public offering on March 24, 2010[1][5] on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[3] under the ticker symbol MXL. Initially the company expected to raise around $43 million with the IPO, with that projection later raised to $90 million after a last-minute increase in share price by the company.[5] Writes the San Diego Union-Tribune, "shares soared 34 percent on their debut. MaxLinear collected about $92 million from the offering, with its shares opening at $14 and peaking at $18.70 on the first day of trading."[1] After the debut, MaxLinear said it planned to use the proceeds for "general corporate purposes," and perhaps for acquiring competitor businesses or products.[4]
Recent[edit]
By May 2010, the company employed 135 people.[1] In May 2015, MaxLinear acquired Entropic Communications. In April 2016, MaxLinear bought Microsemi's wireless backhaul business, adding about 30 workers to its workforce. In May 2016, MaxLinear announced it would buy Broadcom's "wireless backhaul infrastructure for 80 million in cash," in what was its second acquisition for the year. In the Broadcom deal, MaxLinear took on about 120 additional employees.[3] On March 29, 2017, MaxLinear Inc. announced it would buy Exar Corporation for about $661.6 million cash.[6] As of 2017, MaxLinear is on the Multimedia over Coax Alliance board of directors as well as Arris, Broadcom, Comcast, Cox Communications, DirecTV, Echostar, Intel, and Verizon.[7]
Facilities and employees[edit]
MaxLinear is based in Carlsbad, California,[3] with research and development centers in Irvine, California, China and India.[citation needed] A "fabless" company, it uses outside chipmaking facilities, known as foundries or fabs, to manufacture its chips.[citation needed] By 2010, it used "third-party contractors in Asia for manufacturing and assembly," with all its chips made by United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) at foundries in Taiwan and Singapore.[2] As of early March 2010, the company had 177 employees, with most in R&D.[2]
Products[edit]
MaxLinear sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), module makers and original design manufacturers (ODMs).[citation needed] The San Diego Union-Tribune writes that "MaxLinear’s product is very small radio-frequency TV tuner chips — half the size of an individual dial button on the keypad of a cell phone."[4] According to Xconomy, "MaxLinear focuses on designing semiconductor chips that enable people to watch TV on devices with a wireless broadband connection."[5] The "tiny chips"[1] are further described as "high-performance radio frequency (RF) systems-on-a-chip for receiving and processing digital TV broadcasts, digital videos, and broadband data downloads," in order to "enable people to watch TV on a handheld wireless device."[2]
San Diego Union-Tribune writes that the company aims to "take over from bulky 'can' tuners in TVs and other electronics. It plans to get its chips into computers, set-top boxes, mobile phones and in-vehicle video systems."[4] Most of its customers were in Europe and Japan as of 2010, where the chips are used in "analog-to-digital set-top boxes."[4] They are also used in televisions, mobile phones, computers,[1] terrestrial digital[citation needed] and cable set-top boxes, car video systems,[1] DOCSIS 3.0 voice and data cable modems, digital televisions, and netbooks.[citation needed] The company designs its analog and mixed-signal circuits in standard CMOS process technology for low-cost manufacturing.[1]
Collaborations[edit]
In April 2013, SES S.A. announced the development by Inverto, Abilis and MaxLinear Inc of a prototype Sat-IP LNB (IP-LNB), which was demonstrated at a conference held at SES' headquarters in Luxembourg. The IP-LNB incorporates eight-channel satellite-to-IP bridging technology to deliver eight concurrent channels via IP unicast or multicast to fixed and portable client devices. As of July 2012, the prototype IP-LNB was being developed into a commercial product.[8]

MaxLinear sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), module makers and original design manufacturers (ODMs).[citation needed] The San Diego Union-Tribune writes that "MaxLinear’s product is very small radio-frequency TV tuner chips — half the size of an individual dial button on the keypad of a cell phone."[4] According to Xconomy, "MaxLinear focuses on designing semiconductor chips that enable people to watch TV on devices with a wireless broadband connection."[5] The "tiny chips"[1] are further described as "high-performance radio frequency (RF) systems-on-a-chip for receiving and processing digital TV broadcasts, digital videos, and broadband data downloads," in order to "enable people to watch TV on a handheld wireless device."[2]
San Diego Union-Tribune writes that the company aims to "take over from bulky 'can' tuners in TVs and other electronics. It plans to get its chips into computers, set-top boxes, mobile phones and in-vehicle video systems."[4] Most of its customers were in Europe and Japan as of 2010, where the chips are used in "analog-to-digital set-top boxes."[4] They are also used in televisions, mobile phones, computers,[1] terrestrial digital[citation needed] and cable set-top boxes, car video systems,[1] DOCSIS 3.0 voice and data cable modems, digital televisions, and netbooks.[citation needed] The company designs its analog and mixed-signal circuits in standard CMOS process technology for low-cost manufacturing.[1]
Collaborations[edit]
In April 2013, SES S.A. announced the development by Inverto, Abilis and MaxLinear Inc of a prototype Sat-IP LNB (IP-LNB), which was demonstrated at a conference held at SES' headquarters in Luxembourg. The IP-LNB incorporates eight-channel satellite-to-IP bridging technology to deliver eight concurrent channels via IP unicast or multicast to fixed and portable client devices. As of July 2012, the prototype IP-LNB was being developed into a commercial product.[8]

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
MaxLinear was founded in 2003[1] in Carlsbad, California[3] by "eight semiconductor industry veterans."[2] Kishore Seendripu was co-founder, and would become chairman, president, and chief executive. Among other companies, in the past Seendripu had worked on the technical staff at Broadcom.[1] Prior to 2009, the majority of the company's revenue was from the sale of its "mobile handset digital television receivers" which contained MaxLinear's digital television RF receiver chips, in Japan. The biggest customers for the product were Panasonic, Murata, and MTC[disambiguation needed]. However, in 2009, the company sold more chips for use in digital set top boxes in Europe, automotive navigation displays, and digital TVs.[2] In 2009, the company shipped 75 million chips to companies such as Panasonic and Sony,[4] with 99 percent of its sales in Asia.[2]
In November 2009, MaxLinear announced it intended to go public.[1] At the time of the IPO, MaxLinear’s venture investors included Mission Ventures in San Diego, U.S. Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and UMC Capital.[5] MaxLinear raised around $35 million in venture capital prior to the IPO, spending around half of it. By the end of 2009, the company had $17.9 million in cash.[1] That year, MaxLinear had $51.4 million in revenue and $4.3 million in profit.[1]
IPO[edit]
The company held an initial public offering on March 24, 2010[1][5] on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[3] under the ticker symbol MXL. Initially the company expected to raise around $43 million with the IPO, with that projection later raised to $90 million after a last-minute increase in share price by the company.[5] Writes the San Diego Union-Tribune, "shares soared 34 percent on their debut. MaxLinear collected about $92 million from the offering, with its shares opening at $14 and peaking at $18.70 on the first day of trading."[1] After the debut, MaxLinear said it planned to use the proceeds for "general corporate purposes," and perhaps for acquiring competitor businesses or products.[4]
Recent[edit]
By May 2010, the company employed 135 people.[1] In May 2015, MaxLinear acquired Entropic Communications. In April 2016, MaxLinear bought Microsemi's wireless backhaul business, adding about 30 workers to its workforce. In May 2016, MaxLinear announced it would buy Broadcom's "wireless backhaul infrastructure for 80 million in cash," in what was its second acquisition for the year. In the Broadcom deal, MaxLinear took on about 120 additional employees.[3] On March 29, 2017, MaxLinear Inc. announced it would buy Exar Corporation for about $661.6 million cash.[6] As of 2017, MaxLinear is on the Multimedia over Coax Alliance board of directors as well as Arris, Broadcom, Comcast, Cox Communications, DirecTV, Echostar, Intel, and Verizon.[7]
