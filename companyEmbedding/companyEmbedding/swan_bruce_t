 “We started reading Black Swan and couldn’t put down our Kindle until the last word.”[Brain Pickings]2009 Sidewise Award NomineeBruce Sterling brings us a tale of espionage, cyber-threats, alternate realities and intrigue in “Black Swan”, a dark and cyberpunk novelette.Luca is a technology blogger looking for anything newsworthy. ‘Massimo Montaldo’ is the nickname of hacker living on the fringe of society. What can happen when these two very different people meet each other?Massimo has discovered something, something that could shift the balance of power among the superpowers of the world. A Black Swan. What is a Black Swan? “A black swan, when it arrives, cannot even be recognized as a black swan. When the black swan assaults us, with the wingbeats of some rapist Jupiter, then we must rewrite history.”As a journalist, Luca must investigate, learn the truth – or should he? What if this is all beyond him, beyond his ability to fully grasp? Memristors? Euro-Liras? Spies and the possibility of an Alternate Italy?What if the risk is too high, the danger too great?Warring between what is safe and what is right, Luca had to decide if reporting the truth is worth the risk…ABOUT THE AUTHORMichael Bruce Sterling (born April 14, 1954) is an American science fiction author, best known for his novels and his work on the Mirrorshades anthology, which helped define the cyberpunk genre."Black Swan" is a novelette. 9250 words.

thought provoking read

  This is an interesting story about a technology journalist who receives the greatest tipoff in his career, only to be taken into an alternate universe.It is thought provoking about what events do and do not shape our histories and what alternative histories might exist. The story revolves around the much touted idea of a black swan event, which totally disrupts the sequence of history - or the absence of such events.The writing is a bit rough in places and at times I had reread sections to establish the flow of events. But this made up for by the imaginative content.I have one general gripe with alternate universe stories. Why is it that authors propose that alternative universes are going to be populated by genetically identical people, living very different lives? Patterns of probability suggest that if alternate universes existed, the societies may have some general resemblance, but the chances of two people being genetically the same are very, very low. Anyway, there is a little twist in this story which might just redeem the storyline from this problem.

  Black Swan is the story of two men in two of many alternate-reality Turins, that can be traversed using a properly configured laptop. About half the story is like the start of a fairly typical journalist-accidentally-uncovers-gigantic-political-scandal, but then dragged by a possible informer from one Turin to another, our hero suddenly becomes as a wooden statue, offering no insights or even personal opinions about the differences.  The story ends abruptly and inexplicably as if Sterling just got sick of it.The writing isn't exactly the best either.  There are a few passages where the dialogue seemed downright amateurish.  I know some writers try to reproduce in English the particular flair of Italian.  Michael Dibdin could do it.  Sterling can't.

  The book is about an encounter of a technology blogger with his secret informer. The encounter starts off with a large tip from the informer that could potentially change the path of technology but sharply delves into multiple universes and what makes them so different.The book is thought provoking in terms of how histories are shaped and how major changes in the course of history might be triggered by events that one might least expect.However, the plot is flimsy and apart from the philosophical undertone it offers nothing exciting. Do not buy this book if you are looking for a regular cyberpunk plot.

  Nope, no spoilers here, but this short story is worth way more than the two bucks i payed to download it, for it is an existential mind-ogle. Such to the scale that I would like to see it made into a movie, or better yet a full length novel. Sterling still has "it", if you are a fan and haven't read this, do it now. If you are not a fan, but enjoy dystopian post-industrial age cyberthrillers then you will enjoy this and at this price, how can it be wrong.

  This would be an excellent starting place for anyone who has never read Bruce Sterling before! The prose is well written, the story is interesting (and pretty short), and it leaves you hanging with what could very well be considered an excellent cosmic joke. If you like this story, you should immediately go out and read more Bruce Sterling! If not, well, you know….

               WPKN is a 10,000-watt non-commercial radio station founded in 1963 as the college radio station of the University of Bridgeport. While our studios and offices remain on the campus of the University of Bridgeport, in 1989 we became an independent, non-profit 501 (c)3 corporation. Since then WPKN has been a listener-supported community radiostation, broadcasting at 89.5 FM. WPKN can also be heard streaming live on the internet at www.wpkn.org, is listed under the "Eclectic" category on iTunes Radio, and has become available on many mobile tuning apps. Initially established to serve the needs of the residents of Bridgeport's local educational institutions, WPKN's terrestrial signal now serves a potential listenership of 1.5 million people in Connecticut, Long Island, and parts of New York and Massachusetts. Programs on WPKN include live and recorded music, news, public affairs, and spoken word. WPKN's volunteer programmers present a wide variety of music and alternative information, in an eclectic mix of free-form programming that seeks to serve those whose needs are not met by mainstream media in a unique and vibrant way. WPKN's programming mix is a cornucopia of genres and styles. From the obscure to the recognizable, it is presented by informed programmers who help listeners discover and rediscover the best in live and recorded performance. Some of our self-produced talk/news oriented shows, such as Between the Lines, are nationally recognized. WPKN is proud of its bold independence and its fearlessness to program without any strings attached. Generations of our dedicated and loyal audience have defined us as the real alternative to an increasingly homogenous and limited choice in broadcast radio. WPKN's programs are not intended to duplicate that which is available on commercial, non-commercial or "public" radio stations. When the FCC licensed FM radio in 1945, it reserved the twenty channels at the lower end of the band exclusively for noncommercial use. At the time, the Commission indicated that it was doing so in order to foster "diversity of programming service", and to provide opportunity for the widest possible variety of programs. WPKN's mission has been to remain true to this original noncommercial directive, and be "The Real Alternative".
