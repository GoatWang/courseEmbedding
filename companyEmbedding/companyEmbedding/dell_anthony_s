Dell offers one of the best and most diverse laptop lineups on the market, with affordable Inspirons, sturdy Latitude business laptops, premium XPS Ultrabooks and Alienware gaming rigs. The high-end machines did great in our reviews, while most of the mainstream and budget systems were acceptable, but unexciting.

Dell's tech support is mediocre, but its excellent warranty covers shipping costs on all laptops when you need to send them in for service, and it offers a slew of extension options.
Dell’s Key Strengths

XPS: The XPS 13 and XPS 15 are still as great as they’ve ever been, with drool-worthy InfinityEdge displays, comfortable keyboards, wonderful build quality and long battery life.
Alienware: Arguably the best gaming laptops in the business, Alienware pushes the envelope with high-end performance, gorgeous designs and cutting-edge features like an OLED display.
Great warranty: If you need to send in your laptop during the one-year factory warranty period, Dell will cover the shipping costs in both directions.

Dell’s Main Weaknesses

Forgettable low-end and business models: No Inspiron, Vostro or Latitude earned a score higher than 3.5 or received an Editor’s Choice award.
Mediocre tech support: Support reps didn’t know basic information about the company's preloaded software and kept us on hold for a long time.

Top-Rated Dell Laptops

Dell XPS 13: 14+ hours of battery life and beautiful screen
Dell XPS 15: 0.6 inches thick, Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU
Alienware 17: 4K display options, lots of ports, optional graphics amp

MORE: The Best Dell Laptops

Reviews (26/35)
A trend emerged in Dell’s reviews last year. The company’s XPS 13, XPS 15 and Alienware gaming notebooks are some of the best laptops on the market, but most other products were unimpressive.
We reviewed 37 Dell laptops, five of which earned our Editors’ Choice nod (two XPS models and three Alienware). Dell’s XPS 13 2-in-1 and a few select Latitude notebooks earned 4 stars, but Dell's Vostro lineup was poor, and both the Latitude and Inspiron series laptops were merely average.
Design (13/15)
Dell continues its quest to one-up Apple at every turn, with minimalist aluminum designs in colors such as silver, gold and rose gold, like you'll find on the Dell XPS 13. But Dell gets its biggest wins with innovative designs like the XPS 13 2-in-1, which measures an incredibly slim 0.32 inches and features a barely-there InfinityEdge display.

Mid-level laptops such as the Inspiron 13 5000 and the impractically large Inspiron 17 7000 2-in-1 combine style and functionality. Dell isn't afraid to play with colors, as evidenced by the bold hues of the Inspiron 17 5000 and the Inspiron 15 7000. The company also knows how to make a rather striking business notebook (Latitude 13 7000).
On the gaming front, the Alienware 13, 15 and 17 have undergone some major design upgrades that yielded thinner, lighter, more sophisticated frames while retaining the intergalactic aesthetic that we know and love. However, outside of a few prominent redesigns, many Dell laptops are refreshes from two- or three-year-old chassis.
Support (15/20)
Dell's website has plenty of tips, how-tos, diagnostics and FAQs to help you help yourself. However, when we called for phone support, we often got phone agents who didn't know what our test laptop was capable of, telling us that our XPS 13 had no audio control software (it does) and that there's no built-in way to change the network priorities (the preloaded Killer Network Manager does just that).
Innovation (9/10)
The XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best example of Dell’s innovative spirit. This hybrid offers the same stunning, bezel-free InfinityEdge display as the regular XPS 13, but it can be used as a tablet, too. More important, Dell figured out a way to squeeze more power out of Intel’s Y Series processor; its Dynamic Power Mode delivers more speed when you need it without requiring a fan in the design. Another true standout for the brand was the addition of an OLED display to the Alienware 13, providing the most colorful images we’ve ever seen from a gaming laptop.
Value and Selection (15/15)
Dell easily has the most diverse lineup of any laptop maker, including strong entries in the mainstream consumer, business and gaming markets. Its catalog includes super-tough systems like its Rugged Extreme notebooks, productivity powerhouses like the Latitude 7280 and affordable laptops like the pint-size Inspiron 11 3000. The company's Alienware gaming laptops are always among the very best in the industry.
Warranty (5/5)
All Dell laptops come with limited one-year warranties, and unlike some competitors, the company covers all shipping costs if you need to send a product in for service.
Upgrading your RAM or storage drive does not void your warranty. Dell also gets points for offering a wide variety of extended-warranty options, which include increasing the length up to four or five years with on-site service and adding accidental-damage protection.

Do not buy Dell if you travel abroad.
Dell as most US based company do not give a s$#t about worldwide service.
Try you cannot even contact Dell International only if you are a US citizen and you are located there too.
I purchased a 2-in-1 with 3 years of "next business day" warranty which day passed about 5 months ago.
The technical problem was "taken care" by the Israeli Dell representative so after ruining the laptop I have to organize the swap with them too. Meantime I travelled to Belgium, England and South Africa too, but I have to deal with the slightly retarded Israeli tech-support and they have an issue understanding why I won't accept half the resolution, RAM and warranty compared to the one I paid for.
I had Dell computers in the past but after 5 months to get my laptop or money back, I get back to a different brand. Gave up on them.
I will spend my time blogging about this issue and raise awareness how bad this company is.
If any Dell worker ever reads it, here is an official SWAP DPS 25319257672

Dell is a horrible company. It is like Ponzi scheme - they sell stuff and fight with you when it does not work and pay employees to put good ratings on the internet.  They are like the insurance companies that deny all claims until you literally have to get a lawyer and sue them.  Mailing computers is stupid anyway, because they get shaken up and thrown around.  It is time US Citizens stood up for themselves and use their hard earned money to buy well made computers that actually last for years.  Also, the software and hardware changes all the time and we are supposed to buy new stuff constantly, we are all going broke and filling the landfills.  I hate dell. They ripped me off with a lemon I paid $1,577 dollars for and it has never worked for more than a few months at a time. Buyer Beware!!!! They expect you to pay, pay, pay for warranties, etc. and the machines are designed to fail.  If you get one that actually works, it was an accident.  The people in India never contact supervisors – they put the phone down and say the same thing – I just checked and I am sorry but there is nothing we can do – or they say they will submit the complaint and someone will call you and when they call back, it is just the same person saying I just checked and I am sorry but there is nothing we can do.

I have had a Dell XPS 15 model 9530 Laptop for les than a year. I can honestly say that it is the biggest piece of crap I have ever owned. The video driver crashes daily, I have had tickets open with Dell support on this issue from day one. They have updated the video drivers and BIOS multiple times, they replaced the AC Adapter, and a week ago they replaced the Motherboard, now this ten month old turd won't even power on. Dell is once again replacing the Motherboard and the AC Adapter, as soon as I can get this piece of crap running again, I am going to back up my data and sell it. I will never own another Dell product There computers are cheap rubbish!

What happened to Dell? I am in the middle of laptop hell trying to: first get a laptop ordered, then when it arrived it did not turn on, then when I went to support they have my service tag id assigned to the wrong computer model, so support will not help me. 
I have had a Dell computers for years, so I figured when I needed a new one I would get a Dell. Big mistake. First ordering the computer took almost 4 hours with many calls to sales support. The web site would not let me put into my cart what I ordered. Then when I finally got my cart almost correct (gave up trying to get what I really wanted) it would not let me checkout. Finally had to email what I wanted to sales support and they entered the info.
2 weeks later the computer arrived and failed to boot. So I called Dell support, they kept telling me the computer model they had on record for the service tag Id, of my new computer, did not match the  model of the computer recieved, so they could not help me. I spent the next hour getting bounced from person to person until the call just ended on the Dell side. I called back and managed to get someone that did want to help. We got the computer booted up (battery issue) but then there was no wireless. They never installed the drivers. So now I have a computer that will not connect to the internet. This has been a terrible experience and I hope to send the computer back tomorrow for a refund. Something has gone terribly wrong at Dell. DO NOT BUY A DELL COMPUTER!

How much did Dell pay you for this review? STAY AWAY FROM DELL. I've been a customer of Dell since their beginning. They started out really good. The last two laptops I bought from them were lemons. I decided to try again because I was a loyal customer. Maybe it was just those last two laptops. So I purchased another one. This one was by far the worst. The weird bizarre problems that come up range from being unable to start the laptop sometimes. Sometimes certain keys on the keyboard stop working for days and then it will clear up and start working again. This last laptop I bought from Dell is my very last. and hopefully I can help someone avoid save money and headache by avoiding Dell entirely. You'd seriously be better off with Asus.

I had three Dell laptops through work. 

First one was huge, built like a tank and bomb proof. 

Second one was small,  built like a small tank and bomb proof.

Third one was the biggest lemon I have ever seen in the world of computing equipment. 

Plagued with missing driver issues which Dell tech corporate support took months to resolve.

Then over the next 18 months, five, yes - FIVE screen replacements, one motherboard replacement, (and a partridge in a pear tree).

I ended up saying to our IT department saying I refused to take it back a sixth time and they should tell Dell to stick it somewhere. They gave me a Toshiba. 

Maybe I was just unlucky but, five screens and a motherboard on a 2 year old laptop and they dont offer a replacement??

Never again.

The computer that I bought has served me well except for one thing: the charger THAT CAME WITH THE PRODUCT is supposedlyt not compatible with hte computer. Sometimes it works, but two thirds of the time it says some nonsense about the charger being unknown and that the computer won't work properly before snailing through basic processes and refusing to charge like a grumpy schoolboy. I'm left trying to reinsert it repeatedly as if I was haplessly playing a game of Doctor and worried that the alarm was going to go off. Dell's decision to try and force everyone to buy all of their replacement parts at high rice from them by making everything else incompatible in faux iitation of apple is pathetic and they should get over themselves. I will continue to use this computer, but I will probably never buy another one unless I absolutely have to, essentially because I hate the company.

Bought two DELL Inspirons, a 17 inch that died two months after purchase  under warranty thankfully, and motherboard was replaced, and a 5547 (multiple issues, touchpad, hinge, low range WIFI) that died as soon as the warranty expired. Decided not to replace motherboard as it would had been $200 and who know how long before it would fail again. I ended up buying a Lenovo G50-80 as we have another one in the family that is very fast and with zero issues. DELL used to be good, no more.

The business range look great. However, from experience, I'd avoid the cheap consumer laptops as they are very flimsy and underpowered for the OS they come bundled with. Not a company to buy a budget machine from.

I have bough a Dell laptop for the second time in January this year. In less then 6 months Dell had to change the hard drive twice and the mother board. Out of those 6 months I was without my laptop for over 5 weeks. Barely an apology was given, of course neither any reasons or compensation ( at least an extended warranty ), as they NEVER admitted my equipment was faulty. I have sent 3 complaints - emails and post - in the past 5 weeks and have just received a final rude email, which is published below. No one bothered to reply..
One of the worst customer service. It just proves Dell is happy for individual customers to buy their products, but just pray nothing wrong happens, if you are not a corporate company, where they will bend backward to get your Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£. We are too small fish.

***********************
I write to you on behalf of Dellâ€™s Executive Customer Support Team and we are the single point of contact for all correspondence (emails/letters/fax), received at any of our worldwide corporate offices addressed to our executives.

Please note, Dell has assisted you as per the warranty and we regret to inform you that we will be unable to compensate for any time or data loss. As communicated before, as much as we aspire to offer computers/ printers which are fault free, technical issues with computers/ printers could arise and one can have the system serviced according to warranty policy.

Please note this is the last point of escalation and this is Dells final position in the matter. We are not in a position to offer you any compensation. We also believe the Courts will look on this as a reasonable offer. Should you wish to bring a claim against Dell we must inform you we will defend our position.

I regret you feel your experience with Dell on this occasion has not met with your expectations.

Of course I am available should you wish to discuss the, matter any further.

Regards,

Dell's customer service is the worst I've ever experienced.  What is up with selling computers that don't have ethernet ports?  What is up with keeping customers on telephone hold for 3 to 4 hours, not resolving the issues and not providing adequate technical support?  Before you know it , your warranty is up, seemingly only because they kept you on hold for so long.  No more dells for me ever.

Laptop still does not work and Dell is saying the return period is up. I can't believe Dell has back slid so much. I will never purchase another Dell product.

Made the mistake of buying a Dell laptop directly from Dell online. The monitor and other hardware failed within 3 months after only minimal use. I sent it back and the returned it to me "still broken". Spent between 7PM and midnight on the phone with incredibly UN-knowledgeable tech support people who seemed to be trying to wear us down and giving us the run-around. We were patient and kind with them. We finally turned Dell in to both Federal and Local Government Consumer affairs for an investigation. In the mean time, $399 down the drain with a computer that is under a year old and supposedly still under warranty.

i just acquired my first Dell - an Inspiron 14-3451. I found it extremely slow and the drive was chattering almost continuously. I called Tech Support (Philippines) and went through hours of troubleshooting - including a reset. The problems persisted so the tech sent a replacement drive THAT I HAD TO INSTALL. they also sent a thumb drive with the operating system. - FOR ME TO INSTALL. The laptop has no internet now nor does it have an Ethernet port. NOW WHAT DO THEY WANT ME TO DO!!!!!! I am awaiting the next email from them. I will never buy a Dell in the future and will recommend the same to anyone who will listen. SHAME ON DELL

Don't Buy Dell Says:


April 27th, 2015 at 7:59 am

DONâ€™T BUY DELL â€“ FAULTY PRODUCTS AND TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!
4 months ago, I paid $5000 for a brand new Dell 3800 laptop and 3 weeks ago it failed. Sure, these things do occasionally happen and I was only slightly perturbed when I called Dell support, and I was almost relieved when I was told that, as per my â€œnext business dayâ€ service option, a technician would promptly arrive and replace the motherboard.
3 business days later, the first technician arrived and proceeded to try and remove the back cover. However, he was so inept that he completely stripped two of the screws â€“ not just one, but two! â€œNot to worryâ€, he assured me. He would simply break the back cover to gain access. But, he would have to wait until Dell could send a replacement cover.
6 business days - he returned to wrench the back cover free from the screws he destroyed and finally replaced the motherboard. However, this â€œnewâ€ motherboard didnâ€™t work properly. The laptop started, but when he tried to turn it off, the keyboard stayed illuminated, the screen froze and there was no way of restarting. Then this supposed Dell technician actually asked me â€œDoes this model normally do that?!?â€ Trying not to choke on my complete bewilderment, I said â€œNoâ€.
So, while I waited for yet another â€œnewâ€ motherboard, I decided to call Dell to lodge a complaint. I was told to put this in writing and send it to customer service, which I did, and I promptly received an automated reply stating that I would receive a response within 8 business hoursâ€¦ But, I never heard anything.
9 business days - a second technician arrived to install yet another motherboard, which, thankfully, he managed to do without breaking anything else. However, Dell had sent the wrong screws to replace the ones stripped by the first technician.
So, I sent another mail to customer service and, once again, got the automated â€œWe will respond within 8 business hoursâ€.
12 business days â€“ I finally heard from customer service. But, not to say sorry for the terrible service Iâ€™d been receiving and not to say that my replacement screws were on the way, but just to say that my service job would be closed within 24 hours. I replied rather promptly to ask what had become of my missing screws?? 
To my surprise, this person had absolutely no knowledge of my screwed screws and asked me to supply photographic proof, which I duly did.
20 business days â€“ and still no replyâ€¦..
Paying $5000 for a laptop that fails after just 4 months is bad enough, but to get this kind of terrible service is simply insulting. Unless you have a penchant for wasting money and time â€“ DONâ€T BUY DELL!!!

I bought a DELL Studio 1749 in 2010 with an extra warranty. The power adapter went out after 2 years but it was replaced very quickly and for free thanks to the extra warranty. My computer still run good. I wonder if dell is still a good brand today, it seems expensive.

Dell laptops that they sell to large corporates are the worst thing.. They cannot even learn from Lenovo in terms of keyboard ergonomics let alone Mac. The surface edges are not rounded for a resting parm - corners can peel your skin. The Home delete keys are hidden away in the function key sequence - not prominently seperated. The key combination that lits the keyboard is not the two corner keys. To top it all, if you plugged in an ethernet cable that has the clip protector tabs, heck you cannot detach the cable without a mail opener to press the tab - thats how well they designed and tested the hinge that that bulges through out the frame of attachment between screen and base.  Whole thing weighs like a brick. Private Equity at work. Putting lipstick on a pig.

You have to wonder about a website that supposedly does precise reviews of laptops; and can't get simple math correct before publishing.

As far as Dell is concerned; tech support is pretty much useless but recently I spent some time chatting with a tech guy about a new machine and he was surprisingly knowledgeable and helpful. (I am considering a new Dell.)
