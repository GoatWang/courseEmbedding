Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.
An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement. It will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments. An annuity isn’t intended to replace emergency funds or to fund short-term savings goal.
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal.
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, and it’s sold by prospectus. You should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees and the expense of the underlying investment options.
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to specific questions.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Annuities issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio. 

Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying funds contain this and other important information.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

With a variable universal life policy, you can take advantage of potential economic growth because your policy value is invested in the stock market. Your policy also has the flexibility to adjust to your changing needs. Underlying sub-accounts are only available as investment options in variable insurance contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not offered directly to the general public.
However, it also puts greater responsibility on you - you assume the investment and mortality risks, and you select and monitor your own underlying investment options, instead of the insurance company doing it for you.
Your insurance needs may change if your personal situation changes, for example if you get married, have a child or get a promotion. Make sure that these strategies and products are suitable for your long-term life insurance needs. Also, make sure you are able to continue premium payments so your policy doesn’t lapse if the market goes down. If you take a loan, withdrawal or partial or whole surrender your death benefit may be reduced, your policy may lapse or you may face tax consequences.
There are fees and charges for variable life insurance, including a cost of insurance based on characteristics of the insured person such as gender, health and age. There may also be underlying fund charges and expenses, and additional charges for riders that customize a policy to fit your individual needs.
Before purchasing a variable life insurance policy, you should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the policy and its underlying investment options. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Click on any of the prospectus links to obtain a product prospectus. Underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by contacting Nationwide. Read the prospectus carefully before you make a purchase.
Guarantees and protections are subject to Nationwide's claims-paying ability. They don't apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying investment options. Underlying sub accounts are only available as investment options in variable insurance contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not offered directly to the general public.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Variable products are sold by prospectus. Both the product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by writing to Nationwide Life Insurance Company. P.O. Box.182021 Columbus, OH 43218-2021. Before investing, carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses contain this and other important information. Read the prospectuses carefully before investing.

Please read this important information
Keep in mind that investing involves market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Also, know that underlying investment options are only available in variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. They are not offered directly to the public.
Protections and guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing life insurance company.
Keep in mind that taking money from your policy immediately reduces both the cash value and the death benefit payable, and can cause the need for more premiums to be paid into the policy in the future. You should always take care to ensure that your life insurance needs continue to be met over time subsequent to taking cash from your policy.
Variable products are sold by prospectus. You can obtain the product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses by writing to Nationwide Life Insurance Company, P.O. Box 182021, Columbus, OH 43218-2021. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus carefully and consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Investing involves risk.
Guarantees and protections are subject to Nationwide's claims-paying ability. They do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying investment options.
Investment products are not FDIC-insured, may lose value and have no bank guarantee.
