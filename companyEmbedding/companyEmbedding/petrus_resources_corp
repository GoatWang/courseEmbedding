FINANCIAL INFORMATION

  

Item
1.   Financial Statements

 

The
Financial Statements of the Company required to be filed with this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were prepared by management and
commence on the following page, together with related
Notes.  In the opinion of management, these Financial
Statements fairly present the financial condition of the Company,
but should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements of
the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 previously filed
in a 10K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation have been included in the accompanying interim
unaudited financial statements and consist of only normal recurring
adjustments. The results of operations presented in the
accompanying interim unaudited financial statements for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results that may be expected for the full year ending
December 31, 2016.

PETRUS RESOURCES CORPORATION 

Notes to
Financial Statements

(unaudited)

June 30,
2016

 

 

NOTE
1  - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been
prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission for interim financial information and with
the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information required to be included in a complete set of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.
The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes
included in the Company's 2015 Annual Report filed with the SEC on
March 30, 2016.

 

NOTE 2
– GOING CONCERN

 

The
Company's unaudited interim financial statements are prepared using
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the
realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal
course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing
source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and
allow it to continue as a going concern. These conditions raise
substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate
capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If
the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be
forced to cease operations.

 

In order
to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other
things, additional capital resources. Management's plan is to
obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from
management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its
minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt
financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that
the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its
plans.

 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in
the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of
financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern.

NOTE 3
– RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

The
Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal
property.  The officer of the Company provides office services
without charge. At inception on March 2, 2011, the Company issued
8,000,000 common shares valued at par to our sole officer and
director as a partial repayment for expenses paid on behalf of the
company.

During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the CEO paid expenses on
behalf of the Company in the amount of $6,000. As of September 30,
2016 the Company owed advances of $24,789, to Miguel Dotres, one of
the officers of the Company. These advances are unsecured, carry no
interest and are due on demand.

 

NOTE 4
– SHARE EXCAHNGE AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

 

On March
3, 2016, we entered into a Share Exchange and Plan of
Reorganization ("Agreement" or the "Share Exchange") with The
Waters Club Worldwide, Inc. WCW is a private company incorporated
in Florida in 2014, with offices at 401 East Las Olas Blvd., Suite
1400, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301. At the closing of the
Agreement (which is contingent upon the effectiveness of this
post-effective amendment to our registration statement and a 80%
reconfirmation vote under Rule 419 and other closing conditions),
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, 8,000,000 shares of our
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share will be issued to WCW
shareholders holding 100% of the issued and outstanding common
shares of WCW. Upon completion of the foregoing transactions, (i)
WCW will become our wholly-owned subsidiary, (ii) WCW's common
stockholders will acquire 82% of our issued and outstanding common
stock in exchange for their shares of WCW Common Stock, and (iii)
we will change our name to The Waters Club Worldwide, Inc. As of
September 30 , 2016 the Agreement with WCW has not closed and was
further amended on October 28, 2016, see note 5.

 

  

NOTE 5
– SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 

On October
28, 2016, we amended the March 3, 2016 Share Exchange and Plan of
Reorganization ("Agreement" or the "Share Exchange") with The
Waters Club Worldwide, Inc. (the "Amended Agreement"). WCW is a
private company incorporated in Florida in 2014, with offices at
750 W Sunrise Blvd, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33311. At the closing
of the Amended Agreement, pursuant to the terms of the Amended
Agreement, 89,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001
per share will be issued to WCW shareholders holding 100% of WCW's
issued and outstanding common shares and 20,000,000 shares of our
Preferred Stock will be issued to the WCW shareholders holding 100%
of the WCW Preferred Stock. Upon completion of the foregoing
transactions, (i) WCW will become our wholly-owned subsidiary and
(ii) we will change our name to Waters Club Holdings,
Inc.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Donald Trump is winning the currency cold war: Pimco
