      SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
    

      Our disclosure and analysis in this press release contain some 
      forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current 
      expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these 
      statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current 
      facts. They use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” 
      “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” and other words and terms of 
      similar meaning. They also appear in any discussion of future operating 
      or financial performance. In particular, these include statements 
      relating to future actions, future performance of our products, 
      expenses, the outcome of any legal proceedings, and financial results. 
      Although we believe that we are basing our expectations and beliefs on 
      reasonable assumptions within the bounds of what we currently know about 
      our business and operations, there can be no assurance that our actual 
      results will not differ materially from what we expect or believe. Some 
      of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our 
      expectations or beliefs include, without limitation: the adverse effect 
      from a decline in the securities markets; a decline in the performance 
      of our products; a general downturn in the economy; changes in 
      government policy or regulation; changes in our ability to attract or 
      retain key employees; and unforeseen costs and other effects related to 
      legal proceedings or investigations of governmental and self-regulatory 
      organizations. We also direct your attention to any more specific 
      discussions of risk contained in our Form 10-K and other public filings. 
      We are providing these statements as permitted by the Private Litigation 
      Reform Act of 1995. We do not undertake to update publicly any 
      forward-looking statements if we subsequently learn that we are unlikely 
      to achieve our expectations or if we receive any additional information 
      relating to the subject matters of our forward-looking statements.

Agnes Mullady President & COO, Gabelli Funds By Peter Madden










As one of nine siblings, Agnes Mullady is no stranger to competition.
“It was controlled chaos,” Mullady says of growing up in a large family. “But individually we strived to do the best we could, and collectively we shared in each other’s accomplishments. And still do. It is a lot like where I work now.”
Where she works now—as the president and COO—is Gabelli Funds, a division of the Rye-based financial services firm GAMCO Investors, which was founded by celebrated investor and analyst Mario Gabelli in 1977. Mullady has overseen a $10 billion growth in the firm’s mutual fund and closed-end business—from $14.2 billion to nearly $25 billion today—since joining the firm in 2005, but she’s eager to give her colleagues all the credit.
“I work with a lot of very intelligent, highly motivated folks,” she says.
Mullady spent much of her early career in the startup world, and she says that experience serves her well in the entrepreneurial environment of Gabelli.
“I really enjoy the challenge of the test I’ve been assigned to and the diversity of the work it allows me to do,” she says. “I consider it an achievement that I enjoy my work and love what I do.”
