Typos, examples that don't work,examples that don't match the text and worseabound. As a Perl beginner, I found myselfconstantly looking beyond the book - changing the code to "what theyreally meant" and guessing about the gaps. The book leaves much of theimportant syntax a mystery.  Finally I realized theremust be a review of this book on the web.There is one by Tom Christiansen that, from myexperience, hits it head on, was fun readinggiven my enormous frustration, and told mehow misinformed I'd been even aboutfeatures that "seemed to work".

It is technically inaccurate contrary to what the apporval emblem from Michael Moncur on the back cover says. I would like to see Sams Publishing pull this book off of the shelves. It is very misleading to any programmer. I have been programming PERL for 3 years. Trust me on this one. Get Programming PERL from OReilly and Associates. It is the required PERL resource.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsInaccurate, misleading and very disappointing !Bycolin_froggatt@acuma.co.ukon October 31, 1997Format: PaperbackAs a complete novice to Perl, the cover comments and certifications looked good.  But it didn't take me long to realise that this was one of the worst computing books I've read.  Inaccurate explanations, incorrect examples, examples on the CD that don't work, sections of corrupted text, the list goes on.  I expected far better from a publisher like SAMS.  I've complained to SAMS but they havn't replied !  DON'T BUY THIS BOOK !Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsDefinitely more advancedByA customeron November 1, 1998Format: PaperbackI have spent some time looking at this title, and it covers quite a broad section of Perl applications. The actual language section represents less than 20% of the text, the rest is dedicated to the actual use of the  language - databases, cgi, Win32, system functions. A good book for people  with more advanced applications to write.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent Guide to learn Perl 5ByA customeron February 12, 1999Format: PaperbackThis book is excellent to learn Perl 5, it is better than other titles that I've checked. You only have to read the three first chapters to understand others Perl scripts and even write your own scripts; you can  read them in a week. Perl 5 Unleashed is my personal "Perl  Bible". This book is clear and concise, excellent if you are a  beginner and don't want to spend many hours to learn Perl; also it's an  excellent reference for advanced programmers. It's true that the book has  some typos, but you will get enough knowledge that you will find them  easily, which by the way can be considered as excellent "find-the-bug  excersises". I strongly recommend this book  if you need to learn Perl  right now and from a good teacher. Thank you Husain.Read more0Comment|
