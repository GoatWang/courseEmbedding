October 27, 2009


Oct. 27, 2009
In May 2009, Luther College alumnus Michael Walters, Whitelines director of business development in North America, celebrated the North American launch of Whitelines, a Swedish company providing innovative paper products while remaining dedicated to protecting the environment.
Walters, a 1999 Luther graduate, first encountered Whitelines while working within his company, studio503, where Walters partners with other businesses to direct their overall market strategy, bridging the gap between their products and large retail environments.
While working on a joint venture with Office Depot in 2007, Walters came across a Whitelines booth while attending a convention in Germany. One month later, Walters visited Whitelines in Sweden and established the partnership for business development in North America.
Whitelines, based in Stockholm, Sweden, was founded by three creativity and innovation consultants working with mental tools and training such as Lateral Thinking and TRIZ, a theory of inventive problem solving.
“Although these studies are rare in American universities, Tim Schweizer, Luther professor of management, is an expert in this field,” said Walters. “He was my mentor while attending Luther.”
Using these tools, the founders of Whitelines designed paper products that eliminate the visual conflict between traditional dark lines and writing on a page. By printing white lines on a light gray paper, Whitelines products allow the dark lines of writing and sketches to stand out against the light elements of the page.
This innovation has been shown to help people with learning disabilities, such as autism, dyslexia and eye stigmatism, by removing the eye fatigue, visual stress and distractions that occur when dark ink conflicts with dark lines on a page.
“This is a very important aspect of Whitelines,” said Walters. “Yes, Whitelines is innovative and a healthy option for our planet, but is also serves a very important purpose.” Whitelines is able to serve that purpose while working toward the goal of becoming carbon neutral by producing zero carbon footprint.
In a joint effort with Stockholm’s Royal Institute of Technology and paper producer Stora-Enso, Whitelines’ Nymolla Mill in southern Sweden operates with ultra-modern paper technology that re-uses the carbon dioxide in a closed-loop system, emitting no carbon dioxide from the plant.
Whitelines also focuses on preventing carbon dioxide emissions rather than compensating for them by maintaining short transports to warehouses, shipping large batches overseas by boat and by locally producing and assembling the paper products.
To show their low environmental impact, Whitelines is one of the first companies to place exact individual carbon dioxide footprint labels on all of their products, showing the impact of each product on the environment.
In 2009, Whitelines will start to offset the low, yet remaining carbon dioxide emissions by planting trees in Uganda, a process handled by U&W, a “change to green” consultancy with a 15-year track record.
Walters stated, “ I hope the partnership between Sweden and studio503 can serve as a model for other businesses to not only help our economy by creating new innovations, but finding ways for us all to better our planet.”

Bonhoeffer's Reception of Luther
Michael P. DeJonge



Description



In Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings, Martin Luther is ubiquitous. Too often, however, Bonhoeffer's Lutheranism has been set aside with much less argumentative work than is appropriate in light of his sustained engagement with Luther. As a result, Luther remains a largely untouched hermeneutic key in Bonhoeffer interpretation. In Bonhoeffer's Reception of Luther, Michael P. DeJonge presents Bonhoeffer's Lutheran theology of justification focused on the interpersonal presence of Christ in word, sacrament, and church. The bridge between this theology and Bonhoeffer's ethical-political reflections is his two-kingdoms thinking. Arguing that the widespread failure to connect Bonhoeffer with the Lutheran two-kingdoms tradition has presented a serious obstacle in interpretation, DeJonge shows how this tradition informs Bonhoeffer's reflections on war and peace, as well as his understanding of resistance to political authority. In all of this, DeJonge argues that an appreciation of Luther's ubiquity in Bonhoeffer's corpus sheds light on his thinking, lends it coherence, and makes sense of otherwise difficult interpretive problems. What might otherwise appear as disparate, even contradictory moments or themes in Bonhoeffer's theology can often be read in terms of a consistent commitment to a basic Lutheran theological framework deployed according to dramatically changing circumstances.

Bonhoeffer's Reception of Luther
Michael P. DeJonge


Reviews and Awards


"Students will benefit greatly from DeJonge's investigations of Sanctorum Communio, Act and Being, as well as of The Cost of Discipleship. . .Most exciting is the appreciation of Bonhoeffer's concept of revelation, of the church as Christus praesens in the world here and now. This takes the Catholic doctrine of the church as the body of Christ to new dimensions, as the various works of the German Roman Catholic theologian Ernst Feil (1932-2013) have attested, for example his The Theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1985). DeJonge's recent contribution is a further welcome enrichment of Bonhoeffer literature."--Journal of Religious History
"This work will be essential for anyone interested in the development of Bonhoeffer's theology. Michael DeJonge writes with remarkable clarity about some of the more complex and contested aspects of Bonhoeffer's thought, offering provocative new insights into Bonhoeffer's approach to the two kingdoms, Christian pacifism, and the challenges of resistance. Without ignoring the other theological influences on Bonhoeffer's thought, this book makes a convincing case that to understand Bonhoeffer we must examine his reading and interpretation of Luther."--Victoria J. Barnett, General Editor, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works English Edition
"In this new work, rising star Michael DeJonge executes a lucid, patient and in the end devastating critique of North American readings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's theological legacy. That alone is worth the price of admission. Even better is the extraordinary retrieval he makes of Bonhoeffer's core Lutheranism. DeJonge understands Luther better than many a Lutheran and Bonhoeffer better than any other North American interpreter. Tolle lege."--Paul R. Hinlicky, Tise Professor of Lutheran Studies, Univerzita Komenskeho, Slovakia
"DeJonge's meticulously-researched, contextually-grounded analysis of Bonhoeffer's frequent appropriate of Luther's thought and specific "Lutheran" elements of his application of the biblical message to the mid-twentieth century world combines with the author's critical engagement with scholars who have minimized and misinterpreted Bonhoeffer's deep immersion in the reformer's theology. DeJonge confirms the estimation of Bonhoeffer's own associates who recognized their friend's appreciation of and reliance on Luther's thought in a clearly-stated, convincing argument. This volume offers sharper and deeper insights into Bonhoeffer's ever more relevant assessment of the Christian gospel, the church, and society, and thus it points Bonhoeffer studies in new, exciting directions."--Robert Kolb, Emeritus Professor of Systematic Theology, Concordia Seminary, Saint Louis

When Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-five Theses on the door of the Castle Church in 1517, the hammering in Wittenberg was heard across Europe. As we commemorate this event five hundred years later, the echos are still reverberating throughout Western civilization.

This brief backgrounder explains for Lutherans and non-Lutherans why the Protestant reformation happened, what it meant at the time, and why it still remains relevant today - half a millennium later. The book focuses on the historic roots and context of the Reformations in Germany and England, as well as the key spiritual concepts behind them. 
Over 300 footnotes serve as pointers to original sources, many available online and for free. A kick-starter for your own Reformation research!

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Product Description

 
Meet Martin Luther:
He was the most influential man of his day. The movement that began with his posting of the Ninety-Five Theses reshaped Europe, redirected Christian history, and recovered the truth of God’s Word. Five hundred years later, what is Luther’s legacy? In this volume, R.C. Sproul, Stephen J. Nichols, and thirteen other scholars and pastors examine his life, teaching, and enduring influence. Meet Martin Luther, the mercurial Reformer who, out of love for the truth and the desire to bring it to light, set the world ablaze.

Author

He is the founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries and can be heard teaching daily on the radio program "Renewing Your Mind", which broadcasts on more than three hundred radio outlets in the United States and throughout fifty countries.
 
Endorsement
"This book is a timely reminder that the church of our generation needs to be reformed anew. We desperately need someone like Luther to lift the banner of the gospel high, to shake worldly evangelicals out of their blind spiritual stupor, and to declare war on the devil in Christ's name." - JOHN MACARTHUR, from his foreword
