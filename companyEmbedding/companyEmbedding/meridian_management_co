About Meridian Management
Meridian Management Corporation (MMC) is a locally owned fee-management company that specializes property management services for apartment properties, office buildings, condominiums and homeowners associations, retail centers, and corporate facilities for clients who chose to hire a professional service company to manage their properties.  Meridian is a full service company that performs typical tasks of a management company such as collecting revenues, paying invoices, preparing financial statements and budgets, maintaining properties to the client’s specifications, and is capable of meeting any other needs that the client might have.  We believe that creating strong relationships with our clients and really customizing our services to those needs is the best way to go about this type of business.
MMC utilizes the latest in technologies and this in turn has really changed the way we do business for the better.  In today’s ever changing world of working to make properties more energy efficient and sustainable, Meridian Management is working hard to do its part.  As of today the company is working hard to develop an electronic filing system to help eliminate the amount of paper waste our company produces.  Other ways we are striving to reach these goals is through dealing with vendors who believe in these same “green” principles and strive to do business in a more environmentally friendly way.
Most of Meridians growth can be attributed to referrals from current clients who know how we conduct our business and believe Meridian Management could help another property owner as we have helped them.  We are firm believers in smart growth, and work hard to add a few clients each year.  We believe this is a responsible way of doing business for both our existing clients as well as our future clients.  Meridian was founded on the principles of creating strong relationships with our clients and working to meet their needs.  By growing in a responsible way, this allows us to maintain our high level of customer service and foster those relationships that we have worked hard to create.
Although we are brokers, we do not broker properties, develop new properties or stray from our core business of managing our client’s properties.  We do not have in-house, for profit service departments performing services such as landscaping, roofing, or pool maintenance.  We believe in maintaining truly arms length relationships with vendors who perform those services, who will serve our clients best interest.  This eliminates the possibility of conflicts of interest and promotes the trust needed to maintain the long term relationships with our clients who we value so much.

We manage properties for institutions and owners of businesses who want to concentrate more on their core reason of being in business, and would rather not have to worry about maintaining the facility or facilities that they own and occupy.  In these situations, there may be no rent to collect, but there are still roofs, heating and cooling systems, building facades, and landscapes that need to be maintained.  Our portfolio of these types of properties range from office warehouses to a number of bank branches that are located throughout the state.  In this area of work Meridian has also been asked to manage a wide array of foreclosure and receivership properties for lenders and civil courts.  These range from multifamily properties, shopping centers, office buildings, along with a large number of single family homes.

History
Meridian was founded in 1988 by Tom and Gayle Spencer with its headquarters located in Indianapolis, Indiana.  It has grown to become a well respected service company, primarily serving clients with properties in Indiana and surrounding states.  The company started with just a handful of clients and has had a very steady growth pattern since.  Part of what sets Meridian Management apart is its ability to grow, but do so in a responsible manner.  As a company it has always been important to stick with our principles of creating strong relationships with all of our clients.  This is quite evident as Meridian still has some of its original clients from when the company first started.

Renters Insurance




An important part of apartment living is protecting your property and guarding your personal liability.  If any of your personal property is damaged, destroyed or stolen due to occurrences such as natural disasters, accidents, smoke, vandalism, theft, water damage and more, renter’s insurance will typically cover repair or replacement of your personal property.  If your home is made unlivable by one of these occurrences, renter’s insurance will pay for the associated expenses, such as temporary residence, meals, etc.  Coverage is usually limited to a percentage of the total policy value.  Renter’s insurance gives you the security of knowing that if you lost everything today, you wouldn’t have to start from scratch.
We strongly suggest that you discuss the advantages of renter’s insurance, also known as multi-peril risk insurance coverage, with your insurance agent. Renter’s insurance is relatively inexpensive, and often the insurer offers a discount if you carry both auto and renter’s insurance policies with the same company.
Your lease agreement addresses your responsibility for property loss. Please take the time to read and understand this clause in your lease. We suggest you review and consider this type of coverage for your own protection.

Construction, Project and Program Management
Since 1998 Meridian Management, Inc. (Meridian) has been a leader in Alaska for providing professional project management services, and owner representation is our specialty. We approach projects with an attitude toward teamwork and collaboration, while still looking out for our clients’ best interests and mitigating their risk.
Meridian has a successful performance record for delivering capital projects for private and public entities, in both non-profit and for-profit sectors.  We do not limit our services to any one industry, or minimum project size.  Meridian has managed projects across the state, from Wrangell to Barrow to Dillingham.
Our services include management of capital projects through the entire project life-cycle from design and construction through commissioning and closeout. Depending on the need, we can also manage a specific portion of a project (e.g. solicitation, project controls, etc.). Meridian can also manage clients’ entire capital improvement programs consisting of multiple projects.
What Sets Us Apart?
Meridian is an employee-owned, Alaskan corporation and our staff takes pride in ownership of our work product, and this is reflected by repeat business and referrals from our clients. We work hard to keep our overhead low and maintain competitive rates, which allow our clients to stretch their limited resources.
Our clients appreciate our “hands-on” approach and the experience we bring. Our project managers emphasize communication and resolving issues at the lowest possible level. We stress the importance of on-site quality assurance and bring with us a tool box of experience, certifications and training. Meridian project managers don’t show up to jobsites with shiny new hard hats and boots, unless they just wore them out.






TestimonialOur building committee was comprised of volunteers, so we needed someone who could manage the details and communicate on our behalf on a day to day basis. Meridian was like an extension of the committee. They helped set priorities, select contractors and guide the parish with contracts. They were a real force multiplier; they made smart decisions and saved us money.Bill Kontess, A.I.A., Building Committee Chair for St. Andrews Parish
TestimonialWe’ve been working with Meridian as a part of our team for eight years. They’ve provided a considerable amount of excellent professional engineering support to the team. Meridian is a great company and an excellent firm to work with.” John Faunce, PB Americas Principal Project Manager, Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport

"Bridging the gap between ideas and reality"


Founded in 1998, Meridian Management, LLC is a unique design firm specializing in innovative solutions for the telecom and wireless industries. The firm is the realization of a vision to bring together design expertise with an in-depth understanding of wireless development in order to provide state-of-the-art design solutions to our clients.
We offer a wealth of experience in all disciplines required to develop telecommunications, tower, wireless, small cell, joint pole, and DAS sites. We have pioneered innovative methods for the entire design process, enabling our clients to streamline municipal permitting and go on-air in a reduced timeframe. We invite you to learn more about who we are and how we can help you.



"These guys are the best. They're a pleasure to work with and they do great work."

About Us


The Beginning


Meridian Management, LLC began as a specialized consulting firm providing high-end 3D, animation, and technical CAD services to the architectural community in the SF Bay Area. In 1997, the firm was contracted by Nextel to design a number of raw land telecom sites, due in large part to the extensive experience with zoning, site development, visualization, and planning work. With a background in site development, the firm began to specialize in telecom work and quickly became a leader in the field. In 1999, Rodney Barnes, a telecommunications professional with years of technical experience, joined the firm. The foundation of a strong architectural/telecommunications base was complete. This 'union' of talent is the strength of our service and the reason why we have enjoyed steady growth, success, and repeat business throughout the firm's history



"There isn't an A/E firm that I've come to rely on more than Meridian Management LLC. Their collective experience and knowledge are invaluable to us."
AAV Construction
					Manager
					T-Mobile USA


Our Approach


At Meridian Management, LLC, we are keenly aware of the rapidly changing telecom environment. Advanced networking systems including the development of 4G, LTE, DAS, and joint pole installations requires the design professional to adapt in ways like never before. We understand these challenges and are continually striving to develop faster, cheaper, and more efficient ways of designing wireless facilities. Among these services include specializing in turn-key solutions for joint pole facilities, sustainable LEED-based designs for raw land sites, streamlining the LTE equipment upgrade process, and pioneering a web-based site auditing process.
We also understand the competitive nature of the wireless industry and the scheduling and budget constraints inherent in this type of work. In response to these demands, Meridian Management, LLC employs a deliberate and controlled approach to the development of each project. On the premise that each project requires a blend of professional expertise, we employ a collaborative approach to a project's development from initial site visit through construction documentation. The firm's principals are actively involved on each project, thus assuring the highest level of service, availability, and responsiveness each site deserves.



Our Mission

We are firm believers in designing telecom facilities to seamlessly integrate into their existing setting. We also understand the need to conceal this equipment to the best of our abilities. We continuously promote an in-depth understanding of the site in an effort to develop design strategies that are efficient, practical, and compatible with both the environment, existing conditions, owner expectations, and the general public.
Our mission is simple:

To never be satisfied
To always strive to be better and more efficient
To achieve customer satisfaction and profitability
To be pioneers, to redefine boundaries, to take risks
To be the best!




Key Staff


Jan M. Goldfluss, President, brings to the company over 31 years of professional experience in site development, telecommunications facilities, landscape architecture, project management, computer applications, planning, and construction management. As company founder, Jan has been responsible for designing and managing over 1,500 telecommunications sites for clients throughout the US. As a central player in the firm's growth and development, Jan serves as Director of Design and Production, where he plans, manages, tracks, and provides quality control for all the firm's project work.  He also serves as the Director for New Business Development.  In this role, his high-level guidance impacts long range planning, marketing efforts, new products development, and all other aspects of client services. He is also active in the creation of the firm's innovative products and services including DAS systems and pole top sites.



Rodney Barnes, Vice President, has over 22 years in telecom and helps focus on the process and not merely the results. His extensive experience working with a wide range of telecommunications carriers and third-party vendors provided the technical foundation that contributed to the firm's growth and success. His involvement in telecommunications goes back to Nextel in 1994 where he was one of the first individuals to work in all three site development disciplines - leasing, zoning and construction. Clients continually tap into his vast knowledge of the entire build process to expedite approvals, constructability issues and cost savings. Rodney has developed a complete understanding of the implementation of ROW usage. He has extensive knowledge of JPA and GO95 requirements. Rodney serves as Vice President and Director of Client Relations and Operations.









Services


Telecom Design


The design of telecommunications sites involves a whole range of capabilities and experience. At Meridian Management LLC, we employ a comprehensive approach to the design of cell sites including a full range of engineering services, constructability analysis, site and landscape design, surveying, and visual simulation. Our strength is in our understanding of site constraints and exactly what is required to obtain building permits and allow bidding and construction to proceed. With this in mind, Meridian Management LLC's technical and architecture professionals design custom site solutions for a broad array of telecommunications facilities. From hillsides to rooftops, co-locatable poles to faux trees, steeples to architectural additions, and water tanks to billboards, the professionals at Meridian Management LLC will work with you to provide the most practical, cost-effective, and approvable design possible.

Joint Pole Design


Telecom providers understand the benefits of buying the necessary space to construct their systems on existing utility poles rather than having to construct new poles or lease space from utility companies. This has reduced carrier infrastructural costs, distributed maintenance costs among utilities, and facilitated the deployment of new technology, all to the benefit of the consumer. It also enables carriers to penetrate coverage areas once deemed inaccessible due to zoning, physical limitations, or other impediments.
We understand the complex nature of siting antennas and cabinets on existing poles with existing power and communications equipment. We are experts in navigating the GO95 requirements to insure compatibility of services while providing safety to maintenance and construction workers.
Whether you need to select suitable pole candidates, custom design pole equipment, coordination with utility companies, analysis of pole integrity, gain municipal approvals, prepare design drawings, or prepare guidelines for entire joint pole networks, Meridian Management LLC are the experts to assist you.

DAS Systems


With the growing demand for broadband services, wireless carriers across the U.S. are finding that their existing networks sometimes are inadequate. They are turning to Distributed Antenna System (DAS) networks as an attractive option where macro cell sites cover too many users, zoning ordinances restrict locating antennas on towers or rooftops, or there is a need to offload macro-cellular traffic to alleviate data traffic congestion.
At Meridian Management LLC, we work with carriers in the planning, designing, and permitting of DAS networks to optimize network operations while minimizing the infrastructural footprint.
We offer our clients a cost-effective and efficient approach to the design of node and hub facilities, including:

Site Auditing
Lease Exhibits

Site Auditing


Audits, both file and site, are an important part of the wireless industry today and for the foreseeable future. Audits are performed for a variety of reasons but generally for license applications, inventory requirements, and database creation and verification. 
Understanding the importance of site audits, the professionals at Meridian Management LLC in 2008 founded a subsidiary firm Audigent to offer state-of-the art web-based applications to complete audits more effectively and efficiently.
 





Advantages


Reduces time needed to complete and finalize audits Standardizes data collection 
Fully functional help menus and support call-in facilitates on-site accuracy
Completely customizable auditing templates
Web-based audit forms can be accessed from virtually anywhere
Intelligent database provides relevant information for technical, financial, and marketing purposes

Experience




As industry leaders, we specialize in providing comprehensive architectural and engineering services for our telecommunication clients. With over 1,500 successfully completed installations, the professionals at Meridian Management LLC have built a solid reputation for exceeding expectations in design, budget controls, and constructability.
We empower our staff to think freely, to be creative, to always explore more efficient and cost-effective solutions, in an effort to provide the highest quality of service. This explains why we are often called upon to handle the most difficult and challenging sites. We specialize in custom telecom sites of all types, with particular emphasis on complex installations, unapprovable locations, difficult schedules, and innovative technologies.

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream.

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants.

How can I find the right property management company for me?
You can take the first step toward finding the right property management company by using All Property Management's search feature to locate the property managers in your area who manage single family homes. We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

What should I look for in a professional HOA manager?
The most effective attributes a successful HOA Property Management Company can have are: 1.) the ability to handle day-to-day issues without supervision 2.) guide the Board's decision-making processes and 3.) be responsive to homeowners. 
Naturally, a successful HOA manager should be professionally compentent in all aspects of Association Management and have the requisite certifications and track record to perform their required duties. But there are other attributes that are important to be a successful HOA service provider.
Homeowners have more permanence than renters, so effective HOA Management must consider the long-term implications of its actions differently than a typical property management firm. Consistency, longevity and proven experience are important considerations, as are the interpersonal skills of the firm's managers in dealing with conflicts, emergencies and the expressed interests of the Board in improving their community.
With this in mind, it's important to hire an HOA management company that has proven methods for managing group politics and negotiating agreements among members with conflicting points of view. As you interview potential HOA managers, be sure to focus a significant portion of your discussions on understanding each manager's typical communication methods and tactics for conflict resolution.

How can I find an HOA management company?

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions. 

How can I easily find a property manager?
At All Property Management, we make it easy to find the right apartment complex manager for your rental property, whether you’re looking for someone to manage a few apartments and townhomes, a large apartment complex, commercial property – or a portfolio that includes all these and more. Just select the property type and fill in your rental’s zip code to generate an instant list of apartment building managers in your area. For best results, we recommend interviewing at least two or three companies to find the one that is best suited for your needs.
