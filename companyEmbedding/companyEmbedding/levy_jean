501® ORIGINAL
Started by us. Finished by you.

                        In 1873, workers who’d flocked to the American West in search of fortune needed pants that could work and endure, so Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis combined quality denim and rivet reinforcements, creating the first pair of blue jeans: the Levi’s® 501® Original.

                        Created before the invention of the zipper, the signature button fly is a key detail which defines the 501® Jean,the perfect union of function and style.

                        The iconic Two Horse patch stitched on to the back of every pair of 501® Jeans illustrates the original promise made by Levi Strauss: “It’s no use, they can’t be ripped” and celebrates the strength and quality of the riveted denim.
                    











                        “It started out being purely functional. And became a style leader.”

                        "We're acutely aware of people customizing their jeans—making them a little bit tapered, taking a lot out of the leg and then vacuum-packing themselves into vintage Levi's®. That was really the beginning of the 501® Skinny."
                    
– JONATHAN CHEUNG, SVP DESIGN






























                    "Leaner and meaner than ever before."

                    “After hemming, tapering the leg of the 501® jeans is the most requested alteration in Levi’s® stores and tailor shops around the world, so we decided to do it for you, creating the 501® Taper and the perfect custom taper.”

                        Most denim comes pre-shrunk, but our Shrink-to-Fit™ Jeans do just what it says on the tag.
                        Made from authentic raw denim that forms to your body. The fit, wear and finish are all unique to you.

 HANG ‘EM OUT TO DRY -
 OR JUST BUY AND WEAR-
 GET THE PERFECT FIT
                    

                        Moisture shrinks jeans more in the legs than the waist. Wear them before you wash them and always air-dry them, so they shrink everywhere you need them to, and nowhere you don’t.

Levi Jeans for Guys at JCPenney
The inventor of blue jeans has the market cornered, and when it comes to Levi jeans for guys, JCPenney has every style, every cut, every color and every option for every man. Like you, Levi Strauss & Co is driven by hard work, creativity and strong values. When you zip on a pair of Levis, you feel the work and innovation that went into the making of comfort and style.

Guys Levis by the Number
The best way to find the best fit for you is by checking out the number. Levi uses a classic three-digit numbering system to organize fits, cuts and styles so you know at a glance exactly how that pair will fit you. For guys, the number is pretty straightforward and accounts for the overall fit—waist rise, leg opening and seat fit. For the most classic, straight leg style, try out the 501 Original, complete with a slim fit and the original button fly. From the original 501’s to the loose fitting 569’s, you’ll find a style of guys Levi’s that you’ll love enough to buy over and over again. More likely, you’ll find that many different styles give you the fit and look you want. So get them, the 501’s and the 517’s. Get more than one of every style, because when you’re shopping at JCPenney, you know you don’t have to wait for a sale. You can get great deals on Levi jeans for guys every day.

In addition to the many styles and cuts of guys Levi’s we have, JCPenney also offers a full line of guys Levi clothing, including twill pants, denim and cargo shorts, shrink-to-fit jeans and denim and faux-leather jackets. Whether you’re completing your wardrobe or completely starting over, Levi has got your number. Come get yours at our men’s clothing collection.

Give Into the Timeless Comfort and Style of Women's Levi Jeans
Women's Levi's are iconic—full-stop, point-blank, end of sentence. Take advantage of the brand's reputation and explore the wide world of Levi's clothing for women. You'll find jeans that fit every imaginable shape, size, and taste level, but the fashion doesn't stop there—uncover a selection of tops, skirts, shorts, and jackets, as well.
Jeans for Days
It doesn't matter what style of jeans you like best; you'll find them here. Skinny jeans are still going strong in the world of trending fashion. Stonewashed, white, black, distressed—pick your poison. Relaxed fit and boot cut jeans abound. Cool off in denim shorts in various lengths or capris that give off a carefree, preppy vibe. Denim leggings are even more fitted than skinny jeans, but it's easier to move around in them, so you get the best of both worlds. Clearly, you're spoiled for choices. You've got denim for days.
Every Type of Top
You might not realize the stunning selection of tops that Levi's has to offer. T-shirts emblazoned with pleasing on-brand designs are ideal for casual days. Wear them to the gym, or let them do double duty as pajama tops. Cozy flannels in vivid plaid palettes embrace the grunge look that's coming back with such a comfortable vengeance. Why not layer them with a Levi's tee? You can even find fashion tops, such as off-the-shoulder pieces with a distinct Boho chic vibe.
A Little Extra
Denim is a versatile material. It's also timeless, so it's no surprise that Levi's has a variety of other denim items. Why not up your fashion game and step out wearing a denim vest? Pins and patches are optional. Take your love for retro fashion to a new, higher level. Remember when you used to wear your denim jacket everywhere? Pick up the habit again. All you have to do is pick out a modern version of your vintage favorite.
Jean skirts are having a huge trending moment, as well. You might want to stick with black, but you'll wear it more often than you think. You can't go wrong with denim shorts, either. From Bermuda shorts to thigh-skimming options, you'll find a style you love.
Browse jeans, jackets, tops, and more to satisfy your cravings for denim. Check out JCPenney's collection of women's Levi's clothing and indulge yourself.

sustainabilityproducts



We view fashion as a merging of art, innovation and sustainability. After all, Levi’s® jeans are what the next generation wears — and we take that role to heart. We like to say that our company and our products are Made of Progress, in part because we have a long history of firsts. Of leading. Of innovating. Of making a difference.
Innovation is embedded throughout our clothing, from our rivet patent in 1873 to the more recent development of the Water<Less™, Waste<Less™ and Wellthread collections.
Water‹Less™Water‹Less™
Our lifecycle studies illustrate how essential water is to our business. We’re extremely dependent on it: every step of the process to create a garment requires water, from the cotton fields to manufacturing facilities.
In an era of increasing water scarcity, we recognize that water is an essential raw material for agriculture and many industries besides apparel. We must decouple the growth of our business and our water needs if we want to continue leading into the future.
The Water<Less™ process approaches the decisions made in the design process in a different way, reducing the amount of water used in the finishing process. It’s not rocket science, but it is innovative. For instance, by simply removing water from stone washes or combining multiple wet cycle processes, we can significantly reduce water usage — up to 96 percent for some styles. At the same time, we still deliver the same great look and feel that you know and love.
Since launching the Water<Less™ process in 2011, we have saved more than 1 billion liters of water in the manufacturing of LS&Co. products, including 30 million liters of fresh water saved through reuse and recycling. By 2020, the Levi’s brand aims to make 80 percent of its products using Water<Less™ techniques, up from nearly 25 percent today.

SHOP WATER<LESS™Levi’s® Wellthread™ CollectionRecognizing that true innovation is best achieved by rethinking the entire apparel making process, we are breaking down the silos of design, sourcing and production to develop more sustainable practices. Our collaborative approach to sustainable design has produced a number of important breakthroughs for our enduring brands.
Our latest Levi’s® Wellthread™ Collection represents a fundamental reinvention of the design process to incorporate sustainability into every stage of the development process. The end results are durable products with timeless, enduring style that are more responsible for both the people who wear them and the planet.
The Levi’s® Wellthread™ Collection is the first ever to feature Levi’s® Water<Less™ fabric, which saves more than 65 percent of the water in the dye process than conventional dyeing. For this collection, Water<Less™ finishes use up to 50 percent less water than traditional finishing.
Also integral to the Wellthread approach is the creation of products from a single fiber-cotton. Made of 100% cotton, the fabric, thread, pocketing, and labels are all designed for recyclability, with a future state of closed loop recycling in mind.
The collection is produced in factories where we’re implementing a new approach to improving the lives of apparel workers. From Haiti to Sri Lanka, Levi’s® Wellthread™ garments were made at facilities that invest in the well-being of the people who crafted the garments. Examples include programs that help promote financial literacy and women’s health and family wellness.
SHOP THE LEVI'S® WELLTHREAD™ COLLECTIONWaste‹Less™Levi’s® Waste‹Less™ Collection
Water is just one example of the resource constraints we are facing across the planet. Looking into the future, there’s no guarantee that there will enough land available to meet global demand for cotton, the main input for our apparel.
So to be a successful company in a world that is increasingly resource-constrained, we need to continue down the road toward achieving closed-loop apparel — while incorporating other alternatives to virgin raw materials.
This is why we launched the Levi’s® Waste<Less™ collection of products that are made of 20 percent post-consumer waste- specifically, recycled plastic bottles. That works out to an average of three to eight plastic bottles per pair.

To date (since the collection launched in Spring 2013), we’ve used 11.9 million recycled bottles for products such as Levi’s® 511™ Skinny jeans, Levi’s® Trucker jackets and the women’s Levi’s® Boyfriend Skinny jeans.

White is a bit thin
June 27, 2017

Stephanie

from 



Age: 
25-29


Gender: 
Female



I got these in white and found them to be a bit thin and see thru (I could see the pockets through the pants). Returned them. Otherwise, they fit fine. I just wouldn't recommend the white color.
Yes, I recommend this product.

Exactly what I was looking for
June 17, 2017

Sofia

from 



Age: 



Gender: 




I am 5.6 and 126 lbs and I ordered a size 26 regular. It was exactly what I was looking for, very tight along the whole leg. And it had a perfect length to be worn with high heels. Other Levi's jeans in the same length tend to be a little too long and to accumulate in the ankle area. Overall I am very happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend.
Yes, I recommend this product.

Perfect Fit
May 26, 2017

Nikke344

from 



Age: 



Gender: 




Bought these in a size 31 waist and 28 length...perfect fit. I'm somewhat curvy and I normally have to get them taken in at the waist but these are made just for my body type. They are soft, stretchy, and comfortable and the fact they come in different lengths made them even better. I'm 5'4 and the 28 inseam was great.
Yes, I recommend this product.

Very nice jeans. I always wear Levi's jeans but this one is lil different denim. I initially ordered 33x32 but that didn't fit. So, I ordered a new one 34x32 which came in only 3 days. Macy's customer service is excellent as it took less than 2 minutes to return the jeans which didn't fit.

The 511's are some of the best fitting Levi's on the market. They sit comfortablely at the waist slim throuh the leg with a good amount of stretch. I would give this 5 stars but the last pair I bought in the light washed denium the legs were a little looser than usual. Still would buy more 511's

    About Levi’s® Products    Craftsmanship Clothing made finer,      stronger, better  Learn how we craft     clothing to fit     your life    Innovation Uniforms of progress  Learn how we’re     innovating for the     next generation    Sustainability Made with purpose  Learn how we’re     Creating products that benefit     people and the planet      OUR STORY IS BEHIND EVERY SEAM Strength. That’s the meaning behind our iconic Two Horses logo — and it still resonates today, more than a century since it was first branded into a leather patch of 501® jeans in 1886. When Levi Strauss co-invented the blue jean in 1873, he didn’t know that he was creating a global brand that would become known for self-expression and classic American cool. And that’s the beauty of the Levi’s® story.    Craftsmanship Levi’s® clothing is crafted for life. Unrivalled construction. Tried and tested. American originals. No matter how you say it, every piece of Levi’s® clothing embodies a sense of craft and quality — from the classic fit of Levi’s® 501® jeans to the refined details of Levi’s® Made & Crafted collection. For us, craftsmanship translates to design with purpose. From fabric to stitching, here’s just a slice of how Levi’s® products are crafted with care.  Levi’s® clothing starts with quality components EVERY PAIR OF LEVI’s® IS MADE WITH THE BEST FABRIC FOR FIT: NATURAL COTTON. Because we’re committed to doing good for people and the earth, we support sustainably grown cotton and the Better Cotton Initiative to improve the cotton production process. CLICK TO READ MORE ABOUT OUR WORK WITH THE BETTER COTTON INITIATIVE GETTING THE COLOR JUST RIGHT From deep blues to faded indigos, for us, denim is equal parts fashion, art and function. The colors you choose are an expression of who you are. That’s why we offer a range of colors to suit all your wearing occasions. LEVI’s® RIVETS: MADE STRONG ENOUGH FOR AMERICAN COWBOYS AND MINERS. The Levi’s® rivet has become a standard in quality design around the world — and it all started with two American entrepreneurs joining forces during the Gold Rush era. As the owner of a San Francisco general-goods store in 1872, Levi Strauss supplied denim to Jacob Davis, a tailor who had created copper rivets to fasten pockets to pants. With the goal of making workpants as strong as possible, Jacobs’ invention was so good that he couldn’t keep up with demand. Enter Strauss, who pioneered product development and manufacturing of the original Levi’s® blue jeans.     DETAILS MAKE THE DESIGN  We’re a bit obsessed with selvedge. Selvedge or selvage (meaning “self-edge”) — the natural edge of a roll of denim fabric — is part of our DNA. As an ode to the original Levi’s® signature red-stitched selvedge, we created Levi’s® Selvedge, a collection known for its heavyweight, raw denim and khaki and red stitching on its inside seam. Woven on traditional shuttle looms that operate at a slow speed, the time-consuming process of making selvedge denim ranks it the highest quality in the world.  Learn more about selvedge WATCH THE VIDEO Denim and the machine: Our looms keep up with global demand. Rooting back to the 1870s, denim was produced on 29” looms, which operated at a relatively slow speed. Due to increased demand for denim, in the 1950s, Levi Strauss & Co. replaced the old shuttle-style looms with modern projectile looms. The new looms produce wider fabric at a faster speed. We take every stitch seriously. Whether you favor the single-needle stitching found in Skinny Men’s Jeans, double-needle stitching in Levi’s® Vintage 501XX® 1947 Big E Redline Selvage “Rodeo Hero” Jeans or the double felled inseam characteristic of Levi’s® 606 (Janis Joplin’s favorite), we take pride in paying attention to the details. You make our classics classic. We’re honored that denim aficionados pay thousands of dollars for vintage Levi’s® jeans. But we also want to make the vintage looks you love more accessible. Enter the Levi’s® Classics Upgrade collection, which resurrects the craftsmanship, durability and simplicity of vintage styles. Made with slightly heavier-weight denim dyed with a deeper indigo and high-quality reinforcements in areas like back pockets, Levi’s® Classics Upgrades are the same as ever — but like never before.    Innovation Wear the uniform of progress A wise person once said that the best way to have a good idea is to have lots of them. Luckily, we have no shortage of ideas — and they’re largely inspired by you. From our rivet patent in 1873 to the Levi’s® Commuter series antimicrobial protective fabric to environmental advances of the Water<LESS™ collection, every Levi’s® innovation starts when we ask ourselves, “What can we do better?” As an international team who wears our own designs, we view fashion as a merger of art, innovation and sustainability. After all, Levi’s® jeans are what the next generation wears — and we take that role to heart. Here are a few examples of how we’re constantly reimagining the Levi’s® brand…  Water<LESS™ — Start small, think big. In 2011, we launched Levi’s® Water<LESS™, a collection produced with significantly less water. Instead of using water during the stonewash process, we use a dry-stone process that produces similar results in more than a dozen classic Levi’s® jeans, including 501® jeans, 511TM jeans and the Levi’s® Trucker Jacket. We’ve already saved over 170 million liters of water with Water<LESS™. And this is just the beginning — we’re committed to doing right by the planet in as many ways possible.  Want to help save water? Watch this video. WATCH THIS VIDEO    Sta-Prest — Permanent. Sharp. Crease. In 1964, Levi Strauss & Co. patented the Sta-Prest process at our plant in Knoxville, Tennessee — giving a permanent, sharp front crease to fine trousers and shirts. Engineered with a resin-coated twill/polyester blend to prevent wrinkling, Sta-Prest was reintroduced in spring 2012.  Levi’s® Commuter — Form. Function. Cycling. Masterminded for cyclists and people with active lifestyles, the Levi’s® Commuter series is designed to stay stronger longer, with reinforced fabric that wicks sweat and repels water and dirt. Constructed with protective features — including a U-lock storage waistband, reflective tape for nighttime visibility and antimicrobial technology — these jeans, shirts and jackets are the epitome of functionality with uncompromised style.     MADE OF PROGRESS Our global commitment to responsible craftsmanship We believe that meaningful progress is about getting better at creating less impact on the planet and supporting programs designed to benefit the greater good. And that’s why we’re proactive about developing sustainable products and business practices. From the integration of our factories in the 1940s to our outspoken advocacy for equality and civil rights, we’ve always been agents of progress. Since the early 1990s, through efforts like establishing one of the first Restricted Substance Lists (RSL), that set a standard for chemical management, to most recently making jeans from Better cotton, we’ve taken a leadership role in attempting to minimize the adverse environmental impacts of our business.We can’t do this work without you. Together we can make a difference. Here’s how we’re making progress, and we invite you to join us…  LESS IMPACT > < GREATER GOOD AS OBSESSED AS WE ARE WITH DESIGN DETAILS, WE ALSO TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO MAKING LEVI’S® CLOTHING; FROM CONCEPTION TO THE RETIREMENT OF JEANS AND DEFINING OUR TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT TO PROVIDE A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT. DOING RIGHT SUSTAINABLY To design with awareness of the greater impact is an ethos that continues to drive our progress in creating less impact on the planet and our achieve mission to help restore the environment.We’re proud to have created one of the first set of requirements for suppliers that include water quality and chemicals used in our products.Because 95 percent of Levi’s® products are made of cotton, the first stage in making our products sustainable, throughout the Levi’s® Lifecycle of a Jean, is assuring best practices for farmers growing cotton. We collaborate with the Better Cotton Initiative, a non-profit that aims to make global cotton production better for the environment and the 300 million people who grow cotton. In 2012, we created 20 million pairs of Levi’s® and Denizen™ jeans made with a blend of Better Cotton.Through participation in the Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (BICEP), we’ve joined other global companies in calling for leadership and support from U.S. Congress to develop energy and climate legislation that promotes energy efficiency and reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions. <Read more about how we’re saving energy here.> The Water<Less™ Challenge — Less is more In 2011, we launched Levi’s® Water<Less™, a collection produced  using less water during finishing. Levi’s denim finishing experts innovated new techniques with an eye to reduce water consumption while achieving the same great style and look that our customers expect.  For example, instead of using water during the stonewash process, Water<Less™ products use a dry-stone process that produces similar results in more than a dozen classic Levi’s® jeans, including 501® jeans, 511™ jeans and the Levi’s® Trucker Jacket. In 2012 we produced 29 million Water<Less™ products saving over 360 million liters of water. And this is just the beginning — we’re committed to doing right by the planet in as many ways possible. <Click here to learn how you can help us stay heavy on style, lighter on water.> In 2012, we partnered with Water.org to ask a simple question: If you could give someone clean water for life, would you? Thousands of people in more than 1,300 cities around the world rose to the Go Water<Less™ Challenge. As a result, we helped provide clean drinking water for life to 4,110 people around the world. But, with nearly one billion people on our planet lacking access to clean drinking water, the crisis is far from over. Making a difference is easier than you think.  Here’s how you can help:  Standing up for workers’ rights In 1991, Levi’s® implemented its <Terms of Engagement>to help improve the lives of apparel workers in factories around the world. As the first apparel company to set standards for suppliers globally, Levi’s® terms have become known as the code that launched a thousand codes, remaking the way the apparel industry is run. On the 20th anniversary of our first TOE, we recently recommitted to not only enforce our current requirements for factories but to take our programs one step further through pilot programs that seek to improve the lives of workers outside the factory walls.We also created the  Social and Environmental Sustainability Guidebookto benefit members of the Levi’s® family. The guidebook covers topics ranging from safety guidelines for garment makers to Freedom of Association. Engaged with the community In the spirit of our founder Levi Strauss, our employees have been giving back to our communities for more than 150 years — by mobilizing volunteer teams that work year round to support charitable organizations, by rushing to help when disaster strikes and by supporting special events to raise awareness and funding for important causes. <Learn more about our community and volunteer efforts.>>   WE SET THE BAR HIGH WITH OUR MATERIALS Global bottled water consumption is over 29 liters per person, per year. Unfortunately, many of these bottles are not recycled – in the US, only 29% of PET bottles are recycled; in Europe, only 48%; and in Japan, 72%. Garbage is piling up. These disposable bottles are not going to just disappear.Municipal recycling programs use new technology to recover plastic bottles and food trays across the U.S. They are cleaned, sorted, crushed and made into a polyester fiber, which is then blended with cotton and woven into the denim of Waste<Less™ jeans and Trucker jackets.Recycled brown, green, blue and clear plastic bottles, as well as black food trays have become a new resource efficient material that also provides a unique color and finish. The lightweight, non-stretch White Oak Cone denim, found in our 2013 collection, is also remarkably soft and flexible.By incorporating post-consumer waste into our Waste<Less™ denim we use less virgin cotton and virgin polyester and, in turn, less natural resources. In the spring of 2013, we’ll recycle approximately 3.5 million PET plastic bottles, and that’s just the start. In seasons to come, look for more impact-reducing Waste<Less™ apparel. BETTER COTTON Cotton accounts for 40% of the world’s fiber production and generates a $40 billion a year textile market. Though we are a big consumer of cotton, we use less than 1% of the world’s annual cotton crop. But regardless of the size of our cotton consumption, we're committed to promoting more sustainable practices and have done so by joining forces with other brands and retailers to form the Better Cotton Initiative. Click here to learn more ADDITIONAL FIBERS Within our product offering, we also use organic cotton, which requires no pesticides to grow, and Tencel®, a natural fiber made from wood pulp that takes less energy to produce. RECYCLED PACKAGING CONTENT Because we want to use recycled materials as much as possible, in 2009, we introduced clothing made with post-consumer fiber. In 2010, we committed to a Sustainable Forest Product Procurement Policy, which states that we promote sustainable forestry practices, and we will not knowingly purchase wood and paper products from endangered forests and other highly controversial sources such as high-risk regions for illegal logging. We created a Care Tag for our Planet Did you know that you can reduce the full lifecycle climate change impact of your jeans by up to 50 percent by line drying and washing them in cold water? We were surprised, too.In 2010, we created the Care Tag for our Planet initiative with this simple message: Machine wash cold, line dry when possible, donate to Goodwill.Donating your used Levi’s® jeans to Goodwill helps reduce the approximately 23.8 billion pounds of clothing and textiles that go into U.S. landfills each year, said Jim Gibbons, president and CEO of Goodwill Industries International. Check out these clever ways to air-dry clothing, from our Care to Air Contest.

501® ORIGINAL
Started by us. Finished by you.

                        In 1873, workers who’d flocked to the American West in search of fortune needed pants that could work and endure, so Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis combined quality denim and rivet reinforcements, creating the first pair of blue jeans: the Levi’s® 501® Original.
                    
Shop Men
Shop Women










                        Created before the invention of the zipper, the signature button fly is a key detail which defines the 501® Jean,the perfect union of function and style.

                        The iconic Two Horse patch stitched on to the back of every pair of 501® Jeans illustrates the original promise made by Levi Strauss: “It’s no use, they can’t be ripped” and celebrates the strength and quality of the riveted denim.
                    











                        “It started out being purely functional. And became a style leader.”

                        "We're acutely aware of people customizing their jeans—making them a little bit tapered, taking a lot out of the leg and then vacuum-packing themselves into vintage Levi's®. That was really the beginning of the 501® Skinny."
                    
– JONATHAN CHEUNG, SVP DESIGN

                        Introduced to the world in 2015, the 501® Taper retains all the key elements of the 501® Original, now reimagined with a slightly more tailored look.
                    









                    “After hemming, tapering the leg of the 501® jeans is the most requested alteration in Levi’s® stores and tailor shops around the world, so we decided to do it for you, creating the 501® Taper and the perfect custom taper.”

501® SHRINK-TO-FIT™
Raw Denim Perfection

                        Most denim comes pre-shrunk, but our Shrink-to-Fit™ Jeans do just what it says on the tag.
                        Made from authentic raw denim that forms to your body. The fit, wear and finish are all unique to you.
                    












                        DIP ‘EM IN THE TUB-
 HANG ‘EM OUT TO DRY -
 OR JUST BUY AND WEAR-
 GET THE PERFECT FIT
                    

                        Moisture shrinks jeans more in the legs than the waist. Wear them before you wash them and always air-dry them, so they shrink everywhere you need them to, and nowhere you don’t.

Levi Jeans for Guys at JCPenney
The inventor of blue jeans has the market cornered, and when it comes to Levi jeans for guys, JCPenney has every style, every cut, every color and every option for every man. Like you, Levi Strauss & Co is driven by hard work, creativity and strong values. When you zip on a pair of Levis, you feel the work and innovation that went into the making of comfort and style.

Guys Levis by the Number
The best way to find the best fit for you is by checking out the number. Levi uses a classic three-digit numbering system to organize fits, cuts and styles so you know at a glance exactly how that pair will fit you. For guys, the number is pretty straightforward and accounts for the overall fit—waist rise, leg opening and seat fit. For the most classic, straight leg style, try out the 501 Original, complete with a slim fit and the original button fly. From the original 501’s to the loose fitting 569’s, you’ll find a style of guys Levi’s that you’ll love enough to buy over and over again. More likely, you’ll find that many different styles give you the fit and look you want. So get them, the 501’s and the 517’s. Get more than one of every style, because when you’re shopping at JCPenney, you know you don’t have to wait for a sale. You can get great deals on Levi jeans for guys every day.

In addition to the many styles and cuts of guys Levi’s we have, JCPenney also offers a full line of guys Levi clothing, including twill pants, denim and cargo shorts, shrink-to-fit jeans and denim and faux-leather jackets. Whether you’re completing your wardrobe or completely starting over, Levi has got your number. Come get yours at our men’s clothing collection.

Give Into the Timeless Comfort and Style of Women's Levi Jeans
Women's Levi's are iconic—full-stop, point-blank, end of sentence. Take advantage of the brand's reputation and explore the wide world of Levi's clothing for women. You'll find jeans that fit every imaginable shape, size, and taste level, but the fashion doesn't stop there—uncover a selection of tops, skirts, shorts, and jackets, as well.
Jeans for Days
It doesn't matter what style of jeans you like best; you'll find them here. Skinny jeans are still going strong in the world of trending fashion. Stonewashed, white, black, distressed—pick your poison. Relaxed fit and boot cut jeans abound. Cool off in denim shorts in various lengths or capris that give off a carefree, preppy vibe. Denim leggings are even more fitted than skinny jeans, but it's easier to move around in them, so you get the best of both worlds. Clearly, you're spoiled for choices. You've got denim for days.
Every Type of Top
You might not realize the stunning selection of tops that Levi's has to offer. T-shirts emblazoned with pleasing on-brand designs are ideal for casual days. Wear them to the gym, or let them do double duty as pajama tops. Cozy flannels in vivid plaid palettes embrace the grunge look that's coming back with such a comfortable vengeance. Why not layer them with a Levi's tee? You can even find fashion tops, such as off-the-shoulder pieces with a distinct Boho chic vibe.
A Little Extra
Denim is a versatile material. It's also timeless, so it's no surprise that Levi's has a variety of other denim items. Why not up your fashion game and step out wearing a denim vest? Pins and patches are optional. Take your love for retro fashion to a new, higher level. Remember when you used to wear your denim jacket everywhere? Pick up the habit again. All you have to do is pick out a modern version of your vintage favorite.
Jean skirts are having a huge trending moment, as well. You might want to stick with black, but you'll wear it more often than you think. You can't go wrong with denim shorts, either. From Bermuda shorts to thigh-skimming options, you'll find a style you love.
Browse jeans, jackets, tops, and more to satisfy your cravings for denim. Check out JCPenney's collection of women's Levi's clothing and indulge yourself.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
