 Company Overview









Lumber Liquidators was founded in 1994 when Tom Sullivan began selling surplus building materials at heavily discounted prices. Two years later, the Company identified an opportunity to sell hardwood flooring at “liquidator” prices after observing that traditional home improvement and flooring retailers underserved customers in terms of price, selection, quality, availability and service. Lumber Liquidators began working directly with mills to provide customers with a broad assortment of high-quality products at a lower cost than its competitors.
Lumber Liquidators is now the largest specialty retailer of hardwood flooring in North America. The Company has achieved a reputation for offering great value, superior service and a broad selection of high-quality hardwood flooring products.  Lumber Liquidators offers an extensive assortment of exotic and domestic hardwood species, engineered hardwoods, laminates, bamboo and cork at low prices designed to appeal to a diverse customer base.  The Company also provides a wide selection of flooring enhancements and accessories, including moldings, noise-reducing underlay, adhesives and flooring tools. The Company’s product offering is substantially comprised of proprietary brands, including its flagship Bellawood brand.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score
A



Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
Zacks Style Scores Education - Learn more about the Zacks Style Scores


The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Sector Rank assigns a rating to each of the 16 Sectors based on their average Zacks Rank.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Why Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. Jumped in March
Shares of the flooring specialist bounced back as hopes seemed to grow for a full recovery.

What happened
Shares of Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LL) were moving higher last month, though there was little company-specific news out on the stock. The retailer of wood flooring and other related products had been battered in recent years after a scandal involving illegally treated flooring, but investor confidence seemed to be returning along with a general uptick in home-improvement stocks. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock rose 18.4% in March.

As the chart below shows, the gains mostly came during the last few days of the month.

LL data by YCharts.
So what 
Lumber Liquidators stock reached its highest point in nearly two years on the rally, a sign that investor confidence is returning. As a cyclical, home-improvement retailer, Lumber Liquidators is the type of stock that should have benefited from the post-election rally, but shares continued to trade flat in the intervening months.
As the company continues to dig out of the crisis following a 60 Minutes report that showed high levels of formaldehyde, a carcinogen, in products it was importing from China, it turned in a better-than-expected earnings report in February as comparable sales ticked up 2.8% and its net loss per share narrowed from $0.73 to $0.20.
Also, during the last week of March, the company introduced a new exclusive waterproof click ceramic plank product. While that was unlikely to be the catalyst behind the rally, it shows the company is continuing to innovate to attract new customers.





Now what 
Lumber Liquidators stock continued to rise through the first week of April, jumping 7% on April 3 and peaking at a closing price of $23.19 the following day. The timing of the rally continues to be unexplained, and analysts still expect the company to post a loss this year. However, as the formaldehyde scandal fades further into the past, Lumber Liquidators is bound to return to profitability eventually. The stock was likely to rally sooner or later.

Why Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. Stock Popped 17.7% in June
The hardwood-flooring specialist jumped after entering a favorable settlement with the Consumer Product Safety Commission.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)

Image source: Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc.
What: Shares of Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. (NYSE:LL) rose 17.7% in June, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, with the majority of its gains coming after receiving a positive decision from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).
So what: More specifically, Lumber Liquidators stock climbed more than 20% after it revealed in an SEC filing that, on June 15, it entered into a voluntary agreement with the CPSC's Office of Compliance and Field Operations regarding its laminate flooring products imported from China and sold in the United States. Under that agreement -- and without admitting to any wrongdoing -- Lumber Liquidators will continue to offer to its customers a no-cost voluntary testing program that it's had in place since May 2015, shortly after a scathing 60 Minutes report accused the company of selling Chinese flooring that contained illegally high levels of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. The agreement also lays out tighter supply-chain controls for the company. 
Most notably, the CPSC said it will not recall any of the flooring in question, as that could expose consumers to increased levels of formaldehyde, and instead suggested consumers contact Lumber Liquidators to participate in the testing program. At the same time, the CPSC pointed out that Lumber Liquidators has already tested the air quality in over 17,000 households and retained third-party certified labs to conduct formaldehyde emissions tests for roughly 1,300 of of those consumers' floors. None of those tests came in above remediation guidelines.
Now what: Going forward, the CPSC will touch base with Lumber Liquidators every six months to review its progress and discuss discontinuation of this corrective action plan. But in all, this was an overwhelmingly positive development, considering the alternative could have involved a wide recall of the products -- which Lumber Liquidators no longer sells -- or severe penalties, both of which would have undoubtedly further tarnished Lumber Liquidators' rapport with customers. 





That's not to say its challenges are over just yet; Lumber Liquidators has seen its revenue decline for four straight quarters, while comparable-store sales have fallen in each of its past five quarterly reports. But if the company can ultimately stem these declines as it gradually regains the trust of consumers -- and with shares still trading more than 70% below its 2015 highs before the allegations first surfaced -- Lumber Liquidators stock could have plenty of room to run higher from here.

Lumber Liquidators stock surges after analyst turns bullish for first time in over 2 years
Shares of Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc.  surged 6.7% in morning trade Wednesday, after Wedbush Securities turned bullish on the wood-flooring seller on the belief that improving fundamentals have created a positive risk-versus-reward scenario for investors. Analyst Seth Basham raised his rating to outperform, after being at neutral since February 2015. He raised his stock price target to $27, which is 18% above current levels, from $22. "New CEO Dennis Knowles and his team have stabilized [Lumber Liquidators], and the company is set to grow again," Basham wrote in a note to clients. "With comps and underlying margins improving, we expect EPS to inflect positively as LL distances itself from negative publicity, improves its assortment, enhances its Pro offering and rolls out installation services." The stock at closed at a two-year high $24.55 on April 28, then plunged 14% on May 2 after the company reported a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss. The stock was up 47% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

Lumber Liquidators stock slides 16% after bigger-than-expected quarterly loss
Shares of wood flooring retailer Lumber Liquidators slid 16% Tuesday, after the company posted a far wider-than-expected loss for its first quarter.  The company, which is still recovering from a scandal involving carcinogens in wood laminates it imported from China, said it had a first-quarter net loss of $26.4 million, or 93 cents a share, narrower than the loss of $32.4 million, or $1.20 a share, posted a year ago. But Factset analysts were expecting a much narrower per-share loss of 21 cents. The news overshadowed a small revenue beat: the company posted revenue of $248.4 million, up from $233.5 million in the year-earlier period and ahead of the $247.2 million FactSet consensus. First-quarter gross margin was 34.9%, up from 32.6% a year ago. On a call with analysts, Chief Executive Dennis Knowles said the company "made an important triage in 2015 and 2016 to a solid focus on execution in 2017." However, "as it relates to our turnaround journey we have a lot of work to do," he said. Shares have gained 32% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.6%.

Nasdaq nears the 6,050 technical target, S&P 500 nails next resistance
The U.S. benchmarks’ initially strong technical breakout has been punctuated by muted selling pressure, and in spots, a modest extension of the April spike.  Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has effectively tagged a projected target — the 6,050 area — while the S&P 500 has topped less than three points from record territory.

Lumber Liquidators stock surges after analyst turns bullish for first time in over 2 years
Shares of Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc.  surged 6.7% in morning trade Wednesday, after Wedbush Securities turned bullish on the wood-flooring seller on the belief that improving fundamentals have created a positive risk-versus-reward scenario for investors. Analyst Seth Basham raised his rating to outperform, after being at neutral since February 2015. He raised his stock price target to $27, which is 18% above current levels, from $22. "New CEO Dennis Knowles and his team have stabilized [Lumber Liquidators], and the company is set to grow again," Basham wrote in a note to clients. "With comps and underlying margins improving, we expect EPS to inflect positively as LL distances itself from negative publicity, improves its assortment, enhances its Pro offering and rolls out installation services." The stock at closed at a two-year high $24.55 on April 28, then plunged 14% on May 2 after the company reported a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss. The stock was up 47% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

Lumber Liquidators stock slides 16% after bigger-than-expected quarterly loss
Shares of wood flooring retailer Lumber Liquidators slid 16% Tuesday, after the company posted a far wider-than-expected loss for its first quarter.  The company, which is still recovering from a scandal involving carcinogens in wood laminates it imported from China, said it had a first-quarter net loss of $26.4 million, or 93 cents a share, narrower than the loss of $32.4 million, or $1.20 a share, posted a year ago. But Factset analysts were expecting a much narrower per-share loss of 21 cents. The news overshadowed a small revenue beat: the company posted revenue of $248.4 million, up from $233.5 million in the year-earlier period and ahead of the $247.2 million FactSet consensus. First-quarter gross margin was 34.9%, up from 32.6% a year ago. On a call with analysts, Chief Executive Dennis Knowles said the company "made an important triage in 2015 and 2016 to a solid focus on execution in 2017." However, "as it relates to our turnaround journey we have a lot of work to do," he said. Shares have gained 32% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.6%.

Nasdaq nears the 6,050 technical target, S&P 500 nails next resistance
The U.S. benchmarks’ initially strong technical breakout has been punctuated by muted selling pressure, and in spots, a modest extension of the April spike.  Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has effectively tagged a projected target — the 6,050 area — while the S&P 500 has topped less than three points from record territory.
