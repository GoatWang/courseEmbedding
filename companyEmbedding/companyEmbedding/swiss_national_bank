Central Bank Gold Policies - Swiss National Bank



Highlights


Switzerland’s monetary gold reserves are held by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and valued on the SNB balance sheet at market prices.


Although substantial in size, gold accounts for only 6% of the SNB’s total foreign reserves due to the SNB having expanded its foreign currency reserves over 2011-2015 in an attempt to weaken the Swiss Franc vis-a-vis the Euro.


The SNB sold 1300 tonnes of gold over the 2000 to 2008 period in one of the central bank world’s biggest ever series of gold sales. The SNB’s gold stored in New York was used for much of these sales via location swaps with gold held at the Bank of England in London.


An initiative to force the Swiss National Bank to repatriate its foreign held gold to Switzerland was launched in 2011 by Swiss political party SVF culminating in a country-wide referendum in November 2014. This referendum failed to pass its proposals but did force the SNB to reluctantly divulge some information on its gold storage arrangements.


As well as storing its own gold bars in its headquarters building in Berne, the SNB provides a gold custody service for other central banks. Gold storage customers of the SNB include the Bank of Italy, the Swedish Riksbank, the Bank of Finland, and the Bank for International Settlements.

Swiss National Bank
Introduction
Switzerland maintains the world’s 8th largest official gold reserves, with holdings of 1040 tonnes of gold[1]. These gold reserves are owned by the State but held by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The SNB sold off 1550 tonnes of Switzerland’s gold between 2000 and 2008, at a time when the gold price was rising sharply. Without these gold sales, Switzerland would be the world’s 4th largest official sector gold holder. The SNB is demonstrably secretive about its gold activities and operations, and reveals minimum information to the public.

This referendum failed to pass its proposals but did force the SNB to reluctantly divulge some information on its gold storage arrangements.


As well as storing its own gold bars in its headquarters building in Berne, the SNB provides a gold custody service for other central banks. Gold storage customers of the SNB include the Bank of Italy, the Swedish Riksbank, the Bank of Finland, and the Bank for International Settlements.



Gold Ownership
Under Switzerland’s national gold reserve policy, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) holds and manages Switzerland’s gold reserves. This policy is derived from the Swiss Federal Constitution which grants the SNB its independence and mandate. Article 99 of the Constitution requires that the SNB hold sufficient currency reserves / foreign exchange reserves, part of which must be in the form of gold[2].
SNB Gold Storage
In April 2013, the SNB for the first time clarified the storage locations and locational distribution of Switzerland’s gold reserves, revealing that approximately 70% of Swiss gold reserves are stored in Switzerland, 20% at the Bank of England in London, and 10% with the Bank of Canada in Ottawa[3]. Until that time, the SNB had never revealed the storage locations of the country’s gold, citing security reasons.
The SNB’s 2013 gold storage policy announcement was strategic in nature that it was primarily an attempt to deflect criticism levelled by the promoters of the Swiss Gold Initiative (see below) about the SNB’s lack of transparency on its gold activities. The SNB also claimed in its April 2013 announcement that it had been exclusively storing its gold in Switzerland, the UK and Canada “for over 10 years”.
In October 2014, the SNB revealed that it had previously stored gold at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York[4] but that this gold had been completely sold as part of the Swiss gold sales (see below):
“Stocks that were once The US Federal Reserve (Fed) have been sold”
Swiss Gold Initiative
The Swiss Gold Initiative or ‘Save our Swiss Gold’ campaign was a Federal popular initiative launched by members of the Swiss People’s Party (SVP) in 2011 with the intention of altering the Swiss Federal Constitution.
The “Gold Initiative”, full name “A Swiss Initiative to Secure the Swiss National Bank’s Gold Reserves”, culminated with a referendum on 30 November 2014 which asked the Swiss population to vote on three proposals concerning Switzerland’s national gold reserves:

The gold of the Swiss National Bank must be stored physically in Switzerland
The Swiss National Bank does not have the right to sell its gold reserves
The Swiss National Bank must hold at least twenty percent (20%) of its total assets in gold.

Although the referendum was not successful and did not get the required majority of votes on the day, it did force the Swiss National Bank to divulge a lot more information about the Swiss gold reserves than it ever otherwise would have revealed, and also showed up the SNB to be inconsistent in its continual excuses for opposing the referendum motions[5].
Gold Sales 2000 – 2008
Prior to 2000, Switzerland held 2,590 tonnes of gold, making the country the world’s 4th largest official gold holders. However, between 2000 and 2005, and again between 2007 and 2008, the SNB sold off a combined 1,550 tonnes of its gold reserves[6].
These gold sales programs were pre-planned in the 1990s by the SNB and elements within the Swiss Government even though the central bank at that time did not have authorisation to sell any gold. However, through a series of manoeuvres, this ‘sell gold’ contingent within the Swiss central bank and finance ministry axis succeeded in convincing the Swiss government and people to self-detonate their nation’s store of wealth.
Firstly in 1997, the Constitutional requirement for the Swiss Franc to be 40% backed by gold was lowered to a 25% backing. Subsequently in 1997, an ‘Expert Group’ made up of the SNB and staff from the Swiss Federal Administration recommended that Switzerland should sell 1,300 tonnes of gold, arguing that with a reduced 25% gold backing requirement, Switzerland would otherwise end up holding surplus gold.
In April 2000, further constitutional amendments were put to the Swiss electorate which proposed dropping the 25% gold backing for the currency and severing the link between the Swiss Franc and gold. These amendments passed after which the Swiss National Bank proceeded to sell 1300 tonnes of gold between 2000 and 2005, all sales of which fell under the first and second Central Bank Gold Agreements which coordinated gold sales among European central banks.
Between May and September 2000 the SNB sold 120 tonnes of gold. Over the subsequent 12 months from October 2000 to September 2001, the SNB sold another 200 tonnes. The first 220 tonnes of these sales were executed by the Bank for International Settlements on behalf of the SNB. The SNB then directly executed gold sales itself from October 2001, selling 980 tonnes over four years until September 2005.
Of the 1300 tonne total sold between 2000 and 2005, 730 tonnes settled using gold at the Bank of England[7].
Between 2007 and 2008, the SNB sold an additional 250 tonnes of its remaining gold, claiming that it needed to rebalance its reserves between foreign currencies and gold. The combined gold sales from 2000 to 2008 totalled 1550 tonnes, and reduced Switzerland’s gold holdings from 2590 tonnes to 1300 tonnes.
Swiss National Bank Gold Vault – Berne
While the SNB has confirmed that approximately 70% of its gold is held in Switzerland, it has not divulged the exact storage location. However the SNB maintains its own gold vaults under its headquarters on the Bundesplatz in Berne, and Swiss media believe that the Swiss gold is most likely stored there[8]. The SNB’s gold vaults in Berne have also been captured in published photographs, for example, as per the following shots:


 
Swiss National Bank as Gold Custodian
A number of other central banks and official monetary institutions, such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), are on record as storing some of their gold reserves with the SNB in Berne. This also confirms the existence and location of the SNB’s gold vaults. Therefore, the SNB does not just store its own gold, it stores gold on behalf of fellow central banks.
The BIS does not have its own gold vaults in Switzerland or anywhere else. However the BIS offers gold custody facilities, term gold deposit facilities and spot and forward purchase and sale gold transactions with settlement ‘loco London’, loco New York, and ‘loco Berne’[9]. For ‘loco Berne’ the BIS uses the SNB’s gold vaults.
The Banca d’Italia revealed in 2014 that it holds a small percentage of its gold with the Swiss National Bank through a BIS account arrangement[10]. The Swedish Riksbank announced in October 2013 that it holds 2.8 tonnes of gold (or 2.2% of its overall gold reserves) with the Swiss National Bank[11]. The Bank of Finland also announced in October 2013 that it holds 3.43 tonnes (7%) of its gold reserves in the custody of the SNB[12].
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) also facilitates gold lending operations for its central bank customers and therefore indirectly it provides gold custody services to commercial banks in the context of gold lending operations. However, the SNB does not offer commercial banks gold storage services beyond transactions linked to gold lending.
Gold Lending operations of the SNB 
The SNB claims to have not undertaken any lending of its own gold since 2012. In 2016, the SNB confirmed to BullionStar that:
“Since 2012, there are no outstanding claims from gold lending in the SNB’s balance sheet.”
The SNB 2012 annual report states that:
“In managing its investment portfolio, the SNB lends part of its gold holdings to first-class domestic and foreign financial institutions. It receives interest in return. Gold lending transactions are effected on a secured basis. The gold price risk remains with the SNB. Gold loans are entered in the balance sheet under claims from gold transactions and stated at market value inclusive of accrued interest. The valuation result and interest are stated under net result from gold.”[13]
The SNB’s 2011 balance sheet shows an amount of 14.9 tonnes under line item ‘Claims from gold transactions’, and nil under the same line item for year-end 2012.
When the SNB did engage in gold lending in the 2000s, its gold lending program was manged by then SNB senior manager Michael [14]. Paprotta was also responsible for the SNB’s gold sales program[15][16].
Valuation and Reporting
Like its major neighbour central banks in France, Germany and Italy, the Switzerland central bank holds substantial gold reserves, however, unlike the French, German and Italian central banks, the SNB’s gold reserves make up a very small percentage of its total foreign reserve assets. This is because the SNB rapidly expanded its balance sheet between 2011 and 2015 due to pursuing a monetary policy goal of maintaining a target exchange rate between the Swiss Franc and the Euro of 1.20, which necessitated the purchase of huge amounts of foreign currency (which produced the bloated balance sheet).
The SNB holds its gold reserves as an asset on its balance sheet in the form of monetary gold, which is classified as line item “Gold Holdings” and is valued at financial year-end at a market price in CHF (Swiss Francs) per kilogram[17].
Form of gold holdings
The SNB states in its annual reports that its “gold holdings consist of gold ingots and gold coins”. In another SNB publications titled ‘The Swiss National Bank in Brief’, the SNB states that its “gold holdings are mainly in the form of gold bars, with the remainder in gold coins”[18].
However, in response to a BullionStar question about the types of gold coins held by the SNB, the Swiss central bank responded that it “does not publish details regarding gold bars and gold coins.” This again shows the secrecy and lack of transparency with which the SNB actually acts in matters related to its gold holdings and gold activities.

History[edit]
The bank formed as a result of the need for a reduction in the number of banks of issue, which numbered 53 sometime after 1826. In the 1874 revision of the Federal Constitution it was given the task to oversee laws concerning the issuing of banknotes. Then in 1891 the Federal Constitution was revised again to entrust the Confederation with sole rights to issue banknotes. The National Bank Law was enforced on 16 January 1906, and the Nationalbank began business activities on 20 June 1907, and is thought then founded sometime during either 1906 or 1907.[1][2] SNB itself states that it was founded in 1907.[3]
Sometime during World War I (1914-1917 [4]), the bank was instructed to release notes of a small denomination, for the first time, by the Federal Council of Switzerland.[1]
The Bundesrat devalued the Swiss Franc during 1936, and as a result, there was made available to the Nationalbank, an amount of monies, which the bank subsequently stored in a Währungsausgleischsfonds reserve for the future, for usage in situations of emergency.[5]
In 1981 the bank participated in research involving Orell Füssli and an optical research group named Landis and Gyr, of matters of banknote design.[6]
During 1994 the Bank was described as a joint-stock company acting under the administration and supervision of the Confederation. It had eight branches and twenty sub-branches within cantons. The governing board had overall executive management of the Nationalbank, with supervision entrusted to its shareholders, the banks' council, the banks' committee, its local committees and auditing committee. There were three members of the governing board, who together decided the monetary policy of the Nationalbank. Towards the end of 1993, there were 566 employees.[1]
With the inception of Article 99 of the Federal Constitution, in May 2004, the Nationalbank achieved formal independence.[7]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2015 the Nationalbank is privately owned,[8] with the majority of shares belonging to the Swiss cantons (45%) and the banks of the cantons (15%), and the smaller remainder in the possession of private individuals (40%).[9][10][11] Shares of the SNB existed within SIX Swiss Exchange from 1907 onward.[12]
Exchange rates[edit]
The Nationalbank made an announcement on 6 September 2011, of its intention to address changes in the value of the Swiss Franc to the Euro. More specifically, that it wanted the value of the Franc to fall below 1.2 to the Euro. A cap was placed on exchange-rates [13] in order to take measures to stem the development of a possible recession. The bank stated the 1.2 exchange value was defendable as the bank could potentially proceed to mint enough banknotes to control the rate sufficiently.[14] The bank announced on January 15, 2015 the Euro currency arrangement would end as the Euro crisis had passed and the Europeans would be making financial policy changes.[15]
Responsibilities[edit]

Signed by K. Bornhauser (Chief Cashier), Johann-Daniel Hirter (President of the Swiss National Bank Council), and August Burckhardt (Board member).


The basic governing principles of the Nationalbank are contained within Article 99 of the Federal Constitution, which deals with matters of monetary policy.[16] There are three numbered factors concerning principles explicitly mentioning the Nationalbank, of four altogether shown within the Article. The SNB is therefore obliged by constitutional statute law to act in accordance with the economic interests of Switzerland,[17] accordingly, the prime function of the Nationalbank is:[18]

to pursue a reliable monetary policy for the benefit of the Swiss economy and the Swiss people.

The Nationalbank publishes within its own site a list of research done as work in progress by staff members, which begin at 2004 (2 papers), to 2005 (2), 2006 (11), 2007 (17), 2008 (19), 2009 (16), 2010 (19), 2011 (14), 2012 (16), 2013 (11), 2014 (13), and to 1 August 2015 there is shown nine papers,[19] a list of eight economic studies which relate to the tasks of the bank, listed from 2005,[20] in addition to a bi-annually published update of research, listed from 2012 to the present.[21]
Cash supply and distribution[edit]
The National Bank is entrusted with the note-issuing privilege. It supplies the economy with banknotes that meet high standards with respect to quality and security. It is also charged by the Confederation with the task of coin distribution.
Cashless payment transactions[edit]
In the field of cashless payment transactions, the National Bank provides services for payments between banks. These are settled in the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) system via sight deposit accounts held with the National Bank.
Investment of currency reserves[edit]
The National Bank manages currency reserves. These engender confidence in the Swiss franc, help to prevent and overcome crises and may be utilized for interventions in the foreign exchange market.
Financial system stability[edit]
The National Bank contributes to the stability of the financial system by acting as an arbiter over monetary policy. Within the context of this task, it analyses sources of risk to the financial system, oversees systemically important payment and securities settlement systems and helps to promote an operational environment for the financial sector.
International monetary cooperation[edit]
Together with the federal authorities, the National Bank participates in international monetary cooperation and provides technical assistance.
Banker to the Confederation[edit]
The National Bank acts as banker to the Swiss Confederation. It processes payments on behalf of the Confederation, issues money market debt register claims and bonds, handles the safekeeping of securities and carries out money market and foreign exchange transactions.
Statistics[edit]
The National Bank compiles statistical data on banks and financial markets, the balance of payments, the international investment position and the Swiss financial accounts.
Monetary policy[edit]
The SNB pursues a monetary policy serving the interests of the country as a whole. It must ensure price stability, while taking due account of economic developments. Monetary policy affects production and prices with a considerable time lag. Consequently, it is based on inflation forecasts rather than current inflation. The SNB’s monetary policy strategy consists of three elements: a definition of price stability (the SNB equates price stability with a rise in the national consumer price index of less than 2% per year), a medium-term conditional inflation forecast, and, at operational level, a target range for a reference interest rate, which is the Libor for three-month investments in Swiss francs.
General Meeting of Shareholders[edit]
The General Meeting of Shareholders is held once a year, as a rule in April. Owing to the SNB’s public mandate, the powers of the Shareholders’ Meeting are not as extensive as in joint-stock companies under private law.
Bank Council[edit]
The Bank Council oversees and controls the conduct of business by the Swiss National Bank and consists of 11 members. Six members, including the President and Vice President, are appointed by the Federal Council, and five by the Shareholders’ Meeting. The Bank Council sets up four committees from its own ranks: an Audit Committee, a Risk Committee, a Remuneration Committee and an Appointment Committee.
A list of the Bank Council members is published on the SNB website (see: http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/snb/bodies/id/snb_bodies_council )
Governing Board[edit]
The Swiss National Bank’s management and executive body is the Governing Board. The Governing Board is responsible in particular for monetary policy, asset management strategy, contributing to the stability of the financial system and international monetary cooperation. The Governing Board consists of 3 members:

Chairman: Thomas Jordan[22]
Vice Chairman: Fritz Zurbrügg [22]
Member: Andréa M. Maechler

Gold reserves[edit]




Switzerland's gold reserves


The SNB manages the official gold reserves of Switzerland, which as of 2008 amount to 1145 tonnes and are valued at 30.5 billion CHF.[23] The gold is believed to be stored in huge vaults beneath the Federal Square (Bundesplatz) to the north of the federal Parliament building in Bern, but the SNB treats the location of the gold reserves as a secret.[23] Independent confirmation of the gold's location was obtained by the Bernese newspaper Der Bund in 2008. It published a photograph of the bullion that a keystone photographer was allowed to take at the SNB premises in Bern in 2001. Der Bund also quoted a retired official of the city's surveying office as saying that the gold vaults take up an area of roughly half the Federal Square and have a depth of dozens of meters, down to the level of the Aar river.[23] The SNB says that the gold reserves are stored in different safe places in Switzerland (70%) and abroad (i.e. Bank of England and Bank of Canada).[24]
From the latter years of the 1990s until sometime during 2005, the Nationalbank transferred from its possession an amount of gold deemed superfluous.[5]
World War II[edit]
See also: World War II
The Swiss National Bank provided 1.2 billion CHF to the Reichsbank, of this, a value of approximately 780 million CHF of the gold given to the Nationalbank was gold which had been looted by the forces of Germany. In addition the Nationalbank also exchanged between 1.2–1.6 billion CHF for gold from the Allied forces.[25] During 20 April 1944, gold from the gold reserves of Italy arrived from Como at the railway station within Chiasso.[26]
There is controversy over the role of the Swiss National Bank in the transfer of Nazi gold during World War II. The SNB was the largest gold distribution centre in continental Europe before the war. A study by the U.S. Department of State in 1997 notes that the Bank, "must have known that some portion of the gold it was receiving from the Reichsbank was looted from occupied countries."[27] This was confirmed by the Swiss Bergier commission in 1998 which concluded that the SNB received US$440 million in gold from Nazi sources,[28] of which US$316 million is estimated to have been looted.[citation needed] The gold from Nazi governship sources was in the form of ingots containing gold looted from Central Banks of Europe and gold from Jewish persons executed within the concentration camps established by the machination of the Nazi regime, which the SNB took without knowing these facts at the time, nor inquiring to any great degree in the process of its transfer into the possession of the SNB, according to a former Archivist of the SNB Robert Vogler.[29]
Reports[edit]
The Nationalbank had profits of $39.3 billion at the close of 2014.[30]
On 31 July 2015, the bank reported a first-half loss of £33 billion.[31]

History[edit]
The bank formed as a result of the need for a reduction in the number of banks of issue, which numbered 53 sometime after 1826. In the 1874 revision of the Federal Constitution it was given the task to oversee laws concerning the issuing of banknotes. Then in 1891 the Federal Constitution was revised again to entrust the Confederation with sole rights to issue banknotes. The National Bank Law was enforced on 16 January 1906, and the Nationalbank began business activities on 20 June 1907, and is thought then founded sometime during either 1906 or 1907.[1][2] SNB itself states that it was founded in 1907.[3]
Sometime during World War I (1914-1917 [4]), the bank was instructed to release notes of a small denomination, for the first time, by the Federal Council of Switzerland.[1]
The Bundesrat devalued the Swiss Franc during 1936, and as a result, there was made available to the Nationalbank, an amount of monies, which the bank subsequently stored in a Währungsausgleischsfonds reserve for the future, for usage in situations of emergency.[5]
In 1981 the bank participated in research involving Orell Füssli and an optical research group named Landis and Gyr, of matters of banknote design.[6]
During 1994 the Bank was described as a joint-stock company acting under the administration and supervision of the Confederation. It had eight branches and twenty sub-branches within cantons. The governing board had overall executive management of the Nationalbank, with supervision entrusted to its shareholders, the banks' council, the banks' committee, its local committees and auditing committee. There were three members of the governing board, who together decided the monetary policy of the Nationalbank. Towards the end of 1993, there were 566 employees.[1]
With the inception of Article 99 of the Federal Constitution, in May 2004, the Nationalbank achieved formal independence.[7]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2015 the Nationalbank is privately owned,[8] with the majority of shares belonging to the Swiss cantons (45%) and the banks of the cantons (15%), and the smaller remainder in the possession of private individuals (40%).[9][10][11] Shares of the SNB existed within SIX Swiss Exchange from 1907 onward.[12]
Exchange rates[edit]
The Nationalbank made an announcement on 6 September 2011, of its intention to address changes in the value of the Swiss Franc to the Euro. More specifically, that it wanted the value of the Franc to fall below 1.2 to the Euro. A cap was placed on exchange-rates [13] in order to take measures to stem the development of a possible recession. The bank stated the 1.2 exchange value was defendable as the bank could potentially proceed to mint enough banknotes to control the rate sufficiently.[14] The bank announced on January 15, 2015 the Euro currency arrangement would end as the Euro crisis had passed and the Europeans would be making financial policy changes.[15]
Responsibilities[edit]

The basic governing principles of the Nationalbank are contained within Article 99 of the Federal Constitution, which deals with matters of monetary policy.[16] There are three numbered factors concerning principles explicitly mentioning the Nationalbank, of four altogether shown within the Article. The SNB is therefore obliged by constitutional statute law to act in accordance with the economic interests of Switzerland,[17] accordingly, the prime function of the Nationalbank is:[18]

to pursue a reliable monetary policy for the benefit of the Swiss economy and the Swiss people.

The Nationalbank publishes within its own site a list of research done as work in progress by staff members, which begin at 2004 (2 papers), to 2005 (2), 2006 (11), 2007 (17), 2008 (19), 2009 (16), 2010 (19), 2011 (14), 2012 (16), 2013 (11), 2014 (13), and to 1 August 2015 there is shown nine papers,[19] a list of eight economic studies which relate to the tasks of the bank, listed from 2005,[20] in addition to a bi-annually published update of research, listed from 2012 to the present.[21]
Cash supply and distribution[edit]
The National Bank is entrusted with the note-issuing privilege. It supplies the economy with banknotes that meet high standards with respect to quality and security. It is also charged by the Confederation with the task of coin distribution.
Cashless payment transactions[edit]
In the field of cashless payment transactions, the National Bank provides services for payments between banks. These are settled in the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) system via sight deposit accounts held with the National Bank.
Investment of currency reserves[edit]
The National Bank manages currency reserves. These engender confidence in the Swiss franc, help to prevent and overcome crises and may be utilized for interventions in the foreign exchange market.
Financial system stability[edit]
The National Bank contributes to the stability of the financial system by acting as an arbiter over monetary policy. Within the context of this task, it analyses sources of risk to the financial system, oversees systemically important payment and securities settlement systems and helps to promote an operational environment for the financial sector.
International monetary cooperation[edit]
Together with the federal authorities, the National Bank participates in international monetary cooperation and provides technical assistance.
Banker to the Confederation[edit]
The National Bank acts as banker to the Swiss Confederation. It processes payments on behalf of the Confederation, issues money market debt register claims and bonds, handles the safekeeping of securities and carries out money market and foreign exchange transactions.
Statistics[edit]
The National Bank compiles statistical data on banks and financial markets, the balance of payments, the international investment position and the Swiss financial accounts.
Monetary policy[edit]
The SNB pursues a monetary policy serving the interests of the country as a whole. It must ensure price stability, while taking due account of economic developments. Monetary policy affects production and prices with a considerable time lag. Consequently, it is based on inflation forecasts rather than current inflation. The SNB’s monetary policy strategy consists of three elements: a definition of price stability (the SNB equates price stability with a rise in the national consumer price index of less than 2% per year), a medium-term conditional inflation forecast, and, at operational level, a target range for a reference interest rate, which is the Libor for three-month investments in Swiss francs.
General Meeting of Shareholders[edit]
The General Meeting of Shareholders is held once a year, as a rule in April. Owing to the SNB’s public mandate, the powers of the Shareholders’ Meeting are not as extensive as in joint-stock companies under private law.
Bank Council[edit]
The Bank Council oversees and controls the conduct of business by the Swiss National Bank and consists of 11 members. Six members, including the President and Vice President, are appointed by the Federal Council, and five by the Shareholders’ Meeting. The Bank Council sets up four committees from its own ranks: an Audit Committee, a Risk Committee, a Remuneration Committee and an Appointment Committee.
A list of the Bank Council members is published on the SNB website (see: http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/snb/bodies/id/snb_bodies_council )
Governing Board[edit]
The Swiss National Bank’s management and executive body is the Governing Board. The Governing Board is responsible in particular for monetary policy, asset management strategy, contributing to the stability of the financial system and international monetary cooperation. The Governing Board consists of 3 members:

Chairman: Thomas Jordan[22]
Vice Chairman: Fritz Zurbrügg [22]
Member: Andréa M. Maechler

Gold reserves[edit]




Switzerland's gold reserves


The SNB manages the official gold reserves of Switzerland, which as of 2008 amount to 1145 tonnes and are valued at 30.5 billion CHF.[23] The gold is believed to be stored in huge vaults beneath the Federal Square (Bundesplatz) to the north of the federal Parliament building in Bern, but the SNB treats the location of the gold reserves as a secret.[23] Independent confirmation of the gold's location was obtained by the Bernese newspaper Der Bund in 2008. It published a photograph of the bullion that a keystone photographer was allowed to take at the SNB premises in Bern in 2001. Der Bund also quoted a retired official of the city's surveying office as saying that the gold vaults take up an area of roughly half the Federal Square and have a depth of dozens of meters, down to the level of the Aar river.[23] The SNB says that the gold reserves are stored in different safe places in Switzerland (70%) and abroad (i.e. Bank of England and Bank of Canada).[24]
From the latter years of the 1990s until sometime during 2005, the Nationalbank transferred from its possession an amount of gold deemed superfluous.[5]
World War II[edit]
See also: World War II
The Swiss National Bank provided 1.2 billion CHF to the Reichsbank, of this, a value of approximately 780 million CHF of the gold given to the Nationalbank was gold which had been looted by the forces of Germany. In addition the Nationalbank also exchanged between 1.2–1.6 billion CHF for gold from the Allied forces.[25] During 20 April 1944, gold from the gold reserves of Italy arrived from Como at the railway station within Chiasso.[26]
There is controversy over the role of the Swiss National Bank in the transfer of Nazi gold during World War II. The SNB was the largest gold distribution centre in continental Europe before the war. A study by the U.S. Department of State in 1997 notes that the Bank, "must have known that some portion of the gold it was receiving from the Reichsbank was looted from occupied countries."[27] This was confirmed by the Swiss Bergier commission in 1998 which concluded that the SNB received US$440 million in gold from Nazi sources,[28] of which US$316 million is estimated to have been looted.[citation needed] The gold from Nazi governship sources was in the form of ingots containing gold looted from Central Banks of Europe and gold from Jewish persons executed within the concentration camps established by the machination of the Nazi regime, which the SNB took without knowing these facts at the time, nor inquiring to any great degree in the process of its transfer into the possession of the SNB, according to a former Archivist of the SNB Robert Vogler.[29]
Reports[edit]
The Nationalbank had profits of $39.3 billion at the close of 2014.[30]
On 31 July 2015, the bank reported a first-half loss of £33 billion.[31]

Swiss National Bank: Franc 'significantly overvalued'

A man looks at a board showing currency exchange rates in Bern January 15, 2015.


  The Swiss National Bank (SNB) decided to keep its main interest rate at -0.75 percent on Thursday, saying that the Swiss franc was still "significantly overvalued." 
  The bank adopted negative interest rates last December in a bid to deter investors from depositing their money in the country's banks which in turn causes the Swiss franc to fall. 
  In its latest monetary policy assessment published on Thursday, the bank said: "Overall, the Swiss franc is still significantly overvalued, despite a slight depreciation." 

"The negative interest rates in Switzerland and the SNB's willingness to intervene as required in the foreign exchange market make investments in Swiss francs less attractive; both of these factors serve to ease the pressure on the franc," it said.
  Earlier in September, the currency weakened past the psychologically important 1.10 level against the euro - the lowest level since the bank' s surprise removal of the minimum exchange rate of 1.20 francs per euro at the beginning of the year, which caused the currency to soar 30 percent against the euro. 
After the decision on Thursday, the Swiss franc was trading at 1.0954 against the single currency.
  Some analyst believe the Swiss franc's status as a safe-haven is gradually eroding, however, and analysts at Unicredit said recently that "there is plenty of room left for the Swiss franc to depreciate further. 
  The sharp rise in the currency and the pressure that put on Swiss exports, which were rendered more expensive, has put pressure on the economy,  the Swiss government said on Thursday as it forecast "below-average" economic growth this year and next. 
  Gross domestic product (GDP) will expand 0.9 percent in 2015 and 1.5 per cent in 2016, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) in Bern. 
  In a statement, SECO said "the sharp rise in the value of the Swiss franc from mid-January put a significant brake on the Swiss economy during the first half of 2015." 
  "Despite a slight easing in the exchange rate situation over the last few weeks the Expert Group continues to anticipate that the economy will remain very subdued in the second half of the year and is likely to only start to strengthen again during the course of 2016."  
  It said a key prerequisite for an improvement in the economic situation is that the global economy remains on an upward course and, in particular, that the euro zone is able to continue its recovery.

History[edit]
The bank formed as a result of the need for a reduction in the number of banks of issue, which numbered 53 sometime after 1826. In the 1874 revision of the Federal Constitution it was given the task to oversee laws concerning the issuing of banknotes. Then in 1891 the Federal Constitution was revised again to entrust the Confederation with sole rights to issue banknotes. The National Bank Law was enforced on 16 January 1906, and the Nationalbank began business activities on 20 June 1907, and is thought then founded sometime during either 1906 or 1907.[1][2] SNB itself states that it was founded in 1907.[3]
Sometime during World War I (1914-1917 [4]), the bank was instructed to release notes of a small denomination, for the first time, by the Federal Council of Switzerland.[1]
The Bundesrat devalued the Swiss Franc during 1936, and as a result, there was made available to the Nationalbank, an amount of monies, which the bank subsequently stored in a Währungsausgleischsfonds reserve for the future, for usage in situations of emergency.[5]
In 1981 the bank participated in research involving Orell Füssli and an optical research group named Landis and Gyr, of matters of banknote design.[6]
During 1994 the Bank was described as a joint-stock company acting under the administration and supervision of the Confederation. It had eight branches and twenty sub-branches within cantons. The governing board had overall executive management of the Nationalbank, with supervision entrusted to its shareholders, the banks' council, the banks' committee, its local committees and auditing committee. There were three members of the governing board, who together decided the monetary policy of the Nationalbank. Towards the end of 1993, there were 566 employees.[1]
With the inception of Article 99 of the Federal Constitution, in May 2004, the Nationalbank achieved formal independence.[7]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2015 the Nationalbank is privately owned,[8] with the majority of shares belonging to the Swiss cantons (45%) and the banks of the cantons (15%), and the smaller remainder in the possession of private individuals (40%).[9][10][11] Shares of the SNB existed within SIX Swiss Exchange from 1907 onward.[12]
Exchange rates[edit]
The Nationalbank made an announcement on 6 September 2011, of its intention to address changes in the value of the Swiss Franc to the Euro.

Monetary policy[edit]
The SNB pursues a monetary policy serving the interests of the country as a whole. It must ensure price stability, while taking due account of economic developments. Monetary policy affects production and prices with a considerable time lag. Consequently, it is based on inflation forecasts rather than current inflation. The SNB’s monetary policy strategy consists of three elements: a definition of price stability (the SNB equates price stability with a rise in the national consumer price index of less than 2% per year), a medium-term conditional inflation forecast, and, at operational level, a target range for a reference interest rate, which is the Libor for three-month investments in Swiss francs.
General Meeting of Shareholders[edit]
The General Meeting of Shareholders is held once a year, as a rule in April. Owing to the SNB’s public mandate, the powers of the Shareholders’ Meeting are not as extensive as in joint-stock companies under private law.

The Bank Council oversees and controls the conduct of business by the Swiss National Bank and consists of 11 members. Six members, including the President and Vice President, are appointed by the Federal Council, and five by the Shareholders’ Meeting.

The Governing Board consists of 3 members:

Chairman: Thomas Jordan[22]
Vice Chairman: Fritz Zurbrügg [22]
Member: Andréa M. Maechler

Gold reserves[edit]




Switzerland's gold reserves


The SNB manages the official gold reserves of Switzerland, which as of 2008 amount to 1145 tonnes and are valued at 30.5 billion CHF.[23] The gold is believed to be stored in huge vaults beneath the Federal Square (Bundesplatz) to the north of the federal Parliament building in Bern, but the SNB treats the location of the gold reserves as a secret.[23] Independent confirmation of the gold's location was obtained by the Bernese newspaper Der Bund in 2008. It published a photograph of the bullion that a keystone photographer was allowed to take at the SNB premises in Bern in 2001. Der Bund also quoted a retired official of the city's surveying office as saying that the gold vaults take up an area of roughly half the Federal Square and have a depth of dozens of meters, down to the level of the Aar river.[23] The SNB says that the gold reserves are stored in different safe places in Switzerland (70%) and abroad (i.e. Bank of England and Bank of Canada).[24]
From the latter years of the 1990s until sometime during 2005, the Nationalbank transferred from its possession an amount of gold deemed superfluous.[5]
World War II[edit]
See also: World War II
The Swiss National Bank provided 1.2 billion CHF to the Reichsbank, of this, a value of approximately 780 million CHF of the gold given to the Nationalbank was gold which had been looted by the forces of Germany. In addition the Nationalbank also exchanged between 1.2–1.6 billion CHF for gold from the Allied forces.[25] During 20 April 1944, gold from the gold reserves of Italy arrived from Como at the railway station within Chiasso.[26]
There is controversy over the role of the Swiss National Bank in the transfer of Nazi gold during World War II. The SNB was the largest gold distribution centre in continental Europe before the war. A study by the U.S. Department of State in 1997 notes that the Bank, "must have known that some portion of the gold it was receiving from the Reichsbank was looted from occupied countries."[27] This was confirmed by the Swiss Bergier commission in 1998 which concluded that the SNB received US$440 million in gold from Nazi sources,[28] of which US$316 million is estimated to have been looted.[citation needed] The gold from Nazi governship sources was in the form of ingots containing gold looted from Central Banks of Europe and gold from Jewish persons executed within the concentration camps established by the machination of the Nazi regime, which the SNB took without knowing these facts at the time, nor inquiring to any great degree in the process of its transfer into the possession of the SNB, according to a former Archivist of the SNB Robert Vogler.[29]
Reports[edit]
The Nationalbank had profits of $39.3 billion at the close of 2014.[30]
On 31 July 2015, the bank reported a first-half loss of £33 billion.[31]

History[edit]
The bank formed as a result of the need for a reduction in the number of banks of issue, which numbered 53 sometime after 1826. In the 1874 revision of the Federal Constitution it was given the task to oversee laws concerning the issuing of banknotes. Then in 1891 the Federal Constitution was revised again to entrust the Confederation with sole rights to issue banknotes. The National Bank Law was enforced on 16 January 1906, and the Nationalbank began business activities on 20 June 1907, and is thought then founded sometime during either 1906 or 1907.[1][2] SNB itself states that it was founded in 1907.[3]
Sometime during World War I (1914-1917 [4]), the bank was instructed to release notes of a small denomination, for the first time, by the Federal Council of Switzerland.[1]
The Bundesrat devalued the Swiss Franc during 1936, and as a result, there was made available to the Nationalbank, an amount of monies, which the bank subsequently stored in a Währungsausgleischsfonds reserve for the future, for usage in situations of emergency.[5]
In 1981 the bank participated in research involving Orell Füssli and an optical research group named Landis and Gyr, of matters of banknote design.[6]
During 1994 the Bank was described as a joint-stock company acting under the administration and supervision of the Confederation. It had eight branches and twenty sub-branches within cantons. The governing board had overall executive management of the Nationalbank, with supervision entrusted to its shareholders, the banks' council, the banks' committee, its local committees and auditing committee. There were three members of the governing board, who together decided the monetary policy of the Nationalbank. Towards the end of 1993, there were 566 employees.[1]
With the inception of Article 99 of the Federal Constitution, in May 2004, the Nationalbank achieved formal independence.[7]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2015 the Nationalbank is privately owned,[8] with the majority of shares belonging to the Swiss cantons (45%) and the banks of the cantons (15%), and the smaller remainder in the possession of private individuals (40%).[9][10][11] Shares of the SNB existed within SIX Swiss Exchange from 1907 onward.[12]
Exchange rates[edit]
The Nationalbank made an announcement on 6 September 2011, of its intention to address changes in the value of the Swiss Franc to the Euro. More specifically, that it wanted the value of the Franc to fall below 1.2 to the Euro. A cap was placed on exchange-rates [13] in order to take measures to stem the development of a possible recession. The bank stated the 1.2 exchange value was defendable as the bank could potentially proceed to mint enough banknotes to control the rate sufficiently.[14] The bank announced on January 15, 2015 the Euro currency arrangement would end as the Euro crisis had passed and the Europeans would be making financial policy changes.[15]

It published a photograph of the bullion that a keystone photographer was allowed to take at the SNB premises in Bern in 2001. Der Bund also quoted a retired official of the city's surveying office as saying that the gold vaults take up an area of roughly half the Federal Square and have a depth of dozens of meters, down to the level of the Aar river.[23] The SNB says that the gold reserves are stored in different safe places in Switzerland (70%) and abroad (i.e. Bank of England and Bank of Canada).[24]

In addition the Nationalbank also exchanged between 1.2–1.6 billion CHF for gold from the Allied forces.[25] During 20 April 1944, gold from the gold reserves of Italy arrived from Como at the railway station within Chiasso.[26]
There is controversy over the role of the Swiss National Bank in the transfer of Nazi gold during World War II. The SNB was the largest gold distribution centre in continental Europe before the war. A study by the U.S. Department of State in 1997 notes that the Bank, "must have known that some portion of the gold it was receiving from the Reichsbank was looted from occupied countries."[27] This was confirmed by the Swiss Bergier commission in 1998 which concluded that the SNB received US$440 million in gold from Nazi sources,[28] of which US$316 million is estimated to have been looted.[citation needed] The gold from Nazi governship sources was in the form of ingots containing gold looted from Central Banks of Europe and gold from Jewish persons executed within the concentration camps established by the machination of the Nazi regime, which the SNB took without knowing these facts at the time, nor inquiring to any great degree in the process of its transfer into the possession of the SNB, according to a former Archivist of the SNB Robert Vogler.[29]
Reports[edit]
The Nationalbank had profits of $39.3 billion at the close of 2014.[30]
On 31 July 2015, the bank reported a first-half loss of £33 billion.[31]

History[edit]
The bank formed as a result of the need for a reduction in the number of banks of issue, which numbered 53 sometime after 1826. In the 1874 revision of the Federal Constitution it was given the task to oversee laws concerning the issuing of banknotes. Then in 1891 the Federal Constitution was revised again to entrust the Confederation with sole rights to issue banknotes. The National Bank Law was enforced on 16 January 1906, and the Nationalbank began business activities on 20 June 1907, and is thought then founded sometime during either 1906 or 1907.[1][2] SNB itself states that it was founded in 1907.[3]
Sometime during World War I (1914-1917 [4]), the bank was instructed to release notes of a small denomination, for the first time, by the Federal Council of Switzerland.[1]
The Bundesrat devalued the Swiss Franc during 1936, and as a result, there was made available to the Nationalbank, an amount of monies, which the bank subsequently stored in a Währungsausgleischsfonds reserve for the future, for usage in situations of emergency.[5]
In 1981 the bank participated in research involving Orell Füssli and an optical research group named Landis and Gyr, of matters of banknote design.[6]
During 1994 the Bank was described as a joint-stock company acting under the administration and supervision of the Confederation. It had eight branches and twenty sub-branches within cantons. The governing board had overall executive management of the Nationalbank, with supervision entrusted to its shareholders, the banks' council, the banks' committee, its local committees and auditing committee. There were three members of the governing board, who together decided the monetary policy of the Nationalbank. Towards the end of 1993, there were 566 employees.[1]
With the inception of Article 99 of the Federal Constitution, in May 2004, the Nationalbank achieved formal independence.[7]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2015 the Nationalbank is privately owned,[8] with the majority of shares belonging to the Swiss cantons (45%) and the banks of the cantons (15%), and the smaller remainder in the possession of private individuals (40%).[9][10][11] Shares of the SNB existed within SIX Swiss Exchange from 1907 onward.[12]
Exchange rates[edit]
The Nationalbank made an announcement on 6 September 2011, of its intention to address changes in the value of the Swiss Franc to the Euro. More specifically, that it wanted the value of the Franc to fall below 1.2 to the Euro. A cap was placed on exchange-rates [13] in order to take measures to stem the development of a possible recession. The bank stated the 1.2 exchange value was defendable as the bank could potentially proceed to mint enough banknotes to control the rate sufficiently.[14] The bank announced on January 15, 2015 the Euro currency arrangement would end as the Euro crisis had passed and the Europeans would be making financial policy changes.[15]
Responsibilities[edit]

The basic governing principles of the Nationalbank are contained within Article 99 of the Federal Constitution, which deals with matters of monetary policy.[16] There are three numbered factors concerning principles explicitly mentioning the Nationalbank, of four altogether shown within the Article. The SNB is therefore obliged by constitutional statute law to act in accordance with the economic interests of Switzerland,[17] accordingly, the prime function of the Nationalbank is:[18]

to pursue a reliable monetary policy for the benefit of the Swiss economy and the Swiss people.

The Nationalbank publishes within its own site a list of research done as work in progress by staff members, which begin at 2004 (2 papers), to 2005 (2), 2006 (11), 2007 (17), 2008 (19), 2009 (16), 2010 (19), 2011 (14), 2012 (16), 2013 (11), 2014 (13), and to 1 August 2015 there is shown nine papers,[19] a list of eight economic studies which relate to the tasks of the bank, listed from 2005,[20] in addition to a bi-annually published update of research, listed from 2012 to the present.[21]
Cash supply and distribution[edit]
The National Bank is entrusted with the note-issuing privilege. It supplies the economy with banknotes that meet high standards with respect to quality and security. It is also charged by the Confederation with the task of coin distribution.
Cashless payment transactions[edit]
In the field of cashless payment transactions, the National Bank provides services for payments between banks. These are settled in the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) system via sight deposit accounts held with the National Bank.
Investment of currency reserves[edit]
The National Bank manages currency reserves. These engender confidence in the Swiss franc, help to prevent and overcome crises and may be utilized for interventions in the foreign exchange market.
Financial system stability[edit]
The National Bank contributes to the stability of the financial system by acting as an arbiter over monetary policy. Within the context of this task, it analyses sources of risk to the financial system, oversees systemically important payment and securities settlement systems and helps to promote an operational environment for the financial sector.
International monetary cooperation[edit]
Together with the federal authorities, the National Bank participates in international monetary cooperation and provides technical assistance.
Banker to the Confederation[edit]
The National Bank acts as banker to the Swiss Confederation. It processes payments on behalf of the Confederation, issues money market debt register claims and bonds, handles the safekeeping of securities and carries out money market and foreign exchange transactions.
Statistics[edit]
The National Bank compiles statistical data on banks and financial markets, the balance of payments, the international investment position and the Swiss financial accounts.
Monetary policy[edit]
The SNB pursues a monetary policy serving the interests of the country as a whole. It must ensure price stability, while taking due account of economic developments. Monetary policy affects production and prices with a considerable time lag. Consequently, it is based on inflation forecasts rather than current inflation. The SNB’s monetary policy strategy consists of three elements: a definition of price stability (the SNB equates price stability with a rise in the national consumer price index of less than 2% per year), a medium-term conditional inflation forecast, and, at operational level, a target range for a reference interest rate, which is the Libor for three-month investments in Swiss francs.
General Meeting of Shareholders[edit]
The General Meeting of Shareholders is held once a year, as a rule in April. Owing to the SNB’s public mandate, the powers of the Shareholders’ Meeting are not as extensive as in joint-stock companies under private law.
Bank Council[edit]
The Bank Council oversees and controls the conduct of business by the Swiss National Bank and consists of 11 members. Six members, including the President and Vice President, are appointed by the Federal Council, and five by the Shareholders’ Meeting. The Bank Council sets up four committees from its own ranks: an Audit Committee, a Risk Committee, a Remuneration Committee and an Appointment Committee.
A list of the Bank Council members is published on the SNB website (see: http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/snb/bodies/id/snb_bodies_council )
Governing Board[edit]
The Swiss National Bank’s management and executive body is the Governing Board. The Governing Board is responsible in particular for monetary policy, asset management strategy, contributing to the stability of the financial system and international monetary cooperation. The Governing Board consists of 3 members:

Chairman: Thomas Jordan[22]
Vice Chairman: Fritz Zurbrügg [22]
Member: Andréa M. Maechler

Gold reserves[edit]




Switzerland's gold reserves


The SNB manages the official gold reserves of Switzerland, which as of 2008 amount to 1145 tonnes and are valued at 30.5 billion CHF.[23] The gold is believed to be stored in huge vaults beneath the Federal Square (Bundesplatz) to the north of the federal Parliament building in Bern, but the SNB treats the location of the gold reserves as a secret.[23] Independent confirmation of the gold's location was obtained by the Bernese newspaper Der Bund in 2008. It published a photograph of the bullion that a keystone photographer was allowed to take at the SNB premises in Bern in 2001. Der Bund also quoted a retired official of the city's surveying office as saying that the gold vaults take up an area of roughly half the Federal Square and have a depth of dozens of meters, down to the level of the Aar river.[23] The SNB says that the gold reserves are stored in different safe places in Switzerland (70%) and abroad (i.e. Bank of England and Bank of Canada).[24]
From the latter years of the 1990s until sometime during 2005, the Nationalbank transferred from its possession an amount of gold deemed superfluous.[5]
World War II[edit]
See also: World War II
The Swiss National Bank provided 1.2 billion CHF to the Reichsbank, of this, a value of approximately 780 million CHF of the gold given to the Nationalbank was gold which had been looted by the forces of Germany. In addition the Nationalbank also exchanged between 1.2–1.6 billion CHF for gold from the Allied forces.[25] During 20 April 1944, gold from the gold reserves of Italy arrived from Como at the railway station within Chiasso.[26]
There is controversy over the role of the Swiss National Bank in the transfer of Nazi gold during World War II. The SNB was the largest gold distribution centre in continental Europe before the war. A study by the U.S. Department of State in 1997 notes that the Bank, "must have known that some portion of the gold it was receiving from the Reichsbank was looted from occupied countries."[27] This was confirmed by the Swiss Bergier commission in 1998 which concluded that the SNB received US$440 million in gold from Nazi sources,[28] of which US$316 million is estimated to have been looted.[citation needed] The gold from Nazi governship sources was in the form of ingots containing gold looted from Central Banks of Europe and gold from Jewish persons executed within the concentration camps established by the machination of the Nazi regime, which the SNB took without knowing these facts at the time, nor inquiring to any great degree in the process of its transfer into the possession of the SNB, according to a former Archivist of the SNB Robert Vogler.[29]
Reports[edit]
The Nationalbank had profits of $39.3 billion at the close of 2014.[30]
On 31 July 2015, the bank reported a first-half loss of £33 billion.[31]

BERN, Switzerland--The Swiss National Bank on Thursday left its key deposit rate unchanged at -0.75%, as the central bank continues to battle a strong Swiss franc which has weakened consumer prices and poses a threat to the country's export-dependent economy. The central bank also reiterated its longstanding assessment that the Swiss franc is "significantly overvalued" and that it will intervene in currency markets as needed. The decisions on rates and currencies were widely expected by economists. The SNB has for many years warned that the franc is too strong. It tends to strengthen in times of global economic and political unrest as global investors pile into safe Swiss assets and Swiss residents keep their money at home. The euro weakened slightly against the franc after Thursday's decision, falling 0.1% to 1.0881 francs. Write to Brian Blackstone at brian.blackstone@wsj.com

Wall Street isn’t ready for a 1,100-point tumble in the Dow industrials
              
              The U.S. stock market is on such a parabolic march higher that Wall Street investors may have forgotten what a typical daily downturn feels like anymore.

Long-dated Treasury yields see weekly climb 
              
              Long-dated Treasury yields rose for the week as recovering commodity values and strong readings in economic data raised growth and inflation expectations.

S&P 500, Nasdaq finish lower after Amazon disappointment; Dow closes at record
              
              The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both finish slightly lower on Friday for weekly losses as Amazon.com shares slump on disappointing earnings, while the Dow industrials finishes at a record for a weekly gain.              
              
            

4:33 p.m.  Today4:33 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dow industrials just 170 points shy of 22,000 milestone
              
              The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged wrapped up at an all-time closing high Friday, ending the week u 1.2% higher, even as the broader market was weighed by a recent slump in shares of technology companies. But notably, the Dow finds itself just 170 points away from hitting another psychological milestone: 22,000. The Dow last hit 21,000 on March 1, but has advanced in fits and starts over the past five months amid growing doubts about how quickly President Donald Trump can implement pro-growth policies pledged during his campaign for the White House. A late-Friday defeat in passing a bill to revamp the Affordable Care Act, underlines those fears. Still, the blue-chip gauge has enjoyed a relatively steady climb, powered by strong moves in shares of Boeing Co. , which has been a key driver of the price-weighted average in recent weeks and months. Boeing shares have climbed 55% so far this year, making it the best performer in the benchmark. The Dow closed on Friday up 0.2% at a record 21,830, the S&P 500 index , meanwhile, ended down 0.1% at 2,472, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  fell 0.1% at 6,374.              
              
            

4:18 p.m.  Today4:18 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dow ends at record; S&P 500, Nasdaq see weekly fall
              
              The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced modestly on Friday to close at an all-time high, with gains this week fueled by earnings from bellwether companies such as Boeing  and Verizon Communication . The Dow  added 33.76 points, or 0.2%, to 21,830.31 and gained 1.2% over the week. But broader markets slipped on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also posting modest weekly losses. The S&P 500  closed 3.32 points, or 0.1%, lower at 2,472.10, retreating from record levels set on Wednesday. The benchmark index finished the week roughly where it started. The Nasdaq Composite index  declined 7.51 points, or 0.1%, to 6,374.68 and ended the week 0.2% lower. On Friday, sharp post-earnings losses from Amazon.com  weighed on the main indexes.
