Title: 
               Company: Artnet.com AG
Job Details
               artnet AG and artnet Worldwide Corp. (collectively, "the Company") operate under the trade name artnet. artnet provides services to fine-art professionals that improve the economics of their businesses. The art business is international but is conducted locally by tens of thousands of geographically dispersed dealers, galleries, auction houses, print publishers, museums and collectors in a relatively inefficient marketplace. Observing the inefficiencies in the art business, artnet developed its first product, the Price Database, to bring price transparency to the art market. Today the Price Database has a broad base of customers dominated by major auction houses, art dealers, museums and insurance companies. In 1995 the company transitioned the Price Database to the Internet and introduced a second product, the online Gallery Network, building and hosting websites for art dealers and galleries on its platform. The online Gallery Network was supplemented by a new online art trade magazine to draw attention to the site. Today, artnet is a critical tool, providing its member dealers with global market access, significant incremental revenue opportunities and cost-effective marketing solutions during a volatile economic period.

            Sophos Press Release
        


 Chris Doggett, Vice President of Global Channels at Sophos
BOSTON - April 6, 2010 - IT security and data protection firm Sophos today announced that Christopher Doggett, vice president of global channels at Sophos is participating in a panel discussion titled, 'Business Strategies and Differentiators, A First Priority' at CompTIA, one of the leading trade association for the IT industry. The panel, moderated by Larry Walsh, vice president and group publisher at Channel Insider, will take place on Thursday, April 8th from 11:00am - 12:00pm CDT during CompTIA's Annual Member Meeting (AMM) at the Swissotel in Chicago, IL.
Doggett is a respected channel executive with a proven track record and has earned numerous accolades for his channel leadership. Under his guidance, Sophos's channel program has attracted some of the best solution providers. One of the hallmarks of Sophos's business model is that every deal involves a partner. This 100% partner go-to-market approach is an integral component of Sophos's strategy and the company's DNA.
Sophos offers a combination of high-growth, predictable profits, and clear, consistent rewards for each and every investment that a partner makes in building a joint business with Sophos. The formula to Sophos's successful Partner Program is its unyielding commitment to product quality, customer satisfaction and world-class support, which has allowed partners to offer their customers the best security solutions in the industry. Additionally, Sophos offers one of the highest levels of deal protection and margin preservation for partner-originated deals, and importantly, partners encounter the lowest level of channel conflict of any vendor in the industry.
Session Title:
Security Session: 'Business Strategies and Differentiators, A First Priority'
Session Description:
Leaders in the security world delve into what it really means to provide security services and how to determine which resellers are qualified to provide them. Our panel of experts will share proven approaches to vertical and niche markets and provide insights on partnering with other organizations to deliver a larger suite of security services.
Session Panelists:

Christopher Doggett, Vice President, Global Channels, Sophos 
Randy Cochran, Vice President, North American Channel Sales, Symantec Corporation
