Illinois governor urges House not to undo budget plan veto

						 By SOPHIA TAREEN and JOHN O'CONNOR, Associated Press  - Wednesday Jul 5, 2017

 CHICAGO (AP) — Gov. Bruce Rauner implored lawmakers Wednesday not to override his veto of a proposal to end Illinois' unprecedented budget impasse, calling the plan that includes a large income tax increase a "disaster" that will not solve the state's many financial problems.[...] in the long run, it will make our problems worse, not better.The first-term Republican, who has been deadlocked with Democrats controlling the Legislature since taking office in 2015, said he would do "everything possible" to persuade House lawmakers, who are poised to take an override vote Thursday.Rauner, a former venture capitalist whose massive personal wealth has largely funded the state Republican Party, would not elaborate on his tactics.The session was capped by a flurry of activity on Tuesday, when the Senate sent a $36 billion spending plan to the governor funded with a permanent 32 percent income tax increase.Credit-rating houses have threatened to downgrade the state's creditworthiness to "junk," signaling to investors that buying state debt is a highly speculative venture.[...] it's been reinforced, Andersson said, referring to a decision by some credit-rating agencies to hold off on any more downgrades while the Legislature was still at work.Rauner has sought pro-business reforms in conjunction with a budget, including a property tax freeze and term limits, and blames the state's failures on Democrats in power, largely Madigan.

Re:   Realmark Property Investors Limited Partnership V                         
(Commission File #:0-16561)                                         

We  have  read  Item  4 of  Form  8-K of  Realmark  Property  Investors  Limited
Partnership  V (the  "Company")  dated  January 19, 2000 and have the  following
comments:                                                                       

1.    We agree with the statements made in the first paragraph,  except that the
      date of our  resignation  was January 11, 2000, not January 11, 1999. With
      respect to our "withdrawal  letter", our letter was the standard AICPA SEC
      Practice  Section  Notification  Letter  confirming  the  cessation of the
      client-auditor relationship, a copy of which was provided to the Office of
the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission.     

2.    We agree with the  statements  made in the second  paragraph.  However,  a
      reader  might  infer  from the  reference  to the  audit of the  Company's
      financial  statements  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 that we
      would perform this audit.  This is not the case,  given our resignation as
auditors.                                                           

3.    We agree with the statements made in the third paragraph.                 

4.    We agree with the statements made in the fourth paragraph, however, we    
 believe that the statements made regarding the "Draft Letter" require
clarification.  The document referred to as the "Draft Letter" is a 
draft of our report dated April 30, 1999 that communicates certain  
  matters considered to be material weaknesses in the Company's internal
   controls as well certain other observations regarding internal controls
and other matters relating to the Company.  On May 25, 1999, we     
provided a copy of the draft report to Company representatives and  
 reviewed the draft report with the representatives at that time.  The
draft report was not finalized and issued, and, in light of our     
resignation as auditors, will not be finalized and issued.

5.    We agree with the statements made in the fifth paragraph,  except that the
      following  material  weaknesses  in  internal  controls  related  to other
      Realmark   Partnerships  and  were  not  pertinent  to  Realmark  Property
Investors Limited Partnership V:                                    

   o     inadequate support for certain construction account disbursements
      o     inadequate provisions for the maintenance of a separate property and
joint venture account.                                  

6.    We have no basis for agreeing or disagreeing  with the statements  made in
      the sixth paragraph,  however, we wish to refer the reader to our response
to paragraph four above regarding our draft report.                 

7.    We agree with the statements made in the seventh paragraph.               

8.    We have no basis for agreeing or disagreeing with the statements made     
in the eighth paragraph.                                            

9.    We agree with the statements made in the ninth paragraph.                 

Very truly yours,

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

Six months
ended June 30, 2011 and 2010

(Unaudited)

 

Organization

 

Realmark
Property Investors Limited Partnership - V (the Partnership), a
Delaware limited partnership, was formed on February 28, 1986, to
invest in a diversified portfolio of income-producing real estate
investments. The general partners are Realmark Properties, Inc.
(the corporate general partner) and Joseph M. Jayson (the
individual general partner). Joseph M. Jayson is the sole
shareholder of J.M. Jayson & Company, Inc. Realmark Properties,
Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of J.M. Jayson & Company,
Inc.  Under the partnership agreement, the general
partners and their affiliates can receive compensation for services
rendered and reimbursement for expenses incurred on behalf of the
Partnership.

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and the
instructions to Form 10-Q.  Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and notes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
complete financial statements. The balance sheet at December 31,
2010 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that
date. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair
presentation, have been included. The Partnership’s
significant accounting policies are set forth in its December 31,
2010 Form 10-K. The interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included therein. The
interim results should not be considered indicative of the annual
results.

 

Property
and Equipment

 

Two of the
three buildings of the office complex known as Commercial Park West
in Durham, North Carolina were sold in December
2006.  The mortgage on the buildings was paid off in the
amount of $5,606,725 at the closing date with the sales proceeds
and an advance from an affiliate in the amount of
$790,000.  At June 30, 2011, the Partnership owned and
operated the one remaining building at the complex known as
Commercial Park West.

 

 

PART I -
Item 2.     Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

As a
result of the operating loss at Commercial Park West, the
Partnership relied on cash advances from affiliates of the general
partner to fund operations during the first six months of 2011. In
accordance with the settlement of the lawsuit (Part II, Item 1), it
is anticipated that with the sale of the remaining property, the
Partnership may be in a position to make distributions to the
limited partners.

Results of
Operations

 

As
compared to the same three and six month periods of 2010, the
Partnership’s loss increased approximately $10,000 and
$28,000 from a loss of $124,000 and $196,000 in 2010 to a loss of
$114,000 and $224,000 in 2011.

 

As
compared to the same three and six months periods in 2010, rental
income at Commercial Park West decreased approximately $34,000 and
