ClubCorp's stock rockets after $1.1 billion buyout deal with Apollo Global
Shares of ClubCorp Holdings Inc.  rocketed 31% toward a 4-month high in active premarket trade Monday, after the golf and country clubs owner and operator announced over the weekend a deal to be acquired for $1.1 billion by private-equity firm Apollo Global Management. Under terms of the deal, Apollo will pay $17.12 in cash for each ClubCorp share outstanding, which is 31% above Friday's closing price of $13.10. "With the support of the Apollo funds, we are confident that ClubCorp will be able to continue building on its success by providing its members with unrivaled experiences at its clubs," said ClubCorp Chairman John Beckert. "This transaction represents the culmination of our review of strategic alternatives and achieves our goal of enhancing value for shareholders." Trading volume topped 1.8 million shares more than 30 minutes before the open, which is already nearly 4 times the full-day average, and enough to make the stock the most actively traded in the premarket. The stock had tumbled 15% year to date through Friday, while the S&P 500  has gained 2.9%.

CLUBCORP HOLDINGS, INC. (NYSE:MYCC)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



NEW YORK, July 13, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of ClubCorp Holdings, Inc. ("MYCC" or the "Company") (NYSE: MYCC) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (the "Affiliates").  Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $17.12 in cash for each MYCC share they own.
WeissLaw is investigating whether MYCC's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.  Notably, the offer price is nearly $10.00 less than the analyst target price of $27.00.  Additionally, MYCC recently announced its twelfth consecutive quarter of growth; reporting revenue of $221.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $6.4 million when compared to the $214.9 million reported in the same period of the previous year.  
Given these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether MYCC's Board acted in the best interests of MYCC's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.  If you own MYCC shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com.   
WeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.  We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases.  If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/clubcorp-holdings-inc/.

WeissLaw is investigating whether MYCC's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.  Notably, the offer price is nearly $10.00 less than the analyst target price of $27.00.  Additionally, MYCC recently announced its twelfth consecutive quarter of growth; reporting revenue of $221.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $6.4 million when compared to the $214.9 million reported in the same period of the previous year.  
Given these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether MYCC's Board acted in the best interests of MYCC's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.  If you own MYCC shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com.   
WeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.  We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases.  If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/clubcorp-holdings-inc/.

ClubCorp's stock rockets after $1.1 billion buyout deal with Apollo Global
Shares of ClubCorp Holdings Inc.  rocketed 31% toward a 4-month high in active premarket trade Monday, after the golf and country clubs owner and operator announced over the weekend a deal to be acquired for $1.1 billion by private-equity firm Apollo Global Management. Under terms of the deal, Apollo will pay $17.12 in cash for each ClubCorp share outstanding, which is 31% above Friday's closing price of $13.10. "With the support of the Apollo funds, we are confident that ClubCorp will be able to continue building on its success by providing its members with unrivaled experiences at its clubs," said ClubCorp Chairman John Beckert. "This transaction represents the culmination of our review of strategic alternatives and achieves our goal of enhancing value for shareholders." Trading volume topped 1.8 million shares more than 30 minutes before the open, which is already nearly 4 times the full-day average, and enough to make the stock the most actively traded in the premarket. The stock had tumbled 15% year to date through Friday, while the S&P 500  has gained 2.9%.

Interesting MYCC Put And Call Options For December 15th
Investors in ClubCorp Holdings Inc saw new options become available this week, for the December 15th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 165 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

ClubCorp Holdings (MYCC) Passes Through 4% Yield Mark
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, in trading on Tuesday, shares of ClubCorp Holdings Inc were yielding above the 4% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $0.52), with the stock changing hands as low as $12.95 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return.

ClubCorp And FrontFour Capital Reach Agreement To Add Two New Independent Directors To Board Of Directors
Simon M. Turner and Manny Pearlman Appointed to Board Effective Immediately

May 12, 2017 5:10 PM EDT









ClubCorp Holdings is Oversold
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. ClubCorp Holdings Inc presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

May 11, 2017 3:58 PM EDT









YieldBoost ClubCorp Holdings To 14.2% Using Options
Shareholders of ClubCorp Holdings Inc looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 4% annualized dividend yield can sell the December covered call at the $14 strike and collect the premium based on the 80 cents bid, which annualizes to an additional 10.2% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 14.2% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $14 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MYCC shares would have to climb 7.4% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 13.6% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
