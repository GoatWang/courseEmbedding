The energy market has shifted, ushering in an era where so-called  wastes are being re-examined, and the desire for energy security and  clean/green energy sources is rising. Rudd Asset Management (RAM), an energy  consulting company specializing in cost-effective solutions, recently helped a  large horse racing and competition complex that wanted to develop “green”  policies that made economic sense. By using Palisade DecisionTools Suite, RAM  determined that converting stall bedding and manure waste into renewable energy  was a feasible, cost-effective solution—helping the complex turn a  waste-disposal problem into a profit. 
 
Background
RAM often works with companies looking to add renewable power  sources. More and more industries are  interested in reliable and renewable energy sources, creating a vastly  different energy market than the one we had just a few years ago. The  uncertainty of all energy production-related variables can make investment highly  challenging. As-developing countries” grow their economies, the necessity for  clean, safe, affordable power becomes critical. While renewable energies can  open up promising opportunities--what once was a disposal problem can sometimes  become an energy advantage—their costs and aggregate risks remain unknown.
 RAM worked on a recent project that posed these important  questions.  The client was a large horse  racing and competition complex that wanted a “green” image. While the  environmentally-friendly image was important to them, it also had to make  economic sense. 
 Further constraining their budget was ever-rising costs for disposal of  stall bedding and manure and steadily increasing energy bills. The opportunity  to avoid the costs to transport and dispose of the waste became an opportunity  for free fuel or even “negative cost fuel” for the project. 
 The opportunity to create a win-win scenario and accomplish this  conversion of waste to energy in a “green” way made it even more enticing. But,  did it make economic sense?  With only a few  constants and almost everything a variable, RAM decided to apply risk  management and Monte Carlo simulation.
Considering All Uncertainties
To begin with, RAM did a review of gasification of waste materials from  a number of nearby tracks. The ultimate goal was simple: get a win-win by  changing a negative to a positive. Convert an increasing waste expense to a sustainable  source of “green” renewable energy. 
 Unsurprisingly, the uncertainties were numerous. Variables that had to  be considered included: cost to gasify the “fuel”; the cost to aggregate the  multiple fuel supplies; the cost to generate the power; the value of combined  heat and power thermal energy; the quantity of fuel available each year, the  energy used by the facilities each year; and the alternative costs to purchase  the power from the local utility. RAM opted to use the Palisade DecisionTools  Suite for the analysis. Energy use of the facility for the last 5 years was  reviewed to get an energy use range. Then, an estimate of the future energy consumption  was made to get an electric power and thermal energy use range to be modeled  into @RISK. Similar estimates for the variance for amount of waste (tons); energy  content of the fuels; the cost to manage the fuel; and the wholesale value for  sale of excess energy was also modeled. All these variables had to be  considered in addition to the capital costs for the new power plant, operations  and maintenance costs, and funding costs of the project.
Focusing On Value Drivers
Typically, unless there is enough history to know variables and their variance,  RAM starts with a triangular distribution. Assumptions are reviewed with the client  or other available experts to ensure the client approves of the goals.  This initial process is iterative, and  assumptions are refined later. Once RAM collaborates with the clients, they  improve the assumptions by looking at what variables drive value. 
 In this case, initial results for project Net Present Value showed that  the outcome was most affected by the price of wholesale power. The affect to  NPV from the expected variance in engine gross generation and the paid disposal  fee was small. Knowing that was the key value driver, we were able to focus on  our assumptions for the price of wholesale power. The use of @RISK’s tornado  diagram is an effective aid in focusing on the value drivers.
 



Another useful tool RAM used to guide the project is the probability  distribution chart.  Examining the  predicted NPV, we saw that this project shows an expected NPV of nearly $ 1.2  million dollars within 5 years, with a 94% probability of a positive NPV. This  amounted to an 18% IRR and debt coverage ratio of over 3.6, an excellent result  considering the total investment was under $ 9.2 million. 
 



Refining the Model
Once a project has been screened to see if it makes financial sense, RAM  then switches its focus towards improving their model assumptions. During this  stage, RAM, consults the other stakeholders of the project and looks at the  results. 
 In this case, because the simulation determined that the wholesale  power price drove the value, RAM next needed to confirm that the price was  truly accurate.   By focusing on variables with the most impact,  RAM was able to  do a review in a lot  less time, while getting better accuracy.
The general format of the spreadsheet that RAM used for this project is  shown below. The simulation results show the project is feasible:

Internal Rate of Return> 15 %
Debt Coverage Ratio> 2
Net Present Value positive within 5 years
Strong and growing after tax cash flows

Thus, with RAM’s methodology of taking a project, starting with simple proactive assumptions, getting buy-in from all stakeholders, looking at the results, refining the assumptions, and iterating where necessary, a model is developed that allows accurate decision-making.  According to Mark Rudd, RAM President, “Palisade DecisionTools software is a great tool for our process. We help the client make better decisions, quicker using the power of Monte Carlo simulation and useful statistics.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
