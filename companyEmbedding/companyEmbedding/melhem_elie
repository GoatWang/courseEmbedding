Our HistoryEMC - Elie Melhem Clinics (2014) was initially known as Elie Melhem Center during the time it was established in Jounieh (Lebanon) in 1998. EMC relocated to Levant hospital (Sin-El-Fil) in 2007.

After years of experience, Elie Melhem (Owner & CEO) decided to bring to town the most advanced top of the line machines around the world. This ambitious drive to give the client the best led to the launching of the new EMC - Elie Melhem Clinics in January 2014 in a beautiful & luxurious location right next to Hilton Hotel.
