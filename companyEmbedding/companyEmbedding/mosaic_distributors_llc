                About Mosaic
              

After marinating some beef tenderloin with galangal herb, chef Richard Yu finishes off the succulent cut with a sweet-and-spicy cambogee sauce. This signature dish is emblematic of the China-born cook's creative work at Mosaic, where his Asian-fusion and American meals stand out with locally grown produce, hand-cut meats, and fresh seafood. He also puts his unique stamp on other classic Eastern and Western dishes, such as his orange chicken with sun-dried mandarin-orange peels and his 8-ounce salmon stuffed with crab, shrimp, and cheese.
To complement Chef Richard's cuisine, bartenders craft a variety of hand-shaken cocktails such as Mosaic's signature Mosaic-Tini, a blend of muddled strawberries, simple syrup, and organic riesling. Many of those cocktails come spiked with house-infused vodkas, and other imported liquors also stock the bar alongside wines and domestic and imported beers.
Meals unfold on Mosaic's outdoor plaza or in its chic lounge inside the historic Four Points by Sheraton San Jose Downtown hotel, which affords stunning views and often hosts late-night entertainment. A nightclub sets up residency Thursday–Saturday nights, and jazz musicians improvise their way through tunes in the dining room each Friday and Saturday.

Groupon Goods for All Your Online Shopping
Groupon is all about helping you find new experiences, and that extends to online shopping. Our collection of consumer goods is always expanding with new items to enrich your ever-changing life, whether it’s athletic apparel to wear on that upcoming 5K or cell phone accessories to outfit your newest gadget. Welcome to Groupon Goods, your source for deals on everything from cookware to pet sweaters.
Make Home Life Easier
Keeping up a household is hard work, but Groupon carries all the items you need to maintain a full, happy home. That starts with transforming every space into an extension of yourself—a task to which our For the Home section is well suited, thanks to online deals on new bedding that suits your style or outdoor furniture to turn your patio into a second living room. To keep your family happy, Groceries & Pets stocks your pantry with items such as extra coffee pods—or bulk wine, which seems to run out just as fast—as well as toys for your loyal critters. Keeping up with the kids is a race you might never win, but at least you can stay apace as kids grow. (When they’re newborns, baby care essentials keep them safe; when they’re toddlers, toys keep parents sane.) Of course, maintaining a home or car sometimes requires a little maintenance, too, in which case keep chaos at bay with a range of home improvement supplies, including major appliances.
Stay on Trend
Online shopping isn’t just for keeping up with your busy life, though—it’s also to enrich your lifestyle. Groupon keeps up with the latest trends, adding new deals every day to a selection of clothing for both men and women. Women's Fashion comprises everything from handbags to bras, whereas Men's Fashion covers both casual and business apparel. Likewise, much of our jewelry sport unisex designs—though different shoppers may have very different motives for browsing diamond jewelry . Both men’s and women’s fragrances waft through the Health & Beauty section, along with an ever-changing variety of cosmetics, haircare, skincare, and personal hygiene products.
Play Hard
No online store is complete without a reason to have fun, so Groupon gives you plenty of ways to occupy your free time. Gadgets galore fill the Electronics section, where the virtual aisles overflow with cell phones and accessories, computers and tablets, and home theater equipment. But even the biggest HDTV is nothing without entertainment to play on it,such as movies, video games, and music—though if you’re more into books and magazines, you’ll find plenty of titles from which to choose. Not all leisure time is spent on the couch, though. Sporting goods keep you active in the Great Outdoors, outfitting you with new clubs for the golf course or plenty of provisions for a camping trip in the woods. And if it’s raining out, spend a couple happy hours adding to your collection of sports cards, commemorative coins, or other collectibles.

Powder Diffraction



Products - Powder DiffractionThe very reliable, high-precision two circle goniometer is the basis of a whole range of x-ray powder diffraction solutions. Vertically or horizontally mounted, the STADI P can be built-up in Transmission/Debye-Scherrer or Bragg-Brentano geometry: Transmission/Debye-Scherrer, Reflection/ Bragg-Brentano or both. Two STADI P goniometers, either in the same or different configurations, can be mounted in the same cabinet resulting in two completely independent units. Moreover, two goniometers can share one source.WHY MEASURE POWDER IN TRANSMISSION- / DEBYE-SCHERRER GEOMETRY?Stadi MPStadi P combiStadi PAccessoriesSoftwareLabnotes

News & Events



NewsAdvanced Light
Source selects STOE STADIVARI diffractometer – the most precise four circle
XRD- for single crystal high pressure research.
STOE and Mosaic Distribution are proud
to announce the installation of the first STOE STADIVARI in vertical set-up on
the High-Pressure Beamline 12.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley,
California.
Beamline
12.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source is a Synchrotron-based Hard X-ray
Diffraction beamline specifically aimed at samples under high pressure within
diamond anvil cells. The beamline photon energy range is 6-35keV with an x-ray
spot size down to 10 x 10 μm.  This research plays an
important role in the fields of Earth sciences, materials science, construction
materials, chemistry and energy and is funded by the DOE (Department of Energy)
and COMPRES (the Consortium for Materials Properties Research in Earth
Sciences).  
The
STOE STADIVARI was selected by Dr. Christine Beavers for 12.2.2 due to its
ability to easily mount the heavy high pressure cells (up to 2 kg) and yet
maintain its high precision and accuracy. The STOE STADIVARI four circle XRDs have
a sphere of confusion of less than 10 µm in diameter / 5 µm in radius (the most
precise instrument in the industry). In addition, STOE’s powerful user-friendly
software makes high quality data acquisition and analysis remarkably fast.  
Dr.
Christine Beavers, COMPRES staff at the ALS commented, "We are very
excited to be able to offer our users a premiere facility for single crystal
high pressure diffraction. The STADIVARI will allow our users to collect many
more of the accessible reflections, while maintaining small samples on the
center of rotation. We are also very happy to have the Mosaic & STOE teams
supporting us; at the ALS, we are very demanding in our pursuit of cutting edge
instrumentation and  in this case our
expectations have been exceeded."
Jens
Richter, Co-CEO & CTO of STOE commented: “We are happy to have installed
the first STADIVARI system in vertical setup on a place like this, where
cutting-edge science is done. We are expecting a lot of new ideas and demands,
which will help us to improve our hard- and software. Being a focused company,
which have all the R&D and production in house enables us to react quickly
to user demands and keep us at top of the line with our devices. We are looking
forward to a future cooperation with the people from 12.2.2, which will be
beneficial for both the ALS and STOE. “
Liz
Carter, President of Mosaic Distribution commented, “We are thrilled to have the
STADIVARI installed on Christine’s beamline. 
We couldn’t ask for a better ambassador and having the system installed
in such a demanding and high-profile environment will be a good way to
demonstrate the robustness and quality of the system and our ability to support
it.”Picture: Dr. Christine Beavers of Lawrance

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

                About Mosaic
              

After marinating some beef tenderloin with galangal herb, chef Richard Yu finishes off the succulent cut with a sweet-and-spicy cambogee sauce. This signature dish is emblematic of the China-born cook's creative work at Mosaic, where his Asian-fusion and American meals stand out with locally grown produce, hand-cut meats, and fresh seafood. He also puts his unique stamp on other classic Eastern and Western dishes, such as his orange chicken with sun-dried mandarin-orange peels and his 8-ounce salmon stuffed with crab, shrimp, and cheese.
To complement Chef Richard's cuisine, bartenders craft a variety of hand-shaken cocktails such as Mosaic's signature Mosaic-Tini, a blend of muddled strawberries, simple syrup, and organic riesling. Many of those cocktails come spiked with house-infused vodkas, and other imported liquors also stock the bar alongside wines and domestic and imported beers.
Meals unfold on Mosaic's outdoor plaza or in its chic lounge inside the historic Four Points by Sheraton San Jose Downtown hotel, which affords stunning views and often hosts late-night entertainment. A nightclub sets up residency Thursday–Saturday nights, and jazz musicians improvise their way through tunes in the dining room each Friday and Saturday.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
