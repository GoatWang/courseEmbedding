 Gold Resource (NYSEMKT:GORO) mines in Oaxaca, Mexico. Investment Thesis: Ancient Greeks use to say: "The best perfumes stay in small bottles'' and I find this saying particularly fit for gold and silver mining. The bigger the miner, the more complicated it is to follow as an investor.  I really enjoy being able to grasp the entire production of precious metal in a quick analysis based on a simple balance sheet, with a clear outlook and midterm potentials and, above all, no debt. Yes, of course, it is not as simple as it seems and this situation is often hiding some serious weaknesses that need to be seriously evaluated, before being entirely comfortable in committing cash for the long-term.  By limiting precious metal production to a low number of mines, the situation presents a higher concentrated risk that can be lethal in some circumstances, if there is no prospects already available at an advanced stage of completion. I believe, Gold Resource presents the basics needed to grow steadily in the next couple of years and more, hence, GORO is a serious opportunity at or below $4. Recent news: On July 17, 2017, Gold Resource reported its preliminary production numbers for 2Q'17. COLORADO SPRINGS – July 17, 2017 – Gold Resource Corporation (NYSE MKT: GORO) (the “Company”) reports preliminary production results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017 of approximately 5,696 ounces of gold, 397,670 ounces of silver and significant base metals. Gold Resource Corporation is a gold and silver producer, developer and explorer with operations in Oaxaca, Mexico and Nevada, USA. 
 Based on the same ratio as 1Q'17, 397,670 Oz of Silver represent 5,660 Oz Gold Eq. (Ratio 70.3:1) Let's look at this quarterly production from a long-term perspective starting Q1'15. 

A few remarks about the preliminary production numbers for 2Q'17. 1 - Production 2Q'17 will be about 11,356 Oz Au Eq., down 11.5% quarter over quarter. 2 - The Company maintains its 2017 Annual Outlook of 27,500 gold ounces and 1,850,000 silver ounces, plus or minus 5%. Which is about 53,800 Oz Au Eq. 3 - Gold Resource is in the process of expanding production with its Arista Mine’s Switchback vein system. This is an exciting development that will extend the life of the mine and increase production when completed (scheduled at the end of 2017 or first quarter 2018). On June 28, 2017, the company indicated: ... These new drill results extend the known mineralization at Switchback to the southeast by approximately 50 meters on strike and elevation, intercepting multiple veins including 2.33 meters of 6.16 grams per tonne (g/t) gold, 453 g/t silver and 9.29% zinc, within a wider intercept of 5.08 meters of 3.20 g/t gold and 261 g/t silver and 11.85% zinc. The Switchback system’s total strike length now exceeds 625 meters and remains open in all directions. M. Barry Devlin said: The continued high-grade polymetallic mineralization within multiple parallel veins at Switchback leads us to believe the Arista Mine is much larger than has been defined to date. Exploration plans for the Switchback vein system for the remainder of 2017 include infill drilling within the known mineralized horizon, as well as testing the northwestern strike extension of this growing epithermal vein system. 4 - Gold is about $1,259/ Oz for the 2Q'17 compared to $1,215 / Oz in the 1Q'17, up 3.6% quarter over quarter. Silver is about $17.19/ Oz compared to $17.29 / Oz in 1Q'17 nearly the same as the last quarter.
 

 

 Future potential with Properties in Nevada: The Isabella Pearl Project. The real positive that may eventually trigger a solid boost to the stock price in 2018 and an increase in dividends as well, is the company Nevada mining unit, without any doubt. On January 11, 2017, The company acquired 100% of 153 mining claims from Nevada Select for $460k. The newly acquired mining claims brings the total number of mining claims at the Its Isabella Pearl Project to 494, covering approximately 9,000 acres. The company intends to put the Isabella Pearl into production in the near term, and an increase of the company's total production by 100%. The Isabella Pearl should return more positive cash flow than Arista because it is an open pit heap leach shallow, with consequently a lower AISC.  The initial CapEx estimated to be about $25-$30 million, will not allow a financing with cash flow only, and the company will have to finance it either through equity or short term debt. This is a potential negative for shareholders in the short term, especially if the company finance the project with equity. Gold Resource owns also two other properties in the area.  Gold Mesa Mina Gold  Conclusion: GORO mid term outlook is very positive with the prolific Switchback extension nearly completed, the Alta Gracia property nearby, and the Isabella Pearl project that could double the company production in 2018 while lowering the total AISC.
 

 I believe GORO should be accumulated now and below $4 (which is a long term support). Price of gold and silver -- which are strong lately due to weakness of the $US dollar -- are of a paramount significance and should be analyzed first before considering a long-term accumulation. Important note: Do not forget to follow me on the gold sector. Thank you for your support.

Gold Resource Corp.: A Comprehensive Update - Gold Resource Corporation (NYSEMKT:GORO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Gold Resource Corp.: A Comprehensive UpdateJul.10.17 | About: Gold Resource (GORO) Amit Ghate Long/short equity, valueSummaryGORO continues to make substantial progress on both the operational and exploration fronts.Infill and stepout drilling at Switchback have been particularly encouraging.The company is also progressing its Nevada Mining Unit, but financing this development may put the company's sterling financials at risk. I will be monitoring this.Based on the Switchback results, I increase my two-year target price to a range of $12 to $15.I have followed - and written about - Gold Resource Corp. (GORO) for a long time now, including disclosing my investment and shorter term trading ideas. Today, not only do I want to update these theses and discuss an aspect of the company that I've hitherto been silent on but I'd also like to take a step back and present my thoughts regarding the overall operation of the company as I feel that GORO is approaching an important fork in its potential development. Let's begin by exploring this last point first. Background and Bigger Picture I originally (circa 2011 or 2012) came upon GORO as a short pick due to valuation and a worsening precious metals pricing environment. The short actually worked out well, but over time following the company, I began to appreciate several strengths the company displayed relative to its small-cap precious metals mining peers. First, it didn't bite off more than it could chew, e.g. rather than lay out grandiose mine plans that would cost 100s of millions of dollars in capital costs and years of development time, the company instead tried to maximize early cash flow and minimize capital expenditures by adopting a much more modest and direct mining plan. The results, in my view, have been very positive as not only has GORO been profitable and returned cash to shareholders via dividends but more importantly, the company has kept share dilution to a minimum and has remained debt free. I'll return to this point in a second, but let me also mention that the progress of development has been gradual but continuously positive. The company started by going after the low hanging fruit of the Aguila open pit mine it then transitioned to the underground mine of the Arista and Baja veins. While developing this commercial mine, GORO used a portion of the cash proceeds to drill other areas of the El Aguila property as well as neighbouring properties under its control.
 In so doing, not only could the company begin returning cash to investors, it was also able to ready the Alta Gracia property for small scale production and, more notably, has been able to develop a new vein system - the Switchback - adjacent to the Arista mine such that it now rivals the original underground mine in reserves and prospects. Moreover, with ongoing cash flow from Arista reducing the need for rapid production out of Switchback, GORO has been able to take a more measured development track on the Switchback, such that it will have more options open to it should mining run into water or gas incursion. In sum then, GORO has been able to maintain or increase reserves annually, has increased mill throughput and will imminently be using the as-yet-unused agitated leach circuit to process Alta Gracia ore and, by next year, will have three mines in production which will afford its increasing operational flexibility. That this has all been done without substantially increasing the share count since 2011 or without incurring any long-term debt is a critical component of the company's success. 

GORO Shares Outstanding data by YCharts Now, this may not seem like much of a feat, but anyone familiar with the small-cap precious metals space knows the very substantial share dilution that occurs with almost every new project. Of course, some might argue that the development path GORO chose was sub-optimal, since some MBA could likely create a discounted cash flow spreadsheet which produces a theoretical calculation that results in a much higher present value than does the course that GORO pursued. Such a spreadsheet would involve large initial capital expenditures and a long delay in initial operation, but everything would come out positive in the end when the cash flows finally materialized.
 I personally believe, however, that GORO's path was one of its principal strengths, and by not incurring debt or large financings, it has been able to much more readily weather a weak precious metals market and the not unusual problems it has experienced in its mine development process. Had the company faced interest payments when any problems or delays arose, it would likely have resulted in large dilution at a time when the stock price would be at a low point. I bring all this up, not only because it is a big positive factor for me in my evaluation of the company but more importantly because the company will soon face financing decisions for its new Nevada Mining Unit, and I fear that dilution and/or debt financing will put the company's sterling financial condition at risk. I discuss the Nevada unit below, but this financing concern is one I'll be monitoring and is easier to understand in light of the company's history rather than just due to the facts about reserves and potential cash flows from the Nevada properties themselves. With that said, let's now turn to the recent developments at the Switchback and Nevada Units. Switchback Drill Results During 2017, GORO has announced very important and encouraging drill results from the Switchback, including both infill and deposit-extending results. The three tables below summarize the results and include my metric of value/tonne X intercept length as a proxy for the importance of any given drill result. The first table is a reprisal of one previously shown in my February article, but using July metals prices, the second shows recent infill results, and the third shows an exciting extension to the Switchback vein system. Results highlighted in yellow are grades that are at least double those of the EOY 2016 proven and probable reserves for Switchback. 


 

 

 The infill drill results are important because - when they're positive as in the case here - they can prove vein/deposit continuity which in turn helps convert mineralized and indicated resource numbers into proven and probable values. In a previous article, I'd shown a detailed calculation valuing GORO at $10.21 per share. You can review the calculation here, but suffice it to say that there were 203,500 tonnes of P&P reserves at Switchback which I valued at $31.2M using a processing cost of $100/tonne, while the less certain M&I reserves of 959,000 tonnes were valued using a higher processing cost of $125/tonne yielding a total value of $133.8M. The infill results should move a good fraction of the M&I resource into the P&P category and will likely increase the grades slightly, the combination of which will lead to a substantial bump-up in reserve valuation. Moreover, proving continuity will make mine-planning at Switchback that much easier, and I expect initial production to begin by late 2017 and to be going at full bore by the start of 2018. I likewise expect continuous profitability and substantial cash flows from the three mines from 2018 and subsequently. However, as important as the infill drill results are, even more important is that in 2017, the company has expanded the Switchback deposit both to the NW and to the SE. I'd previously discussed the NW stepout which had some pretty exciting drill holes in January/February of this year (see first table above and graphic below), and these were further confirmed by the high gold grades in hole 516153 in the second table and second graphic below. I believe that the NW stepouts and infills will boost EOY 2017 M&I resources at the Switchback on the order of 15% to 20%.
 

 

 Following the NW expansion, the company has now also expanded the deposit to the SE with some high-grade intercepts (see third table above). Drill holes 517106 and 517108 which each intersected long intervals of the Soledad vein are particularly encouraging as their angular spacing suggests a thick vein for a minimum vertical height of 37m and probably substantially more, given that 517107 also intercepted the vein (though with a shorter interval). It's also noteworthy that the Switchback is a true polymetallic deposit, getting approximately equal value from its five component metals. (At July 1 metal prices, the 2016 Switchback $323 value per tonne is broken down as follows: $84 in gold, $50 in silver, $30 in copper, $39 in lead, and $121 in zinc.) This means that the operating results won't be tied to precious metals prices alone; the base metals are of equal importance and may help to provide some price stability. 

 By the time next year's reserve calculations are out, I believe that these stepout and infill drill results will increase the in-ground value of the deposit by several hundreds of millions of dollars, which could add anywhere from $2 to $5 to my price target (i.e. increasing my PT to $12-15 per share).
 Nevada Mining Unit As of yet, I haven't discussed the company's relatively new Nevada Mining Unit because the properties are prospective, i.e. not yet in production or even having a production decision made. However, the company's management is very high on the potential of these properties, so it's worth looking at them in a bit of detail. The unit consists of four properties with Isabella Pearl having P&P reserves and being close to a production decision. Note also that the East Camp Douglas project was acquired in 2017, so won't have new drill results in the near future. (The following graphics are taken from the current investors' presentation) : 

 Isabella Pearl is near production and will have the following characteristics: 

 

 With an additional $30M (but let's say $40M as these projects always go over initial estimates) to bring Isabella Pearl into production, GORO believes it can double gold production and then meaningfully increase the dividend. Here's a comment on this prospect from the most recent earning's call with my emphasis. But I want to increase our gold production by 100%. So again, it's one of these things where it's on the shorter term sure, we could increase the dividend, but then it hurts us putting this Isabella Pearl into production. And I have said this I think in the K conference call that the variables are obviously production, metal prices and development are the big variables with development being Isabella Pearl. And so if metal prices shot through the roof and there is a lot of x-factors that could perhaps do that, I don't - I am not really counting on that. But if it did and we can build Isabella Pearl with cash flow and increase the dividend, we will do that. But yes, we just - too many variables right now. I don't expect the dividend to move this year. Let's wait and see, once we get Isabella Pearl into production, we have 100% increase. We will probably make more money at Isabella Pearl per year than we do in Mexico, just because it's an open pit heap leach shallow. I mean the costs are just not going be there every year, but the revenue is going to be there. So I think we will really be able to increase the dividend once Isabella Pearl comes online.
 The other two properties continue to have positive drill results in 2017, with this coming from Gold Mesa in March, this from Mina Gold in March, and this from Gold Mesa in June. In my view, the Nevada Mining Unit is an exciting prospect, which could be the next leg in the company's development particularly if one property can be used to finance the next, etc. However, as I discussed at length above, I would much prefer that the company proceed with a more gradual plan which would allow it to self-finance Isabella Pearl, rather than turning to debt and/or equity markets. In my opinion, GORO should continue assembling all necessary permitting and then come up with a mine plan, but should then wait until the Switchback and Alta Gracia mines are in full production and all commissioning/start up issues have been resolved such that they are producing full cash flows before making any meaningful capital expenditures at Isabella Pearl. (Having all permits and a mine plan in hand would also allow the company to accelerate production IF there were a meaningful spike in gold prices, but absent such a spike, there should be no reason to over-extend the company's finances.) I will be watching to see what the company decides to do with the Nevada Unit, and I know that the company is wrestling with the financing issue as noted in this quote also from the last earning's call (my emphasis):    Jason Reid We are putting a lot of the cash from the company to work in Nevada already by acquiring properties, we are paying cash and equity shares, we are drilling, we drilled a $600,000 plus water well. There is all sorts of engineering costs. There is all sorts of costs that we are already incurring that are in these numbers in Nevada already. So we will continue to put cash towards it. It's just - as we publicly stated, we are still working on the exact amount, but $25 million, $30 million, more or less CapEx on this, we can't take our balance to zero, so. Unidentified Analyst Of course not. Jason Reid So I mean it's going to be tough to do this all with cash flow. The question is, can we bootstrap it and do it with payments along the way or do we have to look at alternatives, so everything - those all three are all on the table cash, equity, debt or a combination of those to get the Isabella Pearl. But we need to do both, because that will be a huge driver. If were in Switchback in 2018, bulk tonnage mining that and we have Isabella Pearl come online, we are going to be a completely different company. 
 Conclusion GORO has been making substantial progress in both operations and exploration. I expect that the company will continue to operate profitably in 2017 based on exploitation of the Arista mine. It will also bring the smaller Alta Gracia property into steady state production during the year. In 2018, Switchback will enter production and meaningfully increase cash flows. Moreover, P&P reserves for the company will grow by 30+% due to this year's exciting Switchback infill and stepout drill results. I am increasing my two-year price target from $10 per share to $12 to $15 share based on these forecasts. I'm also watching the development of the Nevada Mining Unit as it could be a further value driver in the years 2019 and beyond, provided only that the company doesn't over-extend itself financially in developing these properties.

Drilling will target the Typhoon and Greenewood prospects and begin in early August.


 

Tyranna's joint venture partner, WPG Resources has a mill within trucking distance








Tyranna Resources (ASX:TYX) will commence a drill program in early August 2017 with the objective of increasing the gold resource at the Jumbuck Gold Project in South Australia.

	The 5,000-metre reverse circulation program will target the company’s priority prospects - Typhoon and Greenewood.

	The current resource stands at 219,000 ounces of gold and Tyranna aims to increase the deposit towards the exploration target of 500,000 ounces of gold.

	This richly endowed group of tenements surrounds the operating Challenger Gold Mine which is operated by Tyranna’s joint venture partner, WPG Resources (ASX:WPG).

	Tyranna’s strategy is to build its gold endowment so it’s sufficient to support a standalone gold project.

	Bruno Seneque, managing director, commented

	“These drill results to date at our target prospects within Jumbuck clearly indicate that we have high grade and plentiful gold mineralisation.

	“Drilling to date has enhanced our knowledge of the geological settings and assisted us to effectively adjust our drill program to focus on building our gold resource.

	“We know we have a good project on our hands and now we are getting down to the business of extracting that value by building the resource.”

	Drilling following up a successful 2016 campaign

	The Jumbuck Gold Project consists of 9,762 square kilometres of tenements, some of which are held in joint venture with WPG Resources (Tyranna: 72%, WPG: 28%).

	The Typhoon and Greenewood prospects are held within joint venture tenements.

	A total of 14,389 metres was drilled at the Jumbuck Gold Project during the 2016 calendar year with the aim to explore for high-grade open pit, gold mineralisation within trucking distance of the Challenger gold operations.

	2,000 metres planned at Typhoon

	The Typhoon gold prospect ranks as one of Tyranna’s most promising gold prospects due to the high gold grades encountered in its maiden drilling program.

	The phase 2 program of 2,000 metres of reverse circulation drilling will focus on strike extensions and testing a parallel structure.

	Significant assays from phase 1 include:

	- 1 metre at 50.7 g/t gold from 71 metres;
	- 13 metres at 3.88 g/t gold from 47 metres;
	- 5 metres at 2.55 g/t gold from 70 metres; and
	- 14 metres at 1.24 g/t  gold from 32 metres.

	3,000 metres planned at Greenewood

	The Greenewood gold prospect will be drilled with 3,000 metres of reverse circulation drilling after Typhoon to test strike continuation, a parallel lode and a geochemical anomaly.

	Significant drill results during the 2016 calendar year included:

	- 1 metre at 20.55 g/t gold from 47 metres;
	- 3 metres at 8.26 g/t gold from 26 metres;
	- 14 metres at 5.79 g/t gold from 35 metres; and
	- 1 metre at 23.4 g/t gold from 27 metres.

	Drill results to be used to calculate a resource upgrade

	A resource upgrade will be calculated after the completion of drilling in early October 2017.

	Tyranna entered the September quarter with a cash balance $1.4 million.

TM editors' note: This article discusses a penny stock and/or microcap. Such stocks are easily manipulated; do your own careful due diligence.
Written by SmallCapPower.com
Shares of Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. (TSX:NDM), which explores one of the world’s largest copper-gold resource at its Pebble project in Alaska, have been seen in a more favourable light recently on positive developments related to the settlement with the EPA.

Northern Dynasty Minerals' stock had been on an upward trend in anticipation of favorable news going back to March, 2017.
Then on April 12,  2017, its share price zoomed nearly 32% to reach $1.89 on news that the Alaska Department of Natural Resources issued a notice of approval of Miscellaneous Land Use Permit for the Pebble Project.
In the run up to the settlement, the shares surged nearly 28% on May 8 and 9 to close at $2.84 but had been on a gradual decline due to the “buy on rumor” and “sell on news” behaviour of investors.
Northern Dynasty Minerals' stock gained 8% post the July 11 news of the EPA beginning the process to withdraw its earlier restriction under the CWA.

Investment Thesis 

On May 12th, Northern Dynasty Minerals announced the legal settlement with EPA, which should pave the way for the development of the Pebble project
The Pebble copper-gold hosts contained resources of 57 billion pounds of copper and 70 M ozt of gold
Balance sheet is healthy with $54.7 million of cash equivalents and no debt

Legal settlement with EPA clears obstacles for Pebble mine development
After nearly a decade of litigations with regulators, Northern Dynasty Minerals announced on May 12 2017, that it reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. EPA that allows the Pebble Project to proceed into normal course permitting under the CWA and National Environmental Policy Act.
On July 11, 2017, consequent to the settlement agreement, the EPA began a process to withdraw a Proposed Determination it issued under the Clean Water Act in 2014, which paves the way for the normal development of the large copper and gold Pebble Project.

Eureka Earns 100% Interest in Gold Creek Property

South Africa’s “Unlawful”… »

Eureka Resources (TSXV:EUK) is pleased to announce that it has completed all requirements to earn a 100% interest in the Gold Creek property. The exploration expenditures incurred in Eureka’s May 2017 drill program satisfied the work commitment portion of the Gold Creek option. In addition, the Company has issued 150,000 common shares to Bullion Gold Resources Corp. (TSX-V: BGD) to complete the share commitment portion of the option agreement (see news release dated November 15, 2016).
The Gold Creek property is located in the historic Cariboo Gold district in central British Columbia. The property consists of 33 claims (9673.26 hectares) and is located 2 kms north of the village of Likely, B.C. and 6 kms northwest of the Spanish Mountain deposit. The Company owns 100% of the Gold Creek property, subject to a 1% NSR royalty in favour of Bullion Gold Resources Corp., half of which can be acquired by Eureka for $1,000,000.
Michael Sweatman, Eureka’s CEO stated, “Completion of this earn-in is consistent with Eureka’s objective of acquiring 100% interests in our properties. This allows us the flexibility to advance the properties directly or through joint ventures, avoiding the obligations that earn-in agreements impose.”
“Our thoughts are with the Cariboo residents whose lives have been disrupted by the current wildfire situation in BC.”
ABOUT EUREKA
Eureka is an exploration focused company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, whose strategy is to acquire projects in prospective areas that have the potential to deliver important new discoveries and create value for its shareholders.
British Columbia, Canada
Eureka’s 100% owned FG Gold property is an advanced-stage gold project located in the Cariboo Mining Division. Historical exploration has established a Measured and Indicated (376,000 ounces) gold resource at an average grade of 0.776 g/t gold, using a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t, and an Inferred gold resource (634,900 ounces) at an average grade of 0.718 g/t gold, using a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t. Details of the gold resource can be found in “NI 43-101 Technical Report, Frasergold Exploration Project, Cariboo Mining Division, dated July 27, 2015” available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR or on the Company’s website.
Eureka has a 100 percent interest in the Gold Creek property located in the Cariboo Mining Division. Gold Creek is a grassroots gold project neighbouring, and with similar geology to the Spanish Mountain deposit owned by Spanish Mountain Gold Ltd. (TSXV: SPA).
Eureka has the option to earn a 100 percent interest in the CKN property located in the Cariboo Mining Division. The CKN property is adjacent to Taseko’s Gibraltar mine and consists of two mineral claims covering 1,356 hectares.
Yukon Territory, Canada
Eureka’s 100 percent owned Luxor property consists of four non-contiguous claim blocks totalling 384 mining claims. Luxor is located in the Dawson Range Gold Belt, a district of major porphyry, breccia and vein occurrences.
Eureka’s 100 percent owned TAK property is also located in the Dawson Range Gold Belt and consists of 82 mining claims.
Neighbouring projects include Goldcorp’s Coffee project and Kinross’ Golden Saddle project.
Nevada, USA

Objective
Gold Resource Corporation (NYSE MKT: GORO) is a gold and silver producer targeting projects that feature low
        operating costs and high returns on capital. The Company's primary focus is on cash flow, with a priority to
        return meaningful dividends back to the owners of the Company, its shareholders. The Company has two
        mining units located in mining friendly jurisdictions of North America. The "Oaxaca Mining Unit"
        consists of 100% interest in 6 potential high-grade gold and silver properties in the southern state of Oaxaca,
        Mexico. The "Nevada Mining Unit" consists of 100% interest in three, with an option to acquire 100%
        interest in a fourth, potential high-grade gold properties in the Walker Lane Mineral Belt in western Nevada,
        U.S.A.
GORO successfully declared commercial production from its Oaxaca Mining Unit July 1, 2010 from a shallow,
        high-grade open pit at its Aguila project, which enabled the Company to reach production and cash flow in the
        shortest amount of time with one of the tightest capital structures for a producer.  In March of 2011, GORO
        announced production from its polymetallic Arista mine. The Arista deposit is comprised of the Arista and
        Switchback vein systems, both contain high-grade gold and silver as well as the base metals of copper, lead and
        zinc.  The Company targets the extensions of this deposit and is exploring for additional deposits at its Oaxaca
        Mining Unit to add to its production profile.
GORO received a mine permit for the Mirador Mine in October 2016 located on the Alta Gracia property, and expects
        first production from this operation during 2017. The Mirador Mine will be the second operating mine within the
        Company's Oaxaca Mining Unit.
The Company's Nevada Mining Unit consists of four properties with the Isabella Pearl Project being the
        closest to reaching gold production. The project is in advanced stage engineering and permitting and the Company
        is working towards production at the earliest possible point in time. Gold Resource Corporation's Nevada
        Mining Unit now controls approximately 27,300 acres of development and exploration lands in south central Nevada's
        Walker Lane Mineral Belt.
The Company has distributed consecutive monthly dividends since commercial production totaling over $109 million
        as of January 2017.  The Company's dividend target is to return as much back to shareholders as soon as
        possible, while balancing the needs of the operations and paying taxes. The Company has remained profitable for
        six consecutive years, four of which were during bear markets in the precious metal space.
Mexico and Nevada U.S.A. are among the leading venues for mineral potential each with an extensive history of
        mining. Gold Resource Corporation is positioning to add to its current production profile from its Mexican
        operations by rapidly advancing its Nevada Mining Unit's potential for open pit heap leach operations.

Gold Resource Corporation Gold and Silver Dividend Program
Gold Resource Corporation (GRC) shareholders have the option to receive gold and silver dividends by converting
        their cash dividend into physical gold and / or silver providing direct exposure to physical precious metals.
        Upon execution and conversion from cash into physical, the shareholder has the option to take delivery of their
        physical precious metals, direct their physical into a Gold Bullion International approved vault or direct the
        metals into a vault of their choosing.
For complete information on how GRC dividends are distributed in physical gold and / or silver and how to open up
        a shareholder "bullion account", please read the external website referral below and click "I
        Agree".



The Gold Resource Corporation "GRC Eagles" one ounce round was designed to honor both the United States
        of America and the United States of Mexico and their ties to the Mining Industry. The design integration of the
        American Eagle clutching a pick and shovel and an image of a miner's face hidden in the mountains of Pikes
        Peak pays homage to the industry. The Mexican Eagle side proudly displays the name Oaxaca Mexico and the date
        2010 denoting the year Gold Resource Corporation reached commercial production from the Company's Oaxaca
        Mining Unit in Oaxaca, Mexico.

Commitment to Community

Gold Resource Corporation (GRC) understands and embraces the social responsibilities that come with operating a progressive mining company, and management is committed to exemplary corporate citizenship within the communities in which it operates.  Gold Resource Corporation operates in Mexico through two wholly owned Mexican subsidiaries; Golden Trump Resources S.A. de C.V. and Don David S.A. de C.V..  As the Company's Mexican operations evolve, GRC will focus on both engaging the local workforce and on promoting economic sectors beyond GRC's specific operations.
Presently, GRC is involved in supporting the development of one of the area's premier natural attractions: the Natural Springs and Travertine Deposits of Salina Blanca. The objective is to help the local communities create a sustainable economic resource: tourism. Additionally, GRC is working on establishment of community recycling programs and is assisting with local road improvements. During Christmas, the Company donates to local Ejido (agrarian communities) so no child is left without a present. GRC also assists in meeting the area's health needs, and compensates a local dentist for providing free community oral health services.
GRC's goal is to help create actual social and economic benefits and improve the overall standard of living for the communities in which it operates. As GRC moves further toward mine development, its contributions and work with the community will increase as well.

First Week of GORO September 15th Options Trading






GORO Stock Crowded With Sellers













Shares of GORO Now Oversold
In trading on Thursday, shares of Gold Resource Corp entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $4.59 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

YieldBoost Gold Resource Corp From 0.4% To 11.7% Using Options
Shareholders of Gold Resource Corp looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 0.4% annualized dividend yield can sell the June covered call at the $7.50 strike and collect the premium based on the 25 cents bid, which annualizes to an additional 11.3% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 11.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $7.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but GORO shares would have to advance 44.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 49.3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Is a C Corporation Right For Your Business?
What you need to know about forming a C Corporation













What Is a C Corporation?
A C Corporation is one of several ways to legally recognize a business for tax, regulatory and official reasons. A C Corp is simply a way to structure ownership of a business, and contrasts with other popular business structures including Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), S Corporations, Sole Proprietorships and others.
Generally, a C Corporation structure is better for larger businesses. This is particularly true if they intend to publicly trade shares, through having an Initial Public Offering, or IPO. A C Corporation is much more attractive to potential investors, including venture capitalists and shareholders because it allows wider ownership of the corporation.
The majority of larger businesses in the United States are structured as C Corporations, although a C Corp could, theoretically, consist of just one person. The information below will help you decide if a C Corporation structure is right for your business.
How Is a C Corporation Formed?
A C Corp, also known as a corporation, is a type of business entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing “Articles of Incorporation” with the Secretary of State in the state of incorporation. The policies, articles, cost and regulations for forming a C Corp vary from state-to-state. Details on exactly how to form a C Corporation can be found at the end of this article.
The corporation is the oldest form of business entity. It has long been a successful way to do business and allows groups of individuals to pool their resources and capital to pursue a common purpose, with their risk limited solely to the amount of stock they own. Although a C Corp is a popular business structure, there are other options for forming businesses in the US.
The Advantages of C Corporations
Forming a C Corporation does have several benefits:
1. A C Corporation has Limited Liability
Because a C Corp is a separate legal entity, the liabilities of the business are separate from the liabilities of the directors, investors and shareholders. Generally, the owners of a C Corporation are protected from being liable for the business’s obligations. This does not apply in all cases, for example if corporate funds are misused, there is wilful fraud, or if certain rules and regulations are not followed.
2. A C Corporation Exists Independently of its Owners
A C Corporation can have “Perpetual Existence” — this is in contrast to sole proprietorships or partnerships where a business only exists for as long as the proprietors or owners are alive and in the business.
3. Ownership of C Corporations Can Be Fluid and Transferred
Ownership in a C Corporation is decided by who holds the stocks it issues. These stocks can be bought and sold between investors, and if the company’s shares are publicly traded on a stock exchange, institutions and members of the public can own stock in the company.
4. Ease of Access to Funding Through Issuing Stock
If a C Corporation want to raise money, it can hold an “Initial Public Offering (IPO)” where it “goes public” and offers shares for sale on a stock exchange. This can bring significant money into a business. They can also choose to issue shares periodically to raise further funding, although this can dilute the value of existing shares.
5. Enhanced Business or Corporate Credibility
Most of the businesses that are household names are C Corporations. Incorporating as a C Corp demonstrates to others that you expect to see significant growth and can enhance the business’s credibility and authority.
The Disadvantages of a C Corporation
A C Corporation does have some disadvantages. Briefly, they are:

A different tax structure to other types of businesses.
Double taxation for investors when dividends are paid to them.
Legal rules, regulations, formalities, and compliance they have to meet.

We cover these in more detail below.
What Are the Differences Between an S Corp, C Corp and LLC?
Two other popular business entity structures in the US are the S Corp and the LLC. They provide many of the same protections offered by a C Corp but have less formal rules on taxation, governance and compliance. This can mean more flexibility in how an LLC or S Corp is owned and funded.
One of the main differences between C Corps and S Corps / LLCs are how income from the different types of businesses are taxed.

For LLCs and S Corps, any income earned by the business “flows through” to the business owners’ / shareholders’ / members’ tax returns, where it is taxed as part of1 their overall income. The company does not have to file a separate tax return.
S Corps and C Corps can pass on some of their profits to shareholders as dividends.
S Corps are limited to having a maximum of 100 shareholders.
A C Corp is taxed at the corporate level — That means it has to file a separate tax return as a business entity and will need to pay corporation tax on any profits earned.

How Are Profits And Taxes Handled With A C Corp?
A C Corporation is taxed as a separate business entity. Unlike individuals, C Corporations have to file a designated tax form with the IRS, which is called IRS Form 1120. Additionally, C Corporations have their own tax rates.
Corporations can retain some of their profits and earnings as part of their operating capital, this can shelter some of the profits from taxation.
C Corporation Tax Rates
The tax rates levied on C Corporations are as follows.
Profit

Up to $50,000 — 15%
$50,000 - $75,000 — 25%
$75,000 - $100,000 — 34%
$100,000 - $335,000 — 39%
$335,000 - $10,000,000 — 34%
$10,000,000 - $15,000,000 — 35%
$15,000,000 - $18,333,333 — 38%
More than $18,333,333 — 35%

Stock Dividends from C Corporations
A C Corporation may choose to distribute some of the profits of the company as dividends, which are distributed to shareholders. The percentage of dividends that each shareholder is entitled to depends on how many shares they own.
Dividends that are distributed to shareholders are taxed twice (double-taxed). They are taxed first at the corporate level as profit (on the corporation’s form 1120), and again at the individual level as stock dividends (on the shareholder's form 1040).
What are a C Corporation's Legal Requirements?
A C Corporation must meet certain requirements:
1. Hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) for the shareholders and the board of directors
The annual meetings are used to discuss and decide important information, strategic decisions, opportunities, risks and issues that the corporation will need to deal with.
2. Issue shares to investors as ownership of the business
Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares. The management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.
3. Appoint a board of directors
The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also drafts bylaws for the corporation. These are written protocols that state the way that the corporation will be governed.
4. Assign Certain Positions in the Corporation
A C Corporation will need to have all of the following positions. In a small C Corp, one person could hold multiple of these positions.

Shareholders: They own the company's stock and are responsible for electing directors, amending the bylaws and articles of incorporation and approving major actions taken by the corporation like mergers and the sale of corporate assets. They alone are allowed to dissolve the corporation.
Directors: They manage the corporation and are responsible for issuing stock, electing officers and making the corporation's major decisions.
Officers: The corporation must have a president, secretary, and treasurer. These officers are responsible for making the day-to-day decisions that govern the corporation's operation.
Employees: They receive a salary in return for their work for the corporation.

Forming a C Corporation
If a C Corporation is right for you, here’s how to form one:

Choose a legal name for your new business.
If the Secretary of State in your state reserves business names, reserve the name.
Draft and file your Articles of Incorporation — These should be sent to your Secretary of State.
Establish who your initial investors and shareholders are.
Create and issue stock certificates to your shareholders.
Apply for a business license — You may require licenses from your state, county, and township.
Apply for any other certificates you need to conduct business — These can vary from industry to industry.
Get an “Employer Identification Number (EIN): from the IRS — You can file online, or complete form SS-4.
Apply for any other ID numbers and complete other formalities required by your state and local government agencies.
Requirements do vary from one jurisdiction to another, but you will generally need to get ID numbers for the unemployment, disability and other payroll taxes.
Appoint a board of directors.
Assign other positions in the business as required by law.

Forming a C Corporation can be tricky, so let us do the hard work for you. Here at IncFile, we’ve helped to form thousands of businesses, and our experts are on hand to help you, right now. Incorporate your business with Incfile for as little as $49 plus the state fee.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.

long as needed to find an available company
name.
