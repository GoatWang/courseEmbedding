BBB Accreditation





            Adeptus Health, Inc., at its headquarters and all its company-owned locations throughout
             is a BBB Accredited Business.
        

                BBB Accredited Since 06/09/2008
            

                BBB has determined that Adeptus Health, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Adeptus Health Inc. Receives NYSE Notice Regarding Late Form 10-K Filing
        																																												
              
















 News provided by
Adeptus Health Inc.

 Share this article




























































LEWISVILLE, Texas, March 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Adeptus Health Inc. (NYSE:   ADPT) (the "Company") announced today that, as a result of its failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the "Form 10-K"), it has received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") that the Company is not in compliance with the NYSE's continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria established in Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. 








As previously disclosed, the Company's delay in filing the Form 10-K is due principally to the additional time the Company requires to complete its analysis of impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and evaluation of the need to write down its deferred tax assets. In addition, the Company has identified material weaknesses with respect to internal control over financial reporting in the areas of revenue recognition, accounts receivable, accounting for a contribution to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accounting for equity in (loss) earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures. Related to these areas where material weaknesses have been identified, the Company is evaluating the effect of errors in its condensed consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statements for prior periods. An analysis of root causes and remediation plans are still in process. Also, there remains substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern absent its securing committed long-term financing. Finally, the Company requires additional time to complete its financial closing procedures. The Company will not be able to file the Form 10-K until such matters have been resolved and the audit of its consolidated financial statements for 2016 is completed. The Company will file the Form 10-K as soon as practicable. 
The NYSE informed the Company that, under the NYSE's rules, the Company will have six months from March 16, 2017 to file the Form 10-K with the SEC. The Company can regain compliance with the NYSE listing standards before that date by filing the Form 10-K with the SEC.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Forward-looking statements involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Any forward-looking statements herein are made as of the date of this filing, and the Company undertakes no duty to update or revise any such statements except as required by the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results, developments and business decisions to differ materially from forward-looking statements are described in ADPT's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") from time to time and which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Among the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those provided in this communication are: our inability to execute a restructuring that maximizes value for all constituents while minimizing disruption to the Company's operations; the risk that the analyses and evaluations discussed above are not completed in a timely manner; the risk that the failure to file the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 in a timely manner could lead to the acceleration of the maturity of certain of the Company's indebtedness and other financial obligations or the delisting of the Company's Class A common stock by the NYSE; the risk that these or other risk factors impact the expected timing of the filing of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016; our ability to implement our growth strategy; delays in conversion of patient receivables into cash, as well as increased potential for bad debt expense, associated with deficiencies in billing and collections related to our services; our ability to protect our brand; federal and state laws and regulations relating to our facilities, which could lead to the incurrence of significant penalties by us or require us to make significant changes to our operations; our ability to locate available facility sites on terms acceptable to us; competition from hospitals, clinics and other emergency care providers; our dependence on payments from third-party payors; our ability to source and procure new products and equipment to meet patient preferences; our reliance on Medical Properties Trust ("MPT") and the MPT Master Funding and Development Agreements; disruptions in the global financial markets leading to difficulty in borrowing sufficient amounts of capital to finance the carrying costs of inventory to pay for capital expenditures and operating costs; our ability or the ability of our healthcare system partners to negotiate favorable contracts or renew existing contracts with third-party payors on favorable terms; significant changes in our payor mix or case mix resulting from fluctuations in the types of cases treated at our facilities; significant changes in the rules, regulations and systems governing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements; material changes in IRS revenue rulings, case law or the interpretation of such rulings; shortages of, or quality control issues with, emergency care-related products, equipment and medical supplies that could result in a disruption of our operations; the intense competition we face for patients, physician use of our facilities, strategic relationships and commercial payor contracts; the fact that we are subject to significant malpractice and related legal claims; the growth of patient receivables or the deterioration in the ability to collect on those accounts; the impact on us of PPACA, which represents a significant change to the healthcare industry; and ensuring our continued compliance with HIPAA, which could require us to expend significant resources and capital; and the factors discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and its Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Job Scam Alert
We’ve heard that an individual or individuals impersonating an Adeptus Health hiring manager may be conducting online “interviews” and attempting to convince people to send money, supposedly to purchase equipment or set up payroll direct deposit as part of the hiring process. Rest assured, Adeptus Health and its affiliates never do business in this manner. We do NOT solicit payments or payment information from candidates. If you are contacted by anyone requesting payment from you to get a job with Adeptus Health, please don’t respond.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Adeptus Health, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 2 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

“After what had seemed to be a long polo season my horses were suddenly responding with increased athletic performance. They seemed more “Fresh” in July than they did in January. The only change in my operation was now I was playing in San Diego with Dr. Colleen Wilson on her Adeptus Polo Team and I was using her Adeptus products. My string of polo ponies felt rejuvenated after almost 6 solid months of polo across the United States. The performance increase that Adeptus gave my horses at the end of my polo season gives me confidence and an advantage going into the next polo season.”
Joseph Stuart
Professional Polo Player
“Adeptus products have helped the horses at Copper Meadows Eventing look and feel great. We have seen increased weight gain in our hard keepers, shiny coats on all the horses, and increased stamina during competitions. We ask a lot from the horses in our barn, and with the help of Adeptus products we get the best from them. Several horses in the barn were on expensive ulcer treatment programs which have been replaced with the Adeptus Allay, and we are seeing huge strides in their comfort at and away from home on the product. There is an Adeptus product for every horse in our barn!”
Taren & James Atkinson
Olympic 3-Day Eventers
“The levels of competition and performance demands on our horses are ever increasing. Reining horses are very physical and we ask alot of them as young horses. Ensuring their bodies can stand up to the work with minimal adverse effects and allowing them to have a long show career is very important. The healthier our horses are and better they feel then the better they can also perform. I have spent alot of time looking for supplements for my horses that not only contain enough of the right ingredients but also ingredients in a form my horse can actually utilize. For this reason I have chosen Adeptus. Having the horses in my barn on Adeptus products gives me the confidence that my horses’ bodies have the right nutrients available on a daily basis to repair, rebuild and grow. The Nimble Supreme allows my horses’ joints to be healthier meaning less down time with soreness, less need for injections and a horse happier to do his job. Augment gives my horses a good balance of essential nutrients, including hoof care. No hoof, no horse. I even take them myself so I can keep up with my horses.”

“I have been familiar with the Adeptus products for several years now, and have always been very impressed with the in-depth research and development that each product was based upon. I always found it very helpful and educational to be able to talk to Dr.Colleen Wilson in person with regards to the special needs of different horses I was working with. Just recently I was introduced to the NIMBLE MEGA NUTRIENT and INVIGOR. I noticed a great difference in my horses’ interior and exterior well-being. Ever since I started him on these products he is definitely more eager to work because he is more comfortable. He feels good so the work is getting easier for him! It has been the most positive experience I have had with any supplement I have used! Therefore, I also recommended the NIMBLE MEGA NUTRIENT for my daughter Natasha’s showjumper. He is an older horse competing at the High Junior Jumpers. Since he started on NIMBLE MEGA NUTRIENT, he has had his most consistent and successful show circuit ever!”

“I have been aware of Adeptus for several years and now I’m proud to say I have all of my horses on Adeptus products.  I am pleased they offer top quality products at affordable prices, and Dr. Colleen Wilson is knowledgeable and easy to work with.
When it comes to my horses’ nutritional needs, there is no substitute for quality. Adeptus provides my equine partners with a balanced combination of nutrients, giving them the edge they need to perform at the top of their game. Currently, I am using the Nimble Mega on three competing FEI horses.  I also, love Allay because it has allowed my horses to handle the demands of training by being more relaxed and concentrated on their work. Adeptus has something for all of my horses, from young horses developing muscles, my upper-level horses and the slightly older horses that need to feel good during their work.  I have seen remarkable changes in the health, performance and overall happiness of the horses in my barn and now I have these wonderful products to thank. I would recommend Adeptus to everyone, and with several options to choose from, there is sure to be something created with the specific needs of your equine friend in mind.  I have selected Adeptus as my nutrition partner due to the commitment to equine nutrition excellence.  My horses and I are grateful for your continued support!”

Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Patient Satisfaction
Adeptus Health’s First Choice Emergency Room offers a dramatically improved patient experience relative to traditional hospital emergency departments by significantly reducing wait times and providing rapid access to Board-Certified physicians on-site. Important to the community is the convenient access to critical, high‑acuity care as compared with urgent care centers, as well as sites that are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Based on patient feedback collected by Press Ganey Associates, Inc., an independent healthcare advisory services and consulting organization that specializes in the improvement of the patient experience, First Choice Emergency Room received the prestigious Guardian of Excellence Award for four consecutive years from 2013 - 2016 for exceeding the 95th percentile in patient satisfaction nationwide.
