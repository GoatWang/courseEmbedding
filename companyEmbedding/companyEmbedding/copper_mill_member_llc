Southwire Company, LLC sells and manufactures the most technically advanced continuous rod system to produce electrolytic tough pitch (ETP) copper rod in the world. Southwire has been designing, operating and selling continuous copper rod mills since 1963. Southwire has continued the improvement and development of the system to increase product quality and decrease the operating costs. The Southwire Continuous Rod (SCR) process allows production of the highest quality copper wire rod at the lowest possible cost. Because of the ease of maintenance and operation, the Southwire system has higher availability than competing systems, which further lowers operating costs. Frequent system startups for new customers ensure that start-ups are well planned and minimize the required field services. Smooth startups get the customer's equipment into production quickly to meet market demand. Fifty percent (50%) of all copper rod made in the world is produced with Southwire SCR technology. 
Within the total continuous system concept, Southwire Company, LLC designs and builds the shaft furnace, furnace loading system, launders for transferring the molten metal, variable-volume rotary holding furnace, wheel and belt casting machine and cast bar preparation machine. The rolling mill, shearing and coiling equipment are designed and built by Primetals Technologies of Worcester, Massachusetts, USA. The Morgan No Twist® rolling mill stands are independently driven for flexibility to produce different rod diameters. The electrical control systems, supplied by a reputable electrical supplier, use modern and advanced digital controls. Southwire provides the design engineering to integrate all the machines and support systems for the chosen production rate. Also, Southwire Company, LLC provides the operational training and know-how based on the operation of its own SCR copper rod mill operated in Carrollton, Georgia, USA. 
Southwire has sold more than 90 copper SCR Systems around the world.
Southwire SCR Systems feature:

Lowest operating costs 
Superior product quality 
Latest technology 
Unmatched start-up reliability
Engineering services to match PURCHASER's requirements
The Southwire SCR® Continuous Rod system is an advanced process for the continuous production of copper rod. Southwire operates its own 48 metric tons per hour (tph) copper rod mill in Carrollton, GA, USA with an annual rod production of over 320,000 metric tons. 
Achieving High productivity
For the production of Electrolytic Tough Pitch (ETP) copper wire rod, SCR systems have high availability and productivity. This high productivity and availability are achieved with a combination of: ease of setup, long continuous runs, improved process control and automation, highest rod quality and heavy duty and reliable machinery. 
Input Feed Materials
The SCR process is very flexible in the choice of input feed materials. The primary feed materials are electrolytic refined cathodes. The Southwire Shaft Furnace can accept full sheet cathodes produced conventionally, by the permanent blank process or SXEW (Solvent Extraction Electrowon) process. Additionally, the shaft furnace can directly accept high-quality copper scrap for melting. Up to 20% high quality scrap can be used. To produce rod for fine wire and magnet wire, Southwire recommends cathode meeting the quality of LME Grade A.

Company Background
Company Mission
Our focus and direction is to be the most market driven, customer-focused,                low cost provider of high quality flow control products to the plumbing,                heating, air conditioning, refrigeration and industrial markets.
A Company Rich In Tradition
Since the company began in 1908, Cerro has always maintained its                pioneering spirit. From the early days of smelting brass ingots                to becoming one of the innovators in the production and handling                of copper tubing worldwide, Cerro has been an industry leader.
Today, Cerro is embarking on a new journey. While we maintain our                focus on a tradition of copper, we will expand into additional product                lines that fit with the markets we serve. Reflecting this change,                Cerro Copper is now Cerro Flow Products LLC.
Our expertise as a manufacturer of copper tubing has enabled us to grow into a full-service                company. In this role, Cerro Flow Products LLC is proud to offer the strength and reliability                of a trusted name as we begin our expansion into new flow product solutions.
To help you stay ahead of the competition, we look forward to providing                you with the highest-quality, competitively-priced products and                value-added services now and in the future.
We’re Cerro Flow Products LLC – the trusted                brand for over 100 years.

1908 – Founded as L.J. Cohen Co., dealers in scrap iron                  and other metals.


1920s – Renamed Lewin Metals, the company experimented                  with electrolysis, the refining process to make purer grades of                  copper.


1927 – Lewin Metals built its own electrolytic refinery                  in Sauget, Illinois.


1939 – After merging with the G. Mathes Co. to become                  Lewin-Mathes Co., the company built its first copper tube mill.


1940s – As the U.S. entered World War II, Lewin-Mathes                  made parts for projectiles, tube for cargo and combat ships and                  other war products.


1957 – Lewin-Mathes Co. became part of Cerro de Pasco                  Corp., which financed construction of the present mill in Sauget,                  Illinois.


1962 – State-of-the-art extrusion press begins new era                  in copper tube production.
