								About Us
							












PHILOSOPHY
The store and online are essential partners in retail. Digital channels have unlimited reach and high growth, but struggle with conversion. Meanwhile physical stores provide a highly contextual experience which drives high conversion, but the storeâs limited reach results in low growth.
We believe in leveraging the inherent strength of online and in-store,  to converge the retail using the unique context of local markets to enhance the customer experience driving more value to both channels.
