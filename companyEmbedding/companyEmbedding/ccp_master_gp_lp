Introduction
Fisheries Certificate Website

For more detailed information on the Catch Certification Program and the EU regulation, please visit the Catch Certification Program website.
Catch Certification Program (CCP)

Provides client services to Canadian exporters


1b. Catch Certification Program: Integration and Planning Bureau (IPB)
                
Responsible for Program coordination, reporting, development and integration 
Acts as single liaison bureau with European Union officials and national-level stakeholders


2. Fisheries Certificate System (FCS)
                
A web-based system for industry applications and DFO validation / issuance of catch certificates


3. Catch Certification Audit Office (CCAO)

Responsible for post-issuance audits of catch certificates

Chat - clicking this icon will begin a chat session with a Certification Officer.

Note: When navigating in the system, only use the buttons within the system. Pressing the back or forward button in your internet browser may cause errors
Catch Certificate Application
The first navigation menu item is Create Application. When you click on ‘Create Application', the following screen should appear:
  
1) Applicant Name - this dropdown menu displays your company name
2) View List of Exempted Species - opens a Portable Document Format (PDF) file that contains a list of species that are exempt from the EU Regulation, meaning that they will not require a catch certificate for exportation. You can check this list to see whether or not you will require a catch certificate for a specific species.
3) Application Type - this dropdown menu allows you to choose from the different application items available within the system.
Types of Applications

Catch Certificate - Request Grouping: allows a user to create groups (i.e. of vessels or buyers) within the FCS, which will make applying for catch certificates faster and easier.

                Instructions to apply for a Catch Certificate - Request Grouping 


EU Catch Certificate - Standard: This is an application for a European Community Catch Certificate, as published in Annex II of the EU Council Regulation (EC) no 1005/2008. This application form will require that each of the vessels involved in the catch be identified along with the vessel's relevant information.

                Instructions to apply for a EU Catch Certificate - Standard


EU Catch Certificate - Group Based: This is a variation of the European Community Catch Certificate that accommodates situations where the catch is based on a pre-approved group (Before a group-based catch certificate can be created, you must first create a grouping by applying for a “Catch Certificate - Request Grouping”).

                Instructions to apply for a EU Catch Certificate - Group-Based 


EU Catch Certificate - Foreign Export: This is an application for what is known as an Annex IV in the EU Regulation. This type of certificate is required for product that is imported by a Canadian company from a foreign country, and then exported from Canada to the European Community.

                Instructions to apply for an EU Catch Certificate - Foreign Export

4) Application Method -allows for different methods to complete an application:


On Line Form - The recommended and most common type of application method due to its efficiency. This option allows the user to enter all required data into the FCS system online.
Consolidate from Existing Certificates - Consolidation is used in cases where you (the exporter) have a consignment that includes products from different sources that would require a consolidation of more than one approved certificate, either from your own company or forwarded to you from other companies. Individual approved certificates can be consolidated into a single catch certificate by clicking on this option. A consolidated catch certificate does not have to be submitted for validation, as it can only be created using existing approved certificates and information already stored within the FCS system. Click the following to find more detailed information regarding Consolidating Catch Certificates.
Attached XML File - Selecting this option allows the user to create a catch certificate application by uploading an XML file, generated by their internal information system (Note: this feature is not available for Catch Certificate - Request Grouping)


Lookup Tables
Each application will have the option to use what are known as Lookup tables for various fields. These Lookup tables increase efficiency when adding information into your catch certificate application by allowing you to search DFO databases for information. Lookup tables in the FCS are used to assist adding vessels, species, products, countries, communities, flags and home ports to your certificate. Fields that require the use of a Lookup table will have a button to the right of them that says ‘Lookup', once clicked, a separate window will open with the Lookup table.
Types of Searches
When searching for items using the Lookup table, FCS will limit the return of searched items to 100 records. If a search results in more than 100 returned records, the FCS will advise you that the search criteria must be refined. It is therefore mandatory that you narrow the potential list of items by conducting a search that is more specific to the item that you require. (This is most common when using a vessel lookup)
Exact Match - Enter the exact Vessel Name, VRN or Region, or any combination of these fields and click the ‘Search' button. FCS will return any records that match the data entered. 
Wild Card Searches - Wild card searches can be conducted using the % character. 

For example: To search for all vessels beginning with the word May in the vessel name, enter May%. FCS will return only those records with the word May appearing at the beginning of the vessel name. 
To search for all vessels ending with the word May in the vessel name, enter %May. FCS will return only those records with the word May appearing at the end of the vessel name. 
To search for all vessels with the word May appearing anywhere in the vessel name, enter %May%. FCS will return only those records with the word May appearing somewhere in the vessel name. 

Once your search is complete and you have successfully found the item that you are looking for, you must now select it. To select a single item within a Lookup table, click on the record and FCS will highlight the row in the colour blue. To select multiple items, hold the Ctrl key down and click on the items of interest.
Click on the ‘OK' button to add the item and return to FCS screen. FCS will automatically create a record for the item(s) selected in the lookup.
Creating an Application
The following information is common to each type of application within the FCS.
To create an application, click on ‘Create Application', then select the Application Type, then click ‘Continue'. 
Note: You will notice throughout the application process that some fields are coloured blue. Only blue fields are mandatory.
The following screen will appear when you click ‘Continue':

Adobe Reader is required to view reports in PDF. Adobe Reader may be downloaded free at: http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/
 Tabs - Each application will have tabs listed. These tabs are the primary means of navigating through the system.

 Important Note: Selecting the ‘Back' button on your browser will not always work in the system and may cause errors. To minimize any potential errors or problems, you should only browse the pages using the buttons within the system.
Catch Certificate - Request Grouping
The use of groupings for Canada's catch certification scheme is meant to accommodate complex fisheries where the interactions along the value chain create challenges in creating Catch Certificate - Standard applications. Groupings will create efficiencies in completing applications where the source of the product does not have to be re-entered at every application, a user can simply select the relevant groupings for the consignment.
Groupings must be created within the FCS. Groupings can be vessel-based (group of vessels you own or purchase from) or community-based (group of communities or buyer / agent you purchase from). After creating one or more grouping(s), you can then use them for all future catch certificates. 
To create a grouping, click on ‘Create Application' in the Navigation Menu, then select Application Type: Catch Certificate - Request Grouping, then click ‘Continue'. 
The grouping section is broken down into tabs. The first of which is the group detail tab.
Group Detail Tab
The Group Detail tab appears as follows:
  
Application Description - This field is intended to provide a description for the user's record management. It is a free text field that allows a user to create an identifier for the grouping for easy reference and record tracking.

Associated Species - Click the ‘Lookup' button to select the species that will be associated with the grouping. (Note: A grouping may only be associated with one species)


Group Name - the name for the group being created, this is for CCP records only, the Group Name will not appear on the catch certificate.
                
                  *Naming Standards: must include species, area, and gear type (if known)
                    (Example: Lobster - LFA 27 - Traps) 
Group Alias - the alias is essentially a short version of the group name that will be displayed on the catch certificate.
                   *Naming Standards: must consist of 6-12 characters including all uppercase letters and containing two consecutive numbers
                    (Ex. LOBSTER50) 
Vessel Group Type - choose this grouping if the vessels that made the catch are known. Vessel details are mandatory with this group type.

Group Sub-Types:
                    
Buyer / Agent - If the catch was purchased from a buyer / agent, check the Buyer / Agent box and fill in their information within the Buyer / Agent tab.
Aboriginal - If the catch was made using aboriginal vessels, check the Aboriginal box.



Community Group Type - choose this grouping if vessels involved in the catch are not known at the time of application. This group type will identify in which communities the catch took place. Community details are mandatory with this group type.
                
Group Sub-Types:
                    
Buyer / Agent - If the catch was purchased from a buyer / agent, check the Buyer / Agent box and fill in their information within the Buyer / Agent tab.
Aboriginal - If the catch was made in Aboriginal communities or by Aboriginal harvesters, check the Aboriginal box.



Note: Only choose a community grouping if the vessels are unknown. Since vessel groupings are more traceable, they are the preferred method of groupings.
Collector Vessel Group Type - choose this grouping if there was a collector vessel involved in the catch.

                Please contact the CCP: OC for more information on Collector Vessel groupings. 

Once you select the appropriate group type, you can then move on to creating the group by completing all the mandatory fields throughout each of the tabs in the application. Once all tabs are completed, the grouping request can be submitted. 
Note: The application for a Catch Certificate - Request Grouping has a service standard of 10 business days for processing. You will receive an email upon approval and you will be able to use the group within the FCS to create Catch Certificates - Group-Based. When creating a Catch Certificate - Group Based, you can now select the group(s) that you created, which are applicable to the relevant catch.
Since Vessel and Vessel - Buyer / Agent groupings are the most common, the steps taken to create a vessel grouping and a Buyer / Agent grouping are listed below for your reference. Please contact the CCP's Operations Centre for more information on community-based groupings.
Vessel Grouping

The groupings should be set up to represent all of the vessels that participated in catch for the products that are being exported.
A grouping can contain 2 to 20 vessels. 20 vessels is the maximum number of vessels permitted in a grouping for traceability purposes, however, exceptions can be made based on the nature of your operations, please contact the Operations Centre for more details.
Groupings do not allow vessels that are over 100 feet in length overall. Those vessels need to have their own Catch Certificate - Standard. Some exceptions are permitted, mainly if the vessel operates within an inshore or mid-shore fleet. Off-shore vessels that are over 100 feet in length overall cannot be exempted. Please contact the Operations Centre for vessel exceptions.
If your operations are based on vessels that you own and vessels from which you buy products, it is recommended that you create multiple groupings: one for the vessels you own and another for the vessels you source from.
There is no maximum amount of groupings that a company can create. It is recommended that you group vessels by common characteristics.
                
Common characteristics include:
                    
Species
Fishing Area
Home Port





For example, if you have 10 vessels, 8 of these vessels catch lobster in one fishing area and the other 2 vessels catch silver hake: you would need to create 2 groupings, one for each species. If the 8 lobster vessels didn't fish in the same area (4 fish in LFA 24 and 4 fish in LFA 26), we would suggest creating two lobster groupings, one for each fishing area.
Grouping by common characteristics and keeping groups smaller is beneficial for two reasons. The first is that when you are creating a certificate, it will be much easier for you to select the appropriate groupings (vessels) for the shipment that you are exporting. The second reason is that it increases traceability and provides a more accurate representation of the actual catch that is listed on the catch certificate.
Vessel Grouping Steps
Select ‘Create Application', and then select the Application Type: Catch Certificate - Request Grouping. 
Group Detail Tab
You will see a screen displaying the Group Detail for this Catch Certificate - Request Grouping. Complete the Group Name and Group Alias fields, and then select ‘Vessel' as the group type by clicking the circle next to ‘Vessel'.
The ‘Application Description' field is not mandatory. It is a free text field that allows users to create a description for the grouping for tracking and reference purposes.
Once the Group Detail tab is completed, click on the Vessel tab to continue the application.
Vessel Tab
When adding vessels, it is more efficient to click ‘Add Vessel(s) via Lookup', which will open a window where you can search for vessels in our database. 
Vessel Lookup:
 

Vessel Name - the registered name of the vessel
VRN - the Vessel Registration Number for the vessel
Region - DFO Regions include: Central and Arctic, Gulf, Maritimes, Newfoundland and Labrador, Pacific, and Quebec.

Multiple Vessels Displayed: 
When searching for a vessel, it is common that multiple vessels with the same name, VRN, and Region will be displayed. Multiple vessels are displayed because the FCS Vessel Lookup system extracts vessels from multiple databases at Fisheries and Oceans. It is acceptable to use any of these vessels as long as the Vessel Name, VRN, and Region match the vessel that you require.
Once you search and find the vessel that you need, click the ‘OK' button at the bottom-right of the window. This should refresh the screen and show the vessel, along with its associated information that has been extracted from the database. You then need to add the required vessel information in the remaining fields. It is encouraged that you add all known vessel information into each field. However, it is only mandatory, by EU regulations, to complete the blue fields.
A screenshot of the Vessel Tab page is shown below.
  

Vessel Name - the registered name of the vessel
VRN - the Vessel Registration Number
Overall Length - the overall length of the vessel in meters (Note: vessels over 100 feet (30.48m) cannot be used in groupings and will require their own individual Catch Certificate - Standard)
Flag - country where the vessel is registered
Home Port - the port from which the vessel operates from (This may or may not be the same location as where the catches are landed)
Call Sign - unique designation for a transmitting station
IMO Number - International Maritime Organization Number (ex. IMO 12345467)
Lloyds Number - Lloyds Register Number
Master Name - name of the master of the vessel
Authorized Processing Type on Board - select whether or not there is authorized processing on-board. If processing is able to be completed on board of the vessel, then select ‘Processing' from the dropdown box.
Fishing License Number - vessel's valid fishing license number
Fishing License Description - include type of species and any other relevant information regarding licensing
Fishing License Valid Until - select the date when the fishing license expires
INMARSAT Information - Mobile Satellite Number, Fax, Telephone, or E-mail
Add Vessel Button - Choose ‘Add Vessel' or ‘Add Vessel(s) via Lookup' to add multiple vessels
Remove Vessel Button- click this button to remove the current vessel

Once all necessary vessels for the grouping are added, click the ‘Submit Application' button, which is located at the left of your screen above the tab menu.
You will receive an email notification from the FCS to confirm submission of the application and another notification when your request is approved. Once a grouping is approved it can be used to create applications for Catch Certificate - Group-Based.
Buyer / Agent Grouping
If you purchase product from a buyer (intermediary), who had purchased product directly from vessels or purchased product from another buyer, you can create a vessel or community based grouping with a Buyer / Agent sub-type. (A buyer/agent may represent a processor, another exporter or harvester)
Each Buyer / Agent grouping can contain only 1 buyer / agent. If you have multiple buyer / agents, they will each require their own grouping.
Buyer / Agent Grouping Steps
Buyer/Agent Tab
Select ‘Create Application', and then select the Application Type: Catch Certificate - Request Grouping.
Group Detail Tab
You will see a screen displaying the Group Detail for this Catch Certificate - Request Grouping. Complete the Group Name and Group Alias fields, and then select ‘Buyer / Agent' as the grouping sub-type by clicking the circle next to ‘Buyer / Agent'.
Click on the Buyer / Agent tab and then click the ‘Add Buyer / Agent' button. The screen will refresh and provide you with fields to complete based on the company information. This is where you add the information of the company from which you purchase product(s).
Below is a screen capture of the details needed for the Buyer / Agent.

Note: There is no limit to the amount of vessels that you can add in a buyer/agent group.
Once all vessels have been added, click ‘Submit Application'.
You will receive an email notification from the FCS to confirm submission of the application and another notification when your request is approved. Once a grouping is approved it can be used to create applications for Catch Certificate - Group-Based.
Catch Certificate - Standard
This is an application for a European Community Catch Certificate, as published in Annex II of the EC Council Regulation (EC) no 1005/2008. This application form will require that each of the vessels involved in the catch be identified along with the vessel's relevant information. This type of catch certificate is the optimal method for applying for a catch certificate due to a higher level of traceability.
Notes on Standard Certificates:

A Catch Certificate - Standard is required for each catch landed by a vessel of over 100 feet (30.48m) in length.
Since more in-depth information about the vessel is required in a Catch Certificate - Standard, there is more traceability than in a Catch Certificate - Group-Based. The Catch Certificate - Standard method of applying for a catch certificate is the preferred method by the EU.
Only one vessel can be added to a Catch Certificate - Standard.

Catch Certificate - Standard: Steps
Select ‘Create Application', and then select the Application Type: Catch Certificate - Standard.
You will notice that the application for a Catch Certificate - Standard is broken down into a number tabs to make navigating through the application easier. 
Detail Tab
The following is a screen shot of this tab:
 

Application Description - this field is not mandatory. It is a free text field that allows users to create a description for the document for tracking and reference purposes. 
Exportation Date - enter the date the product(s) will be exported from Canada. 
Is the consignment intended for direct export to the European Community? 
                A direct export refers to products shipped from Canada directly to the European Union. For an indirect export, the products would be shipped from Canada to a third country before being exported to the European Union. 
Is this a transhipment?
                A transhipment refers to a consignment that is transferred to another vessel at sea or in a port, and continues to its final destination. 
Is the consignment intended for re-export from the European Community?
                Re-export from the European Community refers to a consignment exported to the European Union that would then be re-exported by that European country to a third party or another foreign country. 

Vessel Tab
This is the tab where you enter all vessels responsible for the catch that is being exported to the European Community. When adding vessels, it is more efficient to click ‘Add Vessel(s) via Lookup', which will open a window where you can search for vessels in the DFO database.
Vessel Lookup table:
  

Vessel Name - the registered name of the vessel
VRN - the Vessel Registration Number for the vessel
Region - DFO Regions include: Central and Arctic, Gulf, Maritimes, Newfoundland and Labrador, Pacific, and Quebec.

Multiple Vessels Displayed: 
When searching for a vessel, it is common that multiple vessels with the same name, VRN, and Region will be displayed. Multiple vessels are displayed because the FCS Vessel Lookup system extracts vessels from multiple databases at Fisheries and Oceans. It is acceptable to use any of these vessels as long as the Vessel Name, VRN, and Region match the vessel that you require.
Once you search and find the vessel that you need, click the ‘OK' button at the bottom-right of the window. This should refresh the screen and show the vessel, along with its associated information that has been extracted from the database. You then need to add the required vessel information in the remaining fields. It is encouraged that you add all known vessel information into each field. However, it is only mandatory, by EU regulations, to complete the blue fields.
A screen capture of the Vessel tab page is shown below.
  

Vessel Name - the registered name of the vessel
VRN - the Vessel Registration Number
Overall Length - the overall length of the vessel in meters
Flag - country where the vessel is registered
Home Port - the port from which the vessel operates from (This may or may not be the same location as where the catches are landed)
Call Sign - unique designation for a transmitting station, provided by Transport Canada
IMO Number - International Maritime Organization Number (ex. IMO 12345467)
Lloyds Number - Lloyds Register Number
Master Name - name of the master of the vessel
Authorized Processing Type on Board - select whether or not there is authorized processing on-board. If processing is able to be completed on board of the vessel, then select ‘Processing' from the dropdown box.
Fishing License Number - valid fishing license number
Fishing License Description - include type of species and any other relevant information regarding licensing
Fishing License Valid Until - select the date when the fishing license expires
INMARSAT Information - Mobile Satellite Number, Fax, Telephone, or E-mail
                Note: At least one INMARSAT field is required to be entered. The certificate will be approved without an INMARSAT number; however, there is a risk for potential detainment of the product exported if all the fields are left blank. 

Add Vessel Button - Choose ‘Add Vessel' or ‘Add Vessel(s) via Lookup' to add multiple vessels
Remove Vessel Button - click this button to remove the current vessel

Once all of the required vessel information has been entered, click on the Catch Tab.
Catch Tab
This tab will contain all information regarding the catch that has been made for the shipment.
The Catch tab appears as follows:
  

References of Management Measures - the application will default to ‘Fisheries Act' as the default management measure. Please contact the Operations Centre for more details on ‘US Legislation' and ‘Coastal Fisheries Protection Act'.
CFIA Certificate Number - Health certificate number as issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). If you do not know this number, you can use a plant number. It is recommended that you complete this field; however, it is not mandatory.
Add Species - the first step in the catch tab is to state the species that will be contained in your shipment. It is mandatory to add at least one species. 

Add Species and Catch Weights
Click the ‘Add Species' button. Once clicked there should be a ClaMS Item Lookup page that appears. This page allows you to search for a species using either a Taxonomic Serial Number (TSN) Code or a species description. Below is a screen shot of the ClaMS Item Lookup page.
  

TSN Code - Taxonomic Serial Number; coding system that provides structure to species names and their hierarchical classification. If you know the TSN Code for the species of product that you are shipping, type it in this field then press ‘Search'. If you do not know the TSN Code of your product, conduct the search using a species description. All TSN codes can be found at www.itis.gov. 
Description - Species description; enter the description of the species that you require. (ex. If you are shipping Lobster, type Lobster into this field and press 'Search')

Multiple species are likely to be displayed when conducting a species search, choose the species that is most appropriate.
Note: If you cannot find the species that you are looking for or you need assistance using the Lookup table, see Lookup Tables Help.
Once you have found the correct species, click on it within the table (it should highlight in blue), then click ‘OK'. The screen should refresh and the Species should be added within the Catch tab. For an example, Lobster will be the species used for the following explanations.

Once the species has been added from the lookup screen, the page should refresh and have lobster and the lobster TSN code in the species fields, and the weight fields will appear.

Estimated Live Weight (kg) - The approximate weight of the whole catch prior to any primary processing (i.e. before gutting).
Estimated Landing Weight (kg) - The estimated, unofficial weight of a catch as determined by the fish harvester.
                Note: If there is processing on-board this weight may change from the estimated live weight.

Verified Landing Weight (kg) - The official weight recorded by mechanisms at the time the catch is landed, such as a Dockside Monitoring Program.
                Note: For any live, whole product that is not processed (ex. lobster) and is being shipped, these 3 weights may be the same.

Applicable Conversion - a conversion factor used to convert weights after processing.
                Note: This is not a mandatory field and will not apply to every product.
This applicable conversion is used mainly when processing occurs. If you know the product weight that you are shipping, but do not have any estimated weight, you can use a conversion factor to estimate this weight. 
Example: If you are shipping clam tongues (no shell included in shipping) and you know that the clam tongues compose 12% of the total weight (including shell), then you can use this number to estimate the total catch weight. One method to figure out the estimated live and landing weights is as follows: If the product weight was 100kg, then you would have 100kg / 12% = 833 kg .

Add Species - click this button if you would like to add another species to the catch certificate. 
Remove Species - click this button if you need to remove the species
Catch Area - the location where the catch took place. There needs to be a minimum of one catch area added for each species.
Add Product -this is where you add the final product for shipment.

Add Catch Area
The next step is to click the ‘Add Catch Area' button, the page should refresh and there will now be fields where you can enter the area in which the catch was made. The following is a screen shot of the catch area Lookup page.


Management Area Abbrv - the abbreviation used for an area. This could be any type of number or letter code. For instance, the FAO Area for the Northeast Pacific is 67.
Management Area Description - the description of the catch zone
                Note: If you cannot find the catch area that you are looking for or you need assistance using the Lookup table, see Lookup Tables Help.
Note: It is encouraged that you choose the most specific catch zone possible. For instance, if you are catching product in the Atlantic, you need to put the NAFO area rather than the broad FAO area of 21.


Below is a map of catch zones in Canada and further information on the catch zones. The website link for these maps can be found at: http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/ccp-pcc/maps-eng.htm. A direct link to the catch zone website can also be found within the FCS system, in the Catch tab. 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Map of Major Fishing Areas (for more information go to http://www.fao.org/) Note: For catches from FAO area 21 the reporting must be made by North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) area defined below. 


North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) area.


Once you have selected the appropriate catch area, select it, and then press ‘OK'. The screen should refresh and show the catch area along with catch date fields.


Management Area - area where the product was caught.
                Note: if the product was caught in multiple catch areas, then select the ‘Add Catch Area' button, number 4 in the above diagram, to add the other areas.

Catch Start Date - This is where you enter the date of the start of the catch.
Catch End Date - This is where you enter the end date of the catch.
                Note: If the catch was made during a period exceeding 6 weeks, you must split the catch date ranges into 6 week periods (It is suggested that you split that catch dates by month). The reason that we suggest structuring the dates in this manner is because the EU may question shipments with very large catch date ranges since it shows lack of traceability. 

To add multiple catch areas or dates, you must click the ‘Add Catch Area' button, and then put in the other date ranges.

Example: You know that your shipment of lobster was caught by multiple fishing trips from September 2010 to December 2010 in NAFO area 4X. However, since you are not permitted to put this entire date range into the system, it is recommended that you add separate catch date ranges for each month. A screenshot of this example is shown below.

Add Product
The next step is to click the ‘Add Product' button, the page should refresh and there will now be fields where you can enter the product being. The following is a screen shot of the Product Lookup page.
 

HS Code - Harmonized System Codes. These codes are used to classify commodities, in this case, fisheries products. If you do not know the HS Code of your product, conduct the search using a product description.
Product Description - enter the description of the product you are shipping. (ex. If you are shipping Lobster, type Lobster into this field and press Search)

Multiple products are likely to be displayed when conducting a product search, choose the product that is most appropriate.
Note: If you cannot find the product that you are looking for or you need assistance using the Lookup table, see Lookup Tables Help.
Transshipment Tab
Note: Transshipment details do not have to be completed online through the Fisheries Certificate System. These details can be filled in by hand on a printed certificate after the certificate has been submitted and approved. Transshipment detail will not be certified by the validating authority.
Transshipment is the shipment of goods to an intermediate destination, and then from there to yet another destination, without being landed. For instance, this tab is necessary to be filled out if the catch is done by a vessel at sea, and then transferred to a different vessel at sea or in a port before it lands at its final destination.
If your consignment had been transshipped, click ‘Yes', then fill out the required information. Once ‘Yes' is selected, the fields below become available. A screenshot of the transshipment tab is found below.

If the transshipment is done at sea, fill in the top box that is titled ‘Transshipment at Sea'. If the transshipment was done in port, then fill in the second box that is titled ‘Transshipment Authorization with a Port'.
Transport Tab
Consignments intended for direct export to the EU
Enter transport information for the consignment that is being exported. This transport information should be that of the company that will be transporting your shipment to the EU.
Consignments not intended for direct export to the EU
If the consignment is not intended for direct export to the EU (meaning that the shipment is sent to a foreign country first, then it is exported to the EU from the foreign country), you need to put the transportation information of the company that is shipping your product to the foreign country. The transportation information for the company that is responsible for shipping the product to the EU will need to be added by the export company in the foreign country to a catch certificate Annex IV.
Import Tab
This tab is for entering contact information regarding the Importer that you are shipping to in the European Union.
If the consignment is intended for indirect export to the EU, you will need to complete the first question ‘What is the anticipated final market destination?'This is where you list the country within the EU that the shipment is ultimately intended to reach. 
Note: If you do not know the final market destination, then you can select the country that you are exporting to or ‘Unknown'.
Location and contact information will need to be completed on this tab; however there are also a few fields regarding importing that should be filled in if the information is known and relevant.
Importer Date - the date at which the shipment is imported
Product CN Code (Combined Nomenclature code) - This field contains the classification of the product in the tariff and statistical nomenclature, the Combined Nomenclature (CN), published in Annex 1 to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff. 
 Further Information Regarding CN Codes.
Re-Export Tab
Note: Re-export details do not have to be completed online through the Fisheries Certificate System. These details can be filled in by hand on a printed certificate after the certificate has been submitted and approved. The EU Re-Export Certificate will not be certified by the validating authority.
The Re-Export tab provides information required for an EU Re-Export Certificate. 
Re-exportation means any movement from the territory of the European Community of fishery products which had been previously imported into the territory of the European Community. Basically, this tab is filled out if the shipment is being imported by the European Union, and then re-exported to a country outside of the European Union.
If the consignment is intended for re-export from the European Community, click ‘Yes', then fill out the necessary information.
If you do not know the re-export information, but you do know that the product is being re-exported, simply click the ‘Yes' button and leave the fields blank to allow the importer in the EU to fill in this information.
Files Tab
This tab is used to attach any necessary files that you may need to be associated with the catch certificate. These files will remain on record within the FCS and will be attached to the catch certificate when printed. It should be noted that files are not added to catch certificates often, but the option is there if you are required to add a file.
Submit Application
Once all necessary information has been added to the certificate application, click the ‘Submit Application' button, which is located at the left of your screen above the tab menu.
You will receive an email notification from the FCS to confirm submission of the application and another notification when your request is approved.
See Service Standards for application approval times.
If you have any problems submitting an application, view the Submit Application Help Page.
Catch Certificate - Group-Based
This is a variation of the European Community catch certificate that accommodates situations where the catch is based on a pre-approved grouping (Before a Catch Certificate - Group-Based can be created, you must first create a grouping by applying for a ‘Catch Certificate - Request Grouping').
Catch Certificate - Group-Based: Steps
Select ‘Create Application', and then select the Application Type: Catch Certificate - Group Based
You will notice that the application for a Catch Certificate - Group-Based is broken down into a number tabs to make navigating through the application easier. 
Detail Tab
The following is a screen shot of this tab:


Application Description - this field is not mandatory. It is a free text field that allows users to create a description for the document for tracking and reference purposes.
Exportation Date - enter the date the product(s) will be exported from Canada.
Is the consignment intended for direct export to the European Community?
                A direct export refers to products shipped from Canada directly to the European Union. For an indirect export, the products would be shipped from Canada to a third country before being exported to the European Union.

Is this transshipment?
                Transshipment refers to a consignment that is transferred to another vessel at sea or in a port, and continues to its final destination.

Is the consignment intended for re-export from the European Community?
                Re-export from the European Community refers to a consignment exported to the European Union that would then be re-exported by that European country to a third party or another foreign country.


Group Tab
The Group tab contains the groupings that are available to be used by your company. These groupings must have been previously submitted and approved by the Operations Centre (See Catch Certificate - Request Grouping)
A screenshot of the Group tab is below.

The above example lists 3 groupings that have been approved and can be used for this catch certificate. 

View - To view the information within a grouping, such as vessels, communities, and buyers, click the view button for the desired group.
Selected - To select a grouping for this Catch Certificate - Group Based, click on desired box within the ‘Selected' column. You may select multiple groupings. You need to select the grouping(s) that contain the vessels or buyer(s) responsible for catching the product that will be exported.
Group Name
Group Alias
Group Type
Group Expiry Date - Lists the date at which time the group will expire.
Modify - You now have the ability to modify a grouping at the time of application for a Catch Certificate - Group-Based. To modify a grouping, select the ‘Modify' button for the desired grouping. When modify is selected, you will need to confirm that you would like to modify the grouping. Once confirmed, you will be able to modify the grouping by adding or removing up to 5 vessels or communities. 

Please refer to the section on Catch Certificate - Standard for instructions on how to complete the Catch, Transshipment, Transport, Import, Re-Export and Files tabs and instructions on how to submit the application.
For more detailed information, please contact the Operations Centre.
Catch Certificate - Foreign Export
This is an application for what is known as an Annex IV in the EU Regulation. This type of certificate is required for product that is imported by a Canadian company from a foreign country, and then exported from Canada to the European Community.
Catch Certificate - Foreign Export: Steps
Select ‘Create Application' from the Navigation Menu, and then select the Application Type: Catch Certificate - Foreign Export
Plant Tab
This is where you enter the detailed information regarding your processing plant. If you are simply purchasing product from a foreign country, then importing it without processing, then enter your company information on this tab. 
All fields are mandatory in this tab.
Products Tab
This is where you select the final product that you are shipping. Click the ‘Lookup' button to select the product. The lookup page will be displayed as follows.
 

HS Code - Harmonized System Codes. These codes are used to classify commodities, in this case, fisheries products. If you do not know the HS Code of your product, conduct the search using a product description.
Product Description - enter the description of the product you are shipping. (ex. If you are shipping Lobster, type Lobster into this field and press Search)

Multiple products are likely to be displayed when conducting a product search, choose the product that is most appropriate.
Note: If you cannot find the product that you are looking for or you need assistance using the Lookup table, see Lookup Tables Help .
If you are shipping more than one product, you can add more product types by click the button ‘Add Products'. A minimum of one product is mandatory and each product will be displayed in the Product Table.
Certificates Tab
This is the tab where you add any foreign certificates that you have received from exporters that apply to your shipment. Click the ‘Add Certificate' button to enter certificate information. A minimum of one certificate is mandatory. Below is a screen capture of the certificate tab:

Manage Documents
The Manage Documents section allows you to access all applications, certificates, and groupings that you have created. You can view documents that you are working on, documents that you submitted, and also documents that have been approved and are now stored in the FCS.
Manage documents is the second button in the Navigation Menu at the top of your screen, as seen in the screen shot below.

To access documents within the Manage Documents section, place your mouse over the ‘Manage Documents' heading, then select from one of the options that appear below.

Applications - This section contains all applications that you are working on or have submitted. There are no approved certificates or groupings in this section.
Certificates - This section contains all catch certificates that have been validated and approved. This is the section where you will locate the catch certificates that you will use for exporting.
Groupings - This section contains all grouping requests that have been validated and approved. This section will list the groupings that you can use for Catch Certificate - Group-Based applications.
Forwarded Certificates - This section contains all certificates that have been forwarded to another company. Both companies must be registered within the FCS in order to forward certificates. These certificates are used in the case where one company has created a certificate that another company who purchased from them may need.
Document Search - This section allows you to search all documents related to your company within the Fisheries Certificate System

Applications
Click ‘Manage Documents', then click ‘Applications'. The system should bring you to an application page that will be displayed as follows:

The Application Criteria box at the top allows you to quickly locate the application that you are seeking. This is especially useful when you have a large number of applications in the FCS.
Applicant Name - This dropdown box should be automatically set to your company name. Choose this dropdown button and select the desired company to view applications for that company.
Application Type - This dropdown box allows you to filter applications by choosing a specific application type. The following is a list of all possible application types:
Types of Applications

Catch Certificate - Request Grouping: application for a user to create groupings (i.e. of vessels or buyers) within the FCS.
Catch Certificate - Standard: This is an application for a European Community Catch Certificate, as published in Annex II of the EU Council Regulation (EC) no 1005/2008. 
Catch Certificate - Group Based: This is a variation of the European Community Catch Certificate that accommodates situations where the catch is based on a pre-approved grouping.
Catch Certificate - Foreign Export: This type of certificate is required for product that is imported by a Canadian company from a foreign country, and then exported from Canada to the European Community.

More details about types of applications can be found here in the Application Section.
Application Status
Choose this dropdown box to filter applications based on Application Status. The following is a list of all possible application status types.
Interim- An application that has been created, which has not yet been submitted to DFO for validation/approval. Interim applications can be saved and edited until the Applicant is ready to submit. 
For instance, if you are working on an application, but do not have time to finish, if you save the application to work on later, it will be as Interim status. Also, since the application automatically saves every time you select a different tab when you are filling out the information, if you get disconnected from the FCS for whatever reason, all of your work on the application should still be saved and can be accessed as Interim.
Submitted- This is when an application, which was previously in Interim status, has been submitted to the Program for validation and approval. This type of application can no longer be edited. 
Validating- The application is currently being validated by the Program. An application can only be validated after it is submitted.
Recommendation - This means that a recommendation has been made by a Certification Officer for further review. An example of when this might occur would be if a species is red flagged or it is exempted from the regulation. This status is very similar to submitted because it means that the application cannot be edited and can still be approved or declined.
Declined- The Program has validated and declined the application.
Cancelled - This application has been cancelled and can no longer be submitted. The application will remain in the list of applications, but can no longer be edited or submitted. It is left in the list for your reference.

Select Application
For the following functions, you will need to select applications. To select an application, click on it within the application list. The application should highlight in blue, which shows that you have properly selected the application. An example is below:

Headings are denoted from point 7 to 16

New - Create a newapplication by clicking on the ‘New' icon. The system will display the Create Applicationpage. To view instructions on how to create a new application, please refer to Create Application.
Edit Application - Edit an existing application by selecting the application of interest and then clicking on the ‘Edit' icon. Only applications that are in an Interim status can be edited. Once an application has been submitted to the Operations Centre, it cannot be edited.
                The edit page is identical to the page that is used to initially create an application. You can add/remove information, and then submit the application.
For more information and instruction about editing/creating a certificate, click Application Types, then find the appropriate application and click the instructional link. 

View - View application details by clicking on the record and then clicking on the ‘View' icon. This will bring up a screen similar to the edit screen; however, you will only be able to review the information.
Cancel - Select an application then press the ‘Cancel' button to cancel the application. A cancelled application can no longer be edited or submitted.
Export - Select an application then click ‘Export' button to export the application listing to an excel spreadsheet.
Print - Select an application then click the ‘Print' button to produce a report in a Portable Document Format (PDF). (Adobe Reader is required to view reports in PDF. Adobe Reader may be downloaded free at: http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/ )
ID - this is a unique ID assigned to each application within the FCS.
Applicant Name - displays the name of your company
Application Type
Application Method - the method used to create an application. The methods for applications can be found under the section Application Method. The most common and efficient type of application method is On-Line form.
Application Status - the status of an application as previously discussed, more detailed information can be found here.
Document ID - A unique application record number assigned by FCS when the record is created.
Submitted Date - The date at which the application was submitted.
Submitted by - the user in your company that submitted the application
Service Standard Target Date - the date when the certificate will be validated by a Certification Officer at the Operations Centre.
Assigned Validator - (not shown in the above screen shot) the assigned validator is the Program's Certification Officer responsible for the submitted applications.

Certificates
Click ‘Manage Documents', then click ‘Certificates'. The system should bring you to a certificates page that will be displayed as follows:


View - View certificate details by clicking on the record and then clicking on the ‘View' icon. This will bring up a screen similar to the edit screen; however, you will only be able to review the information.
Copy Certificate - Select this option if you wish to create a new catch certificate based on an existing certificate that you have previously created. This method will create efficiencies when creating a new catch certificate because you will not have to enter the same information that you have previously entered in the first catch certificate.
                To copy a certificate, select a certificate from the certificate list, and then choose ‘Copy'. When you copy a certificate, the information in the certificate will remain identical to the original. However, the weight fields and catch date fields will have to be entered in the Catch tab. 

Export - Select an application then click the ‘Export' button to export the application listing to an excel spreadsheet.
Print Certificate - Select an application then click the ‘Print' button to access a copy of your actual catch certificate. The catch certificate is in a Portable Document Format (PDF) and you will be given the option to either open or save the certificate to your computer hard drive. (This button may be misleading because it does not actually print the certificate once clicked, it simply gives you the option to open or save it. Once saved or opened, it can then be printed, if necessary.)]
                Below is a screen capture of the window that the print button will open.

It should be noted that accessing a certificate through the ‘Print' button has a very long load time relative to other functions within the FCS. It can sometimes take one to two minutes for a certificate to load once the ‘Print' button has been clicked. (Clicking on other functions within the system while this document is downloading will cause the download to stop)
Note: A common problem when users are trying to obtain a catch certificate is that some users have either a popup blocker enabled or a download blocker enabled. Users will need to disable their popup blocker to allow the internet browser access to download the file. If you still cannot obtain a certificate even after the popup blocker has been disabled, contact our office and we will be able to send you a certificate.
Below is a common example of a popup blocker.

The popup blocker will display a bar across the top of your browser. To download the file, click on this bar and select ‘Download File'. You may need to click the ‘Print' button again to download the catch certificate file once you have disabled your popup blocker.
The next step after obtaining your catch certificate is to give this certificate to your importer. You can print this certificate and send it with your consignment, or send it electronically to your importer, or fax it to your importer. 

Reissue Certificate - Choose the ‘Reissue' button if you would like to alter a previously approved certificate that may have incorrect information. The only information fields that are able to be edited on a reissue are:
                
Weight fields - You are able to lower weights if you incorrectly put in higher weight than what is actually being shipped or if the weight requirement for a shipment is lowered after you have already had a certificate approve. Weights can only be lowered, you are never able to increase the amount of weight listed on a certificate after it has been approved. 
Tabs that are not certified by the validating authority. These tabs include Transshipment, Re-Export, and Files.

Since all other information has been validated, it can no longer be changed on the catch certificate. Once the necessary changes are complete within the certificate, you will need to select ‘Submit Application'. Once submitted, the new certificate application will be automatically approved and available within your certificate list.

The screen capture above shows the original certificate and the new certificate within the certificate list. The original certificate now has a status of Consolidated/Reissued and can no longer be edited. The newly created certificate will have a status of Approved.

Forward Certificate - your company has the ability to forward a certificate to another company (within the FCS) if necessary. The most common use of forwarding will occur when the company that has originally created the catch certificate has sold their product to another company before exportation to the EU. It is now the second company that requires a catch certificate, not the company that initially created the certificate.
                 To forward a certificate to another company, click on the appropriate catch certificate from the certificate list, then press ‘Forward'. A new screen will become available that will allow you to choose the company (from a list of companies registered within the FCS) that you wish to forward the certificate to. A screen capture of this screen is below:

Once you have selected the desired company, press the ‘Forward Certificate' button. Once you forward the certificate, you will be brought back to the certificate list. Forwarded certificates can no longer be Printed, Reissued, or Forwarded by your company. 
Below is a screen capture of the certificate list along with the functions that are still available to the certificate.

The items circled in red are the only functions that are still available for the certificate that has been forwarded.
Once you forward a certificate, the receiving company will now have the certificate show up within their Certificates list.
It is likely that the receiving company will consolidate this certificate with a certificate of their own.

Recall - select this option if you wish to recall a certificate that has been previously forwarded. Recalling a certificate will give you full access to the certificate's functions, such as Print, Reissue, and the option to Forward again if necessary. Recalling basically brings back a forwarded certificate so that you can use it like any other approved certificate.

Consolidating Catch Certificates
It should be noted that consolidating certificates is not a common occurrence and will usually only take place when many certificates are used for one shipment or in the case where a company has received a forwarded certificate from another company within the FCS that need to be combined into one certificate for a shipment.
Individual approved catch certificates can be consolidated into a single catch certificate by clicking on this option. A consolidated catch certificate does not have to be submitted to the Operations Centre for validation as it can only be created using existing approved certificates and information already stored within the FCS system.
Steps for Consolidation
Select ‘Create Application' from the Navigation Menu, in the Create Application window, select ‘Consolidate from Existing Certificates' from the Application Method section.
For further assistance with regards to consolidation, please contact the Operations Centre.
Applicants/Exporters
This page displays the detailed information for an FCS user. This section of the FCS allows users to access their accounts and for managers to add/edit user accounts within their company. Clicking on Applicants/Exporters > Applicant Users will open a window listing all users within your company. In this screen you can create new users for your company, edit current users, view user information, enable/disable a user, and export user information into an excel spreadsheet.
Add New User / Edit User Information
To create a new user or edit an existing user, select ‘New' or select an applicant and then select ‘Edit'. The following screen should appear:

PAA 
      announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.55 per common unit ($2.20

      distribution paid in May 2017. Additionally, PAA announced a 
      payment-in-kind (“PIK”) of the quarterly distribution with respect to 
      its Series A Preferred Units, which will result in the issuance of an 
      additional 1,339,796 Series A Preferred Units. The PIK amount equates to 
      a quarterly distribution of $0.525 per Series A Preferred Unit, or $2.10 
      annualized.

      ($2.20 per Class A share on an annualized basis), which is unchanged 
      from the quarterly distribution paid in May 2017.

      natural gas and refined products. PAA owns an extensive network of 
      pipeline transportation, terminalling, storage and gathering assets in 
      key crude oil and NGL producing basins and transportation corridors and

      handles over 4.7 million barrels per day of crude oil and NGL in its 
      Transportation segment. PAA is headquartered in Houston, Texas. More 
      information is available at www.plainsallamerican.com.
