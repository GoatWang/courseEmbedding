Fitch Rates Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2012-5, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2012-5 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2012-5, Mortgage Pass-Through 
      Certificates, Series 2012-5
    





October 30, 2012 11:58 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2012-5, mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2012-5 (SEMT 2012-5):
    

      --$296,954,000 class A certificates 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$296,954,000 notional class A-IO certificates 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$8,488,000 class B-1 certificates 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$5,286,000 class B-2 certificates 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$3,684,000 class B-3 certificates 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$2,563,000 class B-4 certificates 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 7.30% 
      subordination provided by the 2.65% class B-1, 1.65% class B-2, 1.15% 
      class B-3, 0.80% non-offered class B-4 and 1.05% non-offered class B-5. 
      The class B-5 is not rated by Fitch.
    

      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the strong historical performance of the highest contributing originator 
      to the aggregate pool (First Republic Bank, 24.46%), the clear capital 
      structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by third party 
      underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will act as the master 
      servicer and Christiana Trust will act as the Trustee for the 
      transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made to 
      treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage investment conduits 
      (REMICs).
    

      SEMT 2012-5 will be Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation's fifth 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2012. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime mortgage loans, with 100% fixed rate 
      mortgages (FRMs). The loans are predominantly fully amortizing; however, 
      4.9% have a 10-year interest-only (IO) period. The aggregate pool 
      included loans originated by First Republic Bank (24.5%), PrimeLending 
      (17%), Flagstar Bank, F.S.B. (9.3%), and Cornerstone Mortgage (6.1%). 
      The remainder of the mortgage loans (43.1%) was originated by various 
      mortgage lending institutions, each of which contributed less than 5% to 
      the transaction.
    

      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 390 loans with a 
      total balance of $320,339,050, an average balance of $821,382, a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 68.4%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 4.2%. Rate/term and cash out 
      refinances account for 45.7% and 8.4% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 770. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 94.3% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (44%), 
      Texas (13.4%) and Washington (5.8%).
    

      Additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue 
      report 'Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2012-5'.
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.
    

      In addition to the information sources identified in Fitch's criteria 
      listed below, Fitch's analysis incorporated data tapes, due diligence 
      results, deal structure and legal documents from the 17g5 website

Kroll Bond Rating Agency Affirms Ratings on Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2012-4 Certificates | Business Wire
























































Kroll Bond Rating Agency Affirms Ratings on Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2012-4 Certificates






September 24, 2013 05:50 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) affirms six classes of mortgage 
      pass-through certificates from Sequoia Mortgage Trust (SEMT) 2012-4, a 
      jumbo prime RMBS transaction (see ratings listed below).
    


      The SEMT 2012-4 mortgage pool has experienced no losses and minimal 
      delinquencies since issuance. As of the August 25th 
      remittance, there is one 30-day delinquent loan with a balance of $521 
      thousand, representing 0.22% of the current pool size. Additionally, 
      principal payments on the pool have resulted in increased credit 
      enhancement to each of the rated classes. KBRA’s analysis of home price 
      trends indicate that the mortgage pool also benefits from home prices 
      which on average have risen since issuance.
    

      For more information on SEMT 2012-4, please see our report, “Sequoia 
      Mortgage Trust Q2 Comprehensive Surveillance Report (SEMT 2010-H1 to 
      SEMT 2012-6)”, which was published on July 17, 2013 at www.krollbondratings.com.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
