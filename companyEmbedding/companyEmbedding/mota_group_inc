The group expects total spending to reach $18.9 billion.That’s a lot for traditional sweets and treats often devoured by night’s end.

Gov. Brown vetoed a bill we helped oppose which would have restricted drone flight. His veto message says it would have caused “significant regulatory confusion by creating a patchwork of federal, state, and local restrictions on airspace.” We support clear rules for drone operation that everyone can understand and follow.

We followed it with six more recreational and commercial drones. They’ve earned “best of” press coverage at events like CES Las Vegas, CES Asia, and Toy Fair. Commercial drones are generating buzz for their efficiency, cost reduction and safety; recreational ones because they’re “just plain fun to fly” as WIRED magazine called our Nano. We’re housing them under the widely recognized MOTA brand to jumpstart them into a worldwide market Goldman Sachs predicts will zoom to $38 billion by 2020.Innovation Meets Style: TAMOWe’ve rolled our consumer electronics for mobile users into their own brand, TAMO, to better reflect their combination of engineering innovation and a fresh, stylish look. In the first half of 2016 we introduced several new CE products, among them Apple-certified extra-long Lightning cables in the very latest colors and a pair of powerful, ultra-slim battery cases for the Galaxy S7 / S7 edge.We’re hard at work on bringing you exciting new drones and consumer electronics.

Investing in an IPO is subject to unique risks, tolerance for volatility, and potential loss of principal, that customers should be aware of prior to making an investment decision. 
        Motif cannot guarantee the availability of IPO shares for customers, who submit conditional orders as the number of shares requested for distribution may exceed the supply.
        Important information concerning IPO participation is contained in the Terms and Conditions for IPO Participation.
There are additional risks to consider with Small-Company IPO, secondary offerings, and Regulation A+ offerings including risks of unproven management, companies that may have
        substantial debt, lack of profitable financial performance, dilution of share value to existing shareholders, liquidity of shares in the marketplace, regulatory uncertainty,
        and exchange-listing requirements. As with any investment decision you make at Motif, you are responsible for determining whether an investment in an initial public offering,

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock
and warrants we are offering will be approximately $6,045,000, based upon the
public offering price of $9.99 per share and $0.01 per warrant set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus. If the underwriters fully exercise the
over-allotment option, we estimate the net proceeds of the common stock and
warrants we sell will be approximately $6,951,750. “Net proceeds” is what we
expect to receive after paying the underwriting discount and other expenses of
the offering.

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the initial public offering price of $9.99 per
share and $0.01 per warrant would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us
from this offering by approximately $604,500, assuming the number of shares
offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the
same and after deducting underwriter discounts and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to increase production, for
working capital, and for other general corporate purposes, including, but not
limited to, financing our growth, enhancing and improving our products and
solutions, diversifying our customer base, enhancing our sales/marketing
infrastructure, funding capital expenditures, cost-cutting activities,
including, but not limited to, business automation, decrease in shipment costs,
repayment or refinancing of higher interest debt, and outsourcing our logistics
to reduce overall expenses, expanding our existing business through investments
in or acquisitions of other businesses, solutions, or technologies. Our actual
allocation might differ from the list above and we do not have specific
acquisition target at this time. Potential acquisitions will be considered on
the basis of customer-relationships, and proprietary technology. Except for the
repayment of $983,965 senior secured redeemable debenture, we have no specific
plans for the proceeds of the offering.

Until we use the net proceeds of the offering, we will invest the funds in
short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities, or in savings
accounts. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds to us from this offering and investors will be relying on the
judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds.


Our industry is characterized by intense competition, supply shortages or
oversupply, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, declining
average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for our
products and services include customer loyalty, “coolness” and “buzz,” product
performance, features, acquisition cost, and lifetime operating cost, including
maintenance and support, ease of use, integration with existing equipment,
quality, reliability, customer support, brand and reputation.

The market for drones/UAS is evolving rapidly and subject to changing
technologies, shifting customer needs and expectations and the potential
introduction of new products. We believe that a number of established domestic
and international defense contractors have developed or are developing
drones/UAS that have and will continue to compete directly with our products.
These competitors may have significantly more financial and other resources than
us. Our current principal drone/small UAS competitors include 3DR, DJI, Parrot,
Yuneec, and potentially GoPro, some of which have longer operating history and
greater name recognition, may have substantially greater financial, technical,
marketing and other resources. As a result, these competitors may be able to
better absorb price declines, ensure more stable supply, adapt more quickly to
new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the promotion and
sale of their products than us. Ultimately, this may lead to a decrease in our
sales and market share and have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We do not view large UAS manufacturers such as AAI Corporation, AeroVironment,
General Atomics, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and The Boeing Company as direct
competitors because they are weapons and extended-flight surveillance platforms,
tend to be much higher priced, and are not hand launched and locally controlled.
We cannot be certain that these platforms may not be direct competitors in the
future.

In our consumer electronics markets, we expect to face competition from existing
or future competitors that design and market similar or alternative products
that may be less costly and/or provide additional features. If a manufacturer of
consumer electronics products develops products with similar features, our
revenues would decline, which would result in a material adverse effect on or
business.


Company Description
We design, manufacture and market consumer products — including recreational and
commercial drones, smart wearables and innovative mobile accessories for
smartphone and camera users. We try to identify opportunities where users can
benefit from new technology, identify the gaps and areas that can


 be simplified
and enhanced, and develop these opportunities into products. Since 2012, we have
sold and shipped over 1.7 million units of our products to consumers worldwide.

Mota Group has two principal divisions:

• MOTA — Develops, manufactures and markets recreational and commercial drones
  and other unmanned aerial systems, also known as unmanned aircraft systems or
  UASs. We have two lines of drones: recreational (consumer) drones (under our
  JETJAT brand) and UAS platforms for commercial applications (under our Pro
  Live and GIGA brands). Many of our drones are capable of delivering real-time
  video, automatic control, tracking and geographic data, which increases
  flexibility in planning and execution.    

• TAMO — Designs, manufactures and markets stylish wearables, including
  smartwear, virtual reality products, portable power products and mobile    
  accessories.                                                               

Our operations are substantially integrated — we start with an idea; we engage
in the design process either in-house or in conjunction with third parties; we
manufacture our products in outsourced factories, most of which are in China;
and we distribute them both from third-party and in-house fulfillment centers
and through major retail, e-commerce, and independent dealers throughout North
America (and soon Europe and Latin America). Our integrated development process
allows us to focus on product quality, cost, timeliness, marketing and customers
for the entire commercialization cycle. Since our founding in 2003, we have
streamlined our operations to enable us to rapidly deliver advanced, innovative
solutions that are also easy to use and fun.

Our Existing Drone Products

Recreational Drones. In our recreational drone line, our JETJAT Nano series
drones bring the thrill of flight to almost everyone anywhere. Our JETJAT®
ULTRATM drone, for example, which has a built-in streaming camera yet fits in
the palm of your hand, can create indelible family memories, much like the first
Kodak cameras, with the ability to record personal events from vantage points
never before possible and stream them to the phone and internet. It provides
novel capabilities for our NanoTM Series, such as live streaming video to a
smartphone and throw-to-fly, along with ease-of-use features such as one-touch
take-off that are designed to elicit consumer interest in our drones, some of
which are smaller than a golf ball. Current retail prices for our recreational
drones range from $40 to $130.

Professional and Commercial Drones. Our highly versatile commercial drones are
adaptable for specialized applications including construction, agriculture,
energy, cinematography, real-estate marketing, sports training, warehouse, movie
production, aerospace and defense, and many others. Current retail prices for
our commercial drones range from $200 to $1,000.

Composite Score:





                        Mota Group, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
