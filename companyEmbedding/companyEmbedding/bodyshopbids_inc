Technology can overhaul a product or service that hasn't changed in decades or longer. That update may even transform the way entrepreneurs do business. Brad Weisberg, founder and CEO of BodyShopBids Inc., in Chicago, Ill. (www.bodyshopbids.com), uses technology to revolutionize the car repair bidding process for insurers and consumers. Opening in 2010 with $300,000 from an incubator, Weisberg set out to simplify the bid process by having customers send Smartphone photos to his site to obtain bids. Three venture capital firms subsequently invested $1 million. A second entrepreneur developed European prototypes of innersprings for mattresses to increase comfort. In 2006, with an investor's $5,000, president and CEO Susanne Flother of Somnium Inc., in Venice, Calif. (www.somniumbeds.com), began developing and patenting the technology. The investor added $15,000 before a second one brought $600,000. Wholesale sales began in 2006. BUMPS Principals at Somnium tried every angle to sell their washable, recyclable, lighter product. Exploring several niches, they found the product too complex, even for mattress stores. They tried doctors and chiropractors, who referred, one at a time. Nothing sufficiently jump-started sales. How could they make the unusual fit in a stodgy market? Exhausted and frustrated, they couldn't reach enough people. They exhibited at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York. "We finally were seen by people who understood the product," Flother says. "It was phenomenal ... very, very exciting to see people enjoy the product and understand it." Now the mattresses sell in 30 fine furniture stores. BodyShopBids landed in a pothole early on, with insufficient revenue to meet payroll. Weisberg lost sleep the night before he planned to take action. "It was the most nerve-wracking thing I ever had to do," he remarks. "I had four employees and we were essentially out of money. "I brought everyone into the room, sat them down and told them," he continues. "I felt sick to my stomach. I told them about my vision of the future ? to help businesses and people." The contract for the first million dollars arrived in two weeks. With family around him, Weisberg signed it and felt validated by the hugs and photo-taking. Back at the office, he paid the three employees. An email from someone in the industry prompted Weisberg to expand beyond in-shop upgrades, such as oil changes and tire rotations. He learned that speeding up the claims process would save insurers an average of $200 per day and that he needed to be open to new ways of offering his service. The savings would also translate into happy clients for insurers. He expects last year's $20,000 gross revenue to grow to $250,000 in 2012. Flother learned that unusual products move best when represented by their entrepreneurs, although the website helps. "When you have many things to talk about," she says, "the challenge is to come up with the one that will resonate the most." Last year's revenue reached $600,000.
