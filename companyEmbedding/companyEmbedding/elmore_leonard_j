****Elmore is Buried Today on His Birthday

Today would have been Elmore’s 91st Birthday..  What makes this birthday different, it is the day he is finally buried.  Elmore died over three years ago, on August 20, 2013, but it was his wish to be buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Birmingham, Michigan, a little over a mile from his house in Bloomfield Township. It took three years, but Greenwood finally opened up new plots, allowing Elmore to have his wish and be buried there.
Elmore’s ashes were interred at 10:30 AM this morning, in a brief ceremony lead in prayer by Monsignor John P. Zenz, Pastor of Holy Name Church in Birmingham.  In attendance, under a red canopy, were several members of Elmore’s family.
Elmore grave marker gives his name and the years of his birth and death.  At the bottom, is the inscription, “The Dickens of Detroit,” a phrase used to describe Elmore over the years that he actually found a bit puzzling.  In a 1997 article in the San Jose Mercury News, he said about the tag: “That has more to do with alliteration than truth, … I wonder what they would have called me if I was from Buffalo.”
For those of you planning a visit, Elmore is buried in Section G, Lot R, Grave 2.

****The Enduring Appeal Of Elmore Leonard and Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens
Crimespree
Richard Godwin
Elmore Leonard wrote some of the classic crime novels of the twentieth century. Notably inspired by Higgins’s THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE, (1972), Leonard was an adept dialogue writer and master of the tight scene. I’ll use Leonard’s character Raylan Givens, one of his great characters, to exemplify his use of the Western inside the body of crime fiction.
Raylan Givens first appeared in Elmore Leonard’s novel PRONTO (1993). His short story “Fire in the Hole” (2012) then became the basis for the television series Justified. He also appeared in the novels RIDING THE RAP (1995) and RAYLAN (2012), Leonard’s final work, from which several plot lines were adapted by the writers of Justified. Raylan is described as forty years old, thin, and almost perpetually wearing a cowboy hat. With his laconic style and old-fashioned views, he occupies a position somewhere between a modern law enforcer and a Western cowboy. But most of all he is a hard enforcer of the law.

****EPIX® Reimagines  ‘Get Shorty’ for Television Produced by MGM Television
Produced by MGM Television, the Original Series is a Dark Comedy Slated to Start Production Fall 2016
May 24, 2016 05:09 PM Eastern Daylight Time
NEW YORK—(BUSINESS WIRE)—Premium TV network EPIX® announced today it will go into production on Get Shorty from MGM Television. Created and executive produced by Davey Holmes (“Shameless,” “In Treatment,” “Damages”), the one hour drama series is a reimagining of Elmore Leonard’s 1990 New York Times best-selling novel of the same name. Production on the series is anticipated to begin this fall and air summer 2017.
“We’re excited to be working with MGM on Get Shorty”
Tweet this
In Get Shorty, Miles Daly works as muscle for a murderous crime ring in Nevada. For the sake of his daughter, he attempts to change professions and become a movie producer, laundering money through a Hollywood film. But instead of leaving the criminal world behind, he accidentally brings it with him to Los Angeles.
“We’re excited to be working with MGM on Get Shorty,” said Mark S. Greenberg, President and CEO, EPIX. “I had the pleasure of working with Elmore Leonard early in my career and I am a big fan of his writing. Davey Holmes is a tremendous talent and has created a fantastic new series that is in the spirit of Leonard’s unique brand of social satire and strong narrative voice. Get Shorty promises to be yet another example of the type of high-end, premium TV that EPIX is committed to delivering to its subscribers.”
“Davey has created a modern-day re-envisioning of Elmore Leonard’s timeless cult classic where organized crime and Hollywood collide in very funny ways. We are thrilled to bring these irreverent characters to fans and audiences around the globe with our fantastic partners at EPIX,” said Mark Burnett, President, Television and Digital Group, MGM and Steve Stark, President, Television Development and Production, MGM.


****Author Jim Harrison dead at 78

The Washington Post
By Hillel Italie 
(Jim and Elmore were good friends.)

NEW YORK — Jim Harrison, the fiction writer, poet, outdoorsman and reveler who wrote with gruff affection for the country’s landscape and rural life and enjoyed mainstream success in middle age with his historical saga “Legends of the Fall,” has died at age 78.
Spokeswoman Deb Seager of Grove Atlantic, Harrison’s publisher, told The Associated Press that Harrison died Saturday at his home in Patagonia, Arizona. Seager did not know the cause of death. Harrison’s wife of more than 50 years, Linda King Harrison, died last fall.
The versatile and prolific author completed more than 30 books, most recently the novella collection “The Ancient Minstrel,” and was admired worldwide. Sometimes likened to Ernest Hemingway for the range and kinds of his interests, he was a hunter and fisherman who savored his time in a cabin near his Michigan hometown, a drinker and Hollywood scriptwriter who was close friends with Jack Nicholson and came to know Sean Connery, Orson Welles and Warren Beatty among others. He was a sports writer and a man of extraordinary appetite who once polished off a 37-course lunch, a traveler and teller of tales, most famously “Legends of the Fall.”

****James O. Born Interviewed for Elmore Leonard Documentary


Author Jim Born Interviewed for Elmore Leonard: The Dickens of Detroit Documentary in Miami
MIAMI - Feb 29, 2016—For more than seventeen years with the U.S. Marshals Service, DEA, and Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Jim Born has seen just about everything Florida crime and criminals can throw at him. Elmore Leonard first met Jim Born when he was a DEA agent stationed in South Florida. Jim’s dad, Judge John Born was friends with Leonard’s close friend Judge Marvin Mounts. Jim gave Leonard technical advice on a number of books starting with Get Shorty.

****James W. Hall Interviewed for Elmore Leonard Documentary

James W. Hall interviewed by John Mulholland in Key Largo for the upcoming Elmore Leonard Documentary—The Dickens of Detroit. Hall is an American author and professor who has written eighteen novels that include Under Cover of Daylight, Hard Aground, Gone Wild, Buzz Cut, Red Sky at Night, Rough Draft, Off the Chart and Silencer.
 


****Mike Sandy aka Max Cherry Interviewed for Elmore Leonard documentary

Max Cherry from Rum Punch was modeled on 
West Palm Beach Bail Bondsman Mike Sandy
Mike Sandy, a West Palm bail bondsman, remembers meeting Elmore Leonard in the late ’80s.
“Marvin Mounts and Dutch Leonard walked into my office,” said Sandy. “My office was on Banyan, and he was just finishing ‘Maximum Bob.’ Dutch was interested in doing a book about a bail bondsman and said, ‘Can I ask for your help?’ And I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ “He was a little startled and said, ‘Why not?’
“Because everything I’ve ever seen, heard or read about bail bondsmen is negative and I don’t want to contribute to that.”
“I’ll make you a deal,” he said. “Share your files with me, and I promise you that whatever I write about your business will be positive.”
Leonard began borrowing files from Sandy, one of which involved a stewardess arrested for drug trafficking. From that came “Rum Punch,” later made into the movie “Jackie Brown” by Quentin Tarantino.

Browse  Featured Authors  Elmore Leonard










​Elmore Leonard wrote 45 novels and nearly as many Western and crime short stories across his highly successful career, which spanned more than six decades. Some of his bestsellers include Road Dogs, Up in Honey’s Room, The Hot Kid, Mr. Paradise, Tishomingo Blues, and the critically acclaimed collection of short stories Fire in the Hole. Many of his books have been made into movies, including Get Shorty, Out of Sight, and Rum Punch, which became Quentin Tarantino’s Jackie Brown. Justified, the hit series from FX, is based on Leonard’s character Raylan Givens, who appears in Riding the Rap, Pronto, Raylan and the short story Fire in the Hole. Leonard was a recipient of the National Book Foundation’s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the Lifetime Achievement Award from PEN USA, and the Grand Master Award of the Mystery Writers of America. He was known to many as the “Dickens of Detroit” and was a longtime resident of the Detroit area. He passed away in 2013.

Top positive reviewSee all 42 positive reviews› 5.0 out of 5 starsOne of Elmore Leonard's greatest booksByRobert Mooreon August 20, 2008KILLSHOT is Elmore Leonard at his very best.  The story of a married couple being stalked by two would be killers -- a veteran hit man and an out-of-control punk -- is, like all of Leonard's books, not as interesting for the story as in the way he executes it.  Like Hammett and Chandler, Leonard is less concerned with plot than setting, character, detail, texture, and conversation.  The typical Leonard book leaves you with multiple unforgettable scenes, dialogue that won't leave your imagination, and images that you can't let go of.I always find myself reading Leonard on two levels.  On one level there is the story at hand.  On the other level I find myself marveling at the host of wonderful tricks he employs in telling that story.  His prose moves along effortlessly.  For instance, at one point the two bad guys are traveling to the house of the people they want to kill.  Instead of a long, mildly involved sentence or set of sentences to get them to it, Leonard merely writes, "And there is was."  It is a breathtakingly effective means to get from Point A to Point B.  In his famous Ten Rules for writing Leonard states that one of the keys to good writing is to cut out all the boring parts.  That simple sentence illustrates it as well as anyone.  Leonard's books are, in addition to being great yarns, instruction manuals on how to write effective stories.In talking to people about Leonard, I find that many tend to read books like the paired books GET SHORTY and BE COOL.  These are fine, but they are far from his best.  For that, I would recommend KILLSHOT, SWAG, and LaBRAVA, along with the Western HOMBRE.  There are other books that are probably their equal, but you won't find any better.

Top critical reviewSee all 14 critical reviews› 3.0 out of 5 starsWonderful writing but print quality of this book inferiorByD. J. Ralstonon August 26, 2013The novel is excellent but I am writing this review to mention the cheap quality of printing in the paperback copy I received. The letters are not sharp, rather, almost pixilated. I have never read a book before where the print was so fuzzy. Seems like it must have been printed on the cheap.

A project of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation




































LEONARD J. ELMORE


Television Basketball Analyst and Attorney
Leonard J. Elmore is an attorney and television basketball analyst.Elmore was an All-American basketball player at the University of Maryland, from 1971 to 1974, where he was awarded the University's Citizenship Award. He played professional basketball for 10 years and was a first round draft pick in both the ABA and the NBA. In 2002, Elmore was voted one of the Atlantic Coast Conference's “Top 50 Greatest Basketball Players.”
Elmore received a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1987, where he is believed to be the first and only National Basketball Association player to graduate from that institution upon retirement from his professional basketball career. He received his B.A. from University of Maryland in 1978.
A noted authority on sports and sports law issues including sports in society, Elmore has published numerous articles and commentaries for a diverse group of media outlets including National Public Radio, the Knight Ridder News Service, Sports Business Journal and ESPN.com.
He has appeared on a significant number of network and cable television news and sports programs and has served as a panelist or moderator at a variety of sports and law seminars. A coveted speaker, Mr. Elmore has delivered speeches and presentations for several professional organizations, colleges and universities, including a presentation for the 2005 University of Rhode Island Sports Colloquy entitled "Race and Sports” and the 2007 West Virginia College of Law Sports Symposium.
Elmore has served as a noted basketball analyst for more than 20 years, covering both NCAA men's basketball and the NBA. He has served as an analyst for ESPN for more than ten years, and also covers the NCAA Tournament for CBS.
Elmore served as iHoops CEO from May 2010 until February 2012. Elmore legal experience has included providing counsel on a broad range of issues to professional sports leagues, national governing bodies, professional and amateur athletes, sports acquisition groups and professional athlete management companies. Other practice experience includes providing counsel in the areas of corporate governance, labor and employment law, non-profit organizations and strategic decision-making and marketing issues.
From 2001 until 2003, Elmore served as president and CEO of Test University (TestU), an education technology company and leading provider of web-based, customized curriculum, student assessment and standardized test preparation solutions for middle and high school students, particularly those students in urban and disadvantaged areas. At TestU, Elmore led 40 employees and was responsible for the overall strategic, operational and fiscal direction of the company. Accomplishments include supervising the closing of a multi-million dollar strategic partnership with a major media company, increasing product sales and brand awareness among target customers and overseeing the development of several innovative products that greatly increased company competitiveness. The company was acquired in 2003.
In 1992, Elmore founded Precept Sports & Entertainment, a sports management company based in Columbia, Maryland. From 1992 to 1997, Precept represented seven NBA first round draft picks, including an overall number one pick, three high round draft picks in the National Football League, a Major League Baseball veteran and several Olympic athletes. The company negotiated tens of millions of dollars in performance and endorsement contracts over its five years of existence.
He began his legal career as a prosecutor and served as an assistant district attorney for Kings County, New York from 1987 to 1990, where he managed and tried numerous misdemeanor and felony cases, including police misconduct.
He is a member of the Bar of the State of New York and is admitted to practice before the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York and for the Baltimore District of Maryland.
Elmore is a member of the board of directors for 1-800-FLOWERS.com, the leading online and telephonic gift and flower retailer, where he chairs the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees. He is also a member of the board of directors of Lee Enterprises, Inc., a leading newspaper publishing company, where he serves on the Audit Committee. In 1998, he was appointed as a member of the board of trustees for the University of Maryland, College Park. From 1990 to 1998, Elmore served on the board of the University System of Maryland Foundation. He was a member of board of directors of the Sports Lawyers Association from 2000 to 2007. Elmore served on the board of directors of the National Basketball Retired Players Association, where he was elected president of the board in February 2005, and acted as interim chief executive from April 2007 to July 2008.
Elmore continues to fulfill his commitment to education, athletics and public service as a Knight Commission member and as a member of the board of trustees for The Boys Club of New York. He remains extensively involved in a wide range of other public service, educational and charitable activities.

Overview



Widely known as the crime fiction writer whose work led to the movies  Get Shorty and  Out of Sight, Elmore Leonard had a special knack for creating "cool" characters. In  Being Cool, Charles J. Rzepka looks at what makes the dope-dealers, bookies, grifters, financial advisors, talent agents, shady attorneys, hookers, models, and crooked cops of Leonard's world cool. They may be nefarious, but they are also confident, skilled, and composed. And they are good at what they do. Taking being cool as the highway through Leonard's life and works, Rzepka finds plenty of byways to explore along the way.Rzepka delineates the stages and patterns that characterize Leonard’s creative evolution. Like jazz greats, he forged an individual writing style immediately recognizable for its voice and rhythm, including his characters' rat-a-tat recitations, curt backhands, and ragged trains of thought. Rzepka draws on more than twelve hours of personal interviews with Leonard and applies what he learned to his close analysis of the writer’s long life and prodigious output: 45 published novels, 39 published and unpublished short stories, and numerous essays written over the course of six decades.

Editorial Reviews


Library Journal
11/01/2013When "the Dickens of Detroit," American novelist and screenwriter Elmore Leonard (1925–2013), died this summer, he was eulogized as a national treasure. The beloved author of more than 40 novels that form the backbone of American crime writing over half a century (Get Shorty; Rum Punch; Tishomingo Blues) deserves to be taken seriously by the academy, argues Rzepka (English, Boston Univ.; Inventions and Interventions). More pointed than earlier biography and analysis of the author's work from Paul Challen, James E. Devlin, and David Geherin, Rzepka's work sets about defining "cool" through Leonard's many quirky, engaging characters, revealing a great deal more about the writer. Drawn from a dozen hours of conversation with Leonard and years of attention to his writings, the book includes a photo insert as well as a comprehensive bibliography and a useful sampling of secondary sources. VERDICT Rzepka's close reading of Leonard's fiction is an insightful, thorough, and timely addition to scholarship on the author. Although the analysis here has a distinct academic bent, Rzepka's prose and arguments are accessible, with an eye toward attracting lay readers interested in a deeper understanding of Leonard's fiction.—Patrick A. Smith, Bainbridge Coll., GA

							Improve verbal and written communication skills using these language arts and discipline books. Available in a few media formats, these books feature advice and exercises designed to instill important language concepts such as grammar. They're appropriate for teaching others or personal development.All Reading LevelsNo matter which reading level a person possesses, there are language arts and discipline books designed to meet the individual's needs. Use word practice books to help those at elementary school reading levels comprehend and use words appropriately, or people at high school and above reading levels can turn to style guides to learn how to craft essays or business reports that clearly communicate their ideas.Variety of Media TypesThese language arts and discipline books come in several formats including audio, hardcover, paperback and compact disc. This makes it easier to integrate the lessons into your busy life. Listen to audio recordings of important language concepts during your daily commute, or use the books to study at home or keep in your bookcase for reference. The wide selection of options makes the books a great addition to classrooms and professional offices.Any Language Subject You NeedLanguage is a broad subject, and there are language arts and discipline books to cover almost every topic. Impress your friends or business associates with facts you learned from reading about the history of the English language, or study how to smoothly transition between ideas when writing reports, essays, or novels. Language books provide the first step to becoming an expert in a topic by bolstering your knowledge about a particular subject.

Elmore John Leonard Jr. (October 11, 1925 – August 20, 2013) was an American novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter. His earliest novels, published in the 1950s, were Westerns, but he went on to specialize in crime fiction and suspense thrillers, many of which have been adapted into motion pictures.
Among his best-known works are Get Shorty, Out of Sight, Swag, Hombre, Mr. Majestyk, and Rum Punch (adapted for the movie Jackie Brown). Leonard's writings include short stories that became the films 3:10 to Yuma and The Tall T, as well as the FX television series Justified.

Early life and education[edit]
Leonard was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Flora Amelia (née Rive) and Elmore John Leonard, Sr.[3] Because his father worked as a site locator for General Motors, the family moved frequently for several years. In 1934, the family settled in Detroit.
He graduated from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School in 1943 and, after being rejected for the Marines for weak eyesight, immediately joined the Navy, where he served with the Seabees for three years in the South Pacific (gaining the nickname "Dutch", after pitcher Dutch Leonard).[4] Enrolling at the University of Detroit in 1946, he pursued writing more seriously, entering his work in short story contests and sending it off to magazines. He graduated in 1950[5] with a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy. A year before he graduated, he got a job as a copy writer with Campbell-Ewald Advertising Agency, a position he kept for several years, writing on the side.[5]
Career[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2014)


Leonard got his first break in the fiction market during the 1950s, regularly publishing pulp Western novels. Leonard had his first success in 1951 when Argosy published the short story "Trail of the Apaches".[6]:29 During the 1950s and early 1960s, he continued writing Westerns, publishing more than 30 short stories. He wrote his first novel, The Bounty Hunters, in 1953 and followed this with four other novels. Five of his westerns were turned into major movies before 1972:[7] The Tall T[8] (Richard Boone), 3:10 to Yuma[9] (Glenn Ford), Hombre[10] (Paul Newman), Valdez Is Coming[11] (Burt Lancaster), and Joe Kidd[12] (Clint Eastwood).
He went on to write seventeen novels and stories in the mystery, crime, and more topical genres which were made into movies between 1969 and 2013.[citation needed]
In 1985, his breakout novel, Glitz was published. At the time of his death he had sold tens of millions of copies of his novels.[13]
Among his later movies are Jackie Brown (starring Pam Grier, directed by Quentin Tarantino) which is a "homage to the author’s trademark rhythm and pace";[13] Get Shorty (1995, John Travolta and Gene Hackman); and Out of Sight (1999, George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, directed by Steven Soderbergh).[14]
Personal life[edit]
He married Beverly Clare Cline in 1949, and they had five children together—three daughters and two sons[15]—before divorcing in 1977. His second marriage in 1979, to Joan Leanne Lancaster (aka Joan Shepard), ended with her death in 1993. Later that same year, he married Christine Kent, and they divorced in 2012.[16][17][18]
Leonard spent the last years of his life with his family in Oakland County, Michigan. He suffered a stroke on July 29, 2013. Initial reports stated that Leonard was recovering,[19] but on August 20, 2013, Leonard died at his home in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills of stroke complications.[20] He was 87 years old.[16] Leonard is survived by his five children, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.[17]
Writing style[edit]
Commended by critics for his gritty realism and strong dialogue, Leonard sometimes took liberties with grammar in the interest of speeding the story along.[21] In his essay "Elmore Leonard's Ten Rules of Writing" he said: "My most important rule is one that sums up the 10: If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it." He also hinted: "I try to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip."[21]
Elmore Leonard has been called "the Dickens of Detroit" because of his intimate portraits of people from that city, though he said, "If I lived in Buffalo, I'd write about Buffalo."[6]: 90 His favourite epithet was one given by Britain's New Musical Express: "the poet laureate of wild assholes with revolvers".[22] His ear for dialogue has been praised by writers such as Saul Bellow, Martin Amis, and Stephen King. "Your prose makes Raymond Chandler look clumsy," Amis told Leonard at a Writers Guild event in Beverly Hills in 1998.[23] Stephen King has called him "the great American writer."[24] According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, Leonard's mastery of free indirect discourse, a third-person narrative technique that gives the illusion of immediate access to a character's thoughts, "is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, and Hemingway in the mix." [25]
Leonard often cited Ernest Hemingway as perhaps his single most important influence, but at the same time criticized Hemingway for his lack of humor and for taking himself too seriously.[26] Still, it was Leonard's affection for Hemingway, as well as George V. Higgins, that led him to will his personal papers to the University of South Carolina, where many of Hemingway's and Higgins' papers are archived. Leonard's papers reside at the university's Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections.[27][28][29]

The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard



Leonard also wrote a short story included in the anthology Murderers' Row: Original Baseball Mysteries edited by Otto Penzler (2001).[34] (Leonard's is the back story for his novel Tishomingo Blues (2002).[citation needed])
Nonfiction[edit]

10 Rules of Writing (2007)
Foreword to Walter Mirisch's book I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History

Adaptations[edit]
Twenty-six of Leonard's novels and short stories have been adapted for the screen (19 as motion pictures and another seven as television programs).
Film[edit]
Aside from the short stories already noted, a number of Leonard's novels have been adapted as films, including Get Shorty (1990 novel, 1995 film), Out of Sight (1996 novel, 1998 film), and Rum Punch (1992 novel, 1997 film Jackie Brown). 52 Pick-Up (1986 film) was first adapted very loosely into the 1984 film The Ambassador (1984), starring Robert Mitchum and, two years later, under its original title starring Roy Scheider. Leonard has also written several screenplays based on his novels, plus original screenplays such as Joe Kidd (1972).
The film Hombre (1967), starring Paul Newman, was an adaptation of Leonard's 1961 novel of the same name.
His short story "Three-Ten to Yuma" (March 1953) and novels The Big Bounce (1969) and 52 Pick-Up have each been filmed twice.
Other novels filmed include:

Mr. Majestyk (with Charles Bronson)
Valdez Is Coming (with Burt Lancaster)
52 Pick-Up (with Roy Scheider)
Stick (with Burt Reynolds)
The Moonshine War (with Alan Alda)
Last Stand at Saber River (with Tom Selleck)
Gold Coast (with David Caruso)
Glitz (with Jimmy Smits)
Cat Chaser (with Peter Weller)
Out of Sight (George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez)
Touch (with Christopher Walken)
Pronto (with Peter Falk)
Be Cool (with John Travolta)
Killshot (Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke).
Get Shorty (with John Travolta)
Life of Crime (with Jennifer Aniston) (based on The Switch)

Quentin Tarantino has optioned the right to adapt Leonard's novel Forty Lashes Less One (1972).[35][36]
Television[edit]

In 1992, Leonard played himself in a script he wrote and, with actor Paul Lazar dramatizing a scene from the novel Swag, appeared in a humorous television short about his writing process which aired on the Byline Showtime series on Showtime Networks.[18]
The 2010-15 FX series Justified was based around the popular Leonard character U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, from the novels Pronto, Riding the Rap, the eponymous Raylan, and the short story "Fire in the Hole".
The short-lived 1998 TV series Maximum Bob was based on Leonard's 1991 novel of the same name. It aired on ABC for seven episodes and starred Beau Bridges.
The TV series Karen Sisco (2003–04) starring Carla Gugino was based on the U.S. Marshall character from the film Out of Sight (1998) played by Jennifer Lopez.
The 2017 Epix series Get Shorty is based on the novel of the same.[37]

Elmore John Leonard Jr. (October 11, 1925 – August 20, 2013) was an American novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter. His earliest novels, published in the 1950s, were Westerns, but he went on to specialize in crime fiction and suspense thrillers, many of which have been adapted into motion pictures.
Among his best-known works are Get Shorty, Out of Sight, Swag, Hombre, Mr. Majestyk, and Rum Punch (adapted for the movie Jackie Brown). Leonard's writings include short stories that became the films 3:10 to Yuma and The Tall T, as well as the FX television series Justified.

Early life and education[edit]
Leonard was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Flora Amelia (née Rive) and Elmore John Leonard, Sr.[3] Because his father worked as a site locator for General Motors, the family moved frequently for several years. In 1934, the family settled in Detroit.
He graduated from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School in 1943 and, after being rejected for the Marines for weak eyesight, immediately joined the Navy, where he served with the Seabees for three years in the South Pacific (gaining the nickname "Dutch", after pitcher Dutch Leonard).[4] Enrolling at the University of Detroit in 1946, he pursued writing more seriously, entering his work in short story contests and sending it off to magazines. He graduated in 1950[5] with a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy. A year before he graduated, he got a job as a copy writer with Campbell-Ewald Advertising Agency, a position he kept for several years, writing on the side.[5]
Career[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2014)


Leonard got his first break in the fiction market during the 1950s, regularly publishing pulp Western novels. Leonard had his first success in 1951 when Argosy published the short story "Trail of the Apaches".[6]:29 During the 1950s and early 1960s, he continued writing Westerns, publishing more than 30 short stories. He wrote his first novel, The Bounty Hunters, in 1953 and followed this with four other novels. Five of his westerns were turned into major movies before 1972:[7] The Tall T[8] (Richard Boone), 3:10 to Yuma[9] (Glenn Ford), Hombre[10] (Paul Newman), Valdez Is Coming[11] (Burt Lancaster), and Joe Kidd[12] (Clint Eastwood).
He went on to write seventeen novels and stories in the mystery, crime, and more topical genres which were made into movies between 1969 and 2013.[citation needed]
In 1985, his breakout novel, Glitz was published. At the time of his death he had sold tens of millions of copies of his novels.[13]
Among his later movies are Jackie Brown (starring Pam Grier, directed by Quentin Tarantino) which is a "homage to the author’s trademark rhythm and pace";[13] Get Shorty (1995, John Travolta and Gene Hackman); and Out of Sight (1999, George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, directed by Steven Soderbergh).[14]
Personal life[edit]
He married Beverly Clare Cline in 1949, and they had five children together—three daughters and two sons[15]—before divorcing in 1977. His second marriage in 1979, to Joan Leanne Lancaster (aka Joan Shepard), ended with her death in 1993. Later that same year, he married Christine Kent, and they divorced in 2012.[16][17][18]
Leonard spent the last years of his life with his family in Oakland County, Michigan. He suffered a stroke on July 29, 2013. Initial reports stated that Leonard was recovering,[19] but on August 20, 2013, Leonard died at his home in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills of stroke complications.[20] He was 87 years old.[16] Leonard is survived by his five children, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.[17]
Writing style[edit]
Commended by critics for his gritty realism and strong dialogue, Leonard sometimes took liberties with grammar in the interest of speeding the story along.[21] In his essay "Elmore Leonard's Ten Rules of Writing" he said: "My most important rule is one that sums up the 10: If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it." He also hinted: "I try to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip."[21]
Elmore Leonard has been called "the Dickens of Detroit" because of his intimate portraits of people from that city, though he said, "If I lived in Buffalo, I'd write about Buffalo."[6]: 90 His favourite epithet was one given by Britain's New Musical Express: "the poet laureate of wild assholes with revolvers".[22] His ear for dialogue has been praised by writers such as Saul Bellow, Martin Amis, and Stephen King. "Your prose makes Raymond Chandler look clumsy," Amis told Leonard at a Writers Guild event in Beverly Hills in 1998.[23] Stephen King has called him "the great American writer."[24] According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, Leonard's mastery of free indirect discourse, a third-person narrative technique that gives the illusion of immediate access to a character's thoughts, "is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, and Hemingway in the mix." [25]
Leonard often cited Ernest Hemingway as perhaps his single most important influence, but at the same time criticized Hemingway for his lack of humor and for taking himself too seriously.[26] Still, it was Leonard's affection for Hemingway, as well as George V. Higgins, that led him to will his personal papers to the University of South Carolina, where many of Hemingway's and Higgins' papers are archived. Leonard's papers reside at the university's Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections.[27][28][29]
Awards and honors[edit]

The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard



Leonard also wrote a short story included in the anthology Murderers' Row: Original Baseball Mysteries edited by Otto Penzler (2001).[34] (Leonard's is the back story for his novel Tishomingo Blues (2002).[citation needed])
Nonfiction[edit]

10 Rules of Writing (2007)
Foreword to Walter Mirisch's book I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History

Adaptations[edit]
Twenty-six of Leonard's novels and short stories have been adapted for the screen (19 as motion pictures and another seven as television programs).
Film[edit]
Aside from the short stories already noted, a number of Leonard's novels have been adapted as films, including Get Shorty (1990 novel, 1995 film), Out of Sight (1996 novel, 1998 film), and Rum Punch (1992 novel, 1997 film Jackie Brown). 52 Pick-Up (1986 film) was first adapted very loosely into the 1984 film The Ambassador (1984), starring Robert Mitchum and, two years later, under its original title starring Roy Scheider. Leonard has also written several screenplays based on his novels, plus original screenplays such as Joe Kidd (1972).
The film Hombre (1967), starring Paul Newman, was an adaptation of Leonard's 1961 novel of the same name.
His short story "Three-Ten to Yuma" (March 1953) and novels The Big Bounce (1969) and 52 Pick-Up have each been filmed twice.
Other novels filmed include:

Mr. Majestyk (with Charles Bronson)
Valdez Is Coming (with Burt Lancaster)
52 Pick-Up (with Roy Scheider)
Stick (with Burt Reynolds)
The Moonshine War (with Alan Alda)
Last Stand at Saber River (with Tom Selleck)
Gold Coast (with David Caruso)
Glitz (with Jimmy Smits)
Cat Chaser (with Peter Weller)
Out of Sight (George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez)
Touch (with Christopher Walken)
Pronto (with Peter Falk)
Be Cool (with John Travolta)
Killshot (Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke).
Get Shorty (with John Travolta)
Life of Crime (with Jennifer Aniston) (based on The Switch)

Quentin Tarantino has optioned the right to adapt Leonard's novel Forty Lashes Less One (1972).[35][36]
Television[edit]

In 1992, Leonard played himself in a script he wrote and, with actor Paul Lazar dramatizing a scene from the novel Swag, appeared in a humorous television short about his writing process which aired on the Byline Showtime series on Showtime Networks.[18]
The 2010-15 FX series Justified was based around the popular Leonard character U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, from the novels Pronto, Riding the Rap, the eponymous Raylan, and the short story "Fire in the Hole".
The short-lived 1998 TV series Maximum Bob was based on Leonard's 1991 novel of the same name. It aired on ABC for seven episodes and starred Beau Bridges.
The TV series Karen Sisco (2003–04) starring Carla Gugino was based on the U.S. Marshall character from the film Out of Sight (1998) played by Jennifer Lopez.
The 2017 Epix series Get Shorty is based on the novel of the same.[37]

Elmore John Leonard Jr. (October 11, 1925 – August 20, 2013) was an American novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter. His earliest novels, published in the 1950s, were Westerns, but he went on to specialize in crime fiction and suspense thrillers, many of which have been adapted into motion pictures.
Among his best-known works are Get Shorty, Out of Sight, Swag, Hombre, Mr. Majestyk, and Rum Punch (adapted for the movie Jackie Brown). Leonard's writings include short stories that became the films 3:10 to Yuma and The Tall T, as well as the FX television series Justified.

Early life and education[edit]
Leonard was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Flora Amelia (née Rive) and Elmore John Leonard, Sr.[3] Because his father worked as a site locator for General Motors, the family moved frequently for several years. In 1934, the family settled in Detroit.
He graduated from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School in 1943 and, after being rejected for the Marines for weak eyesight, immediately joined the Navy, where he served with the Seabees for three years in the South Pacific (gaining the nickname "Dutch", after pitcher Dutch Leonard).[4] Enrolling at the University of Detroit in 1946, he pursued writing more seriously, entering his work in short story contests and sending it off to magazines. He graduated in 1950[5] with a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy. A year before he graduated, he got a job as a copy writer with Campbell-Ewald Advertising Agency, a position he kept for several years, writing on the side.[5]
Career[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2014)


Leonard got his first break in the fiction market during the 1950s, regularly publishing pulp Western novels. Leonard had his first success in 1951 when Argosy published the short story "Trail of the Apaches".[6]:29 During the 1950s and early 1960s, he continued writing Westerns, publishing more than 30 short stories. He wrote his first novel, The Bounty Hunters, in 1953 and followed this with four other novels. Five of his westerns were turned into major movies before 1972:[7] The Tall T[8] (Richard Boone), 3:10 to Yuma[9] (Glenn Ford), Hombre[10] (Paul Newman), Valdez Is Coming[11] (Burt Lancaster), and Joe Kidd[12] (Clint Eastwood).
He went on to write seventeen novels and stories in the mystery, crime, and more topical genres which were made into movies between 1969 and 2013.[citation needed]
In 1985, his breakout novel, Glitz was published. At the time of his death he had sold tens of millions of copies of his novels.[13]
Among his later movies are Jackie Brown (starring Pam Grier, directed by Quentin Tarantino) which is a "homage to the author’s trademark rhythm and pace";[13] Get Shorty (1995, John Travolta and Gene Hackman); and Out of Sight (1999, George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, directed by Steven Soderbergh).[14]
Personal life[edit]
He married Beverly Clare Cline in 1949, and they had five children together—three daughters and two sons[15]—before divorcing in 1977. His second marriage in 1979, to Joan Leanne Lancaster (aka Joan Shepard), ended with her death in 1993. Later that same year, he married Christine Kent, and they divorced in 2012.[16][17][18]
Leonard spent the last years of his life with his family in Oakland County, Michigan. He suffered a stroke on July 29, 2013. Initial reports stated that Leonard was recovering,[19] but on August 20, 2013, Leonard died at his home in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills of stroke complications.[20] He was 87 years old.[16] Leonard is survived by his five children, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.[17]
Writing style[edit]
Commended by critics for his gritty realism and strong dialogue, Leonard sometimes took liberties with grammar in the interest of speeding the story along.[21] In his essay "Elmore Leonard's Ten Rules of Writing" he said: "My most important rule is one that sums up the 10: If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it." He also hinted: "I try to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip."[21]
Elmore Leonard has been called "the Dickens of Detroit" because of his intimate portraits of people from that city, though he said, "If I lived in Buffalo, I'd write about Buffalo."[6]: 90 His favourite epithet was one given by Britain's New Musical Express: "the poet laureate of wild assholes with revolvers".[22] His ear for dialogue has been praised by writers such as Saul Bellow, Martin Amis, and Stephen King. "Your prose makes Raymond Chandler look clumsy," Amis told Leonard at a Writers Guild event in Beverly Hills in 1998.[23] Stephen King has called him "the great American writer."[24] According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, Leonard's mastery of free indirect discourse, a third-person narrative technique that gives the illusion of immediate access to a character's thoughts, "is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, and Hemingway in the mix." [25]
Leonard often cited Ernest Hemingway as perhaps his single most important influence, but at the same time criticized Hemingway for his lack of humor and for taking himself too seriously.[26] Still, it was Leonard's affection for Hemingway, as well as George V. Higgins, that led him to will his personal papers to the University of South Carolina, where many of Hemingway's and Higgins' papers are archived. Leonard's papers reside at the university's Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections.[27][28][29]

The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard



Leonard also wrote a short story included in the anthology Murderers' Row: Original Baseball Mysteries edited by Otto Penzler (2001).[34] (Leonard's is the back story for his novel Tishomingo Blues (2002).[citation needed])
Nonfiction[edit]

Foreword to Walter Mirisch's book I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History

Adaptations[edit]
Twenty-six of Leonard's novels and short stories have been adapted for the screen (19 as motion pictures and another seven as television programs).
Film[edit]
Aside from the short stories already noted, a number of Leonard's novels have been adapted as films, including Get Shorty (1990 novel, 1995 film), Out of Sight (1996 novel, 1998 film), and Rum Punch (1992 novel, 1997 film Jackie Brown). 52 Pick-Up (1986 film) was first adapted very loosely into the 1984 film The Ambassador (1984), starring Robert Mitchum and, two years later, under its original title starring Roy Scheider. Leonard has also written several screenplays based on his novels, plus original screenplays such as Joe Kidd (1972).
The film Hombre (1967), starring Paul Newman, was an adaptation of Leonard's 1961 novel of the same name.
His short story "Three-Ten to Yuma" (March 1953) and novels The Big Bounce (1969) and 52 Pick-Up have each been filmed twice.
Other novels filmed include:

Mr. Majestyk (with Charles Bronson)
Valdez Is Coming (with Burt Lancaster)
52 Pick-Up (with Roy Scheider)

Quentin Tarantino has optioned the right to adapt Leonard's novel Forty Lashes Less One (1972).[35][36]
Television[edit]

In 1992, Leonard played himself in a script he wrote and, with actor Paul Lazar dramatizing a scene from the novel Swag, appeared in a humorous television short about his writing process which aired on the Byline Showtime series on Showtime Networks.[18]
The 2010-15 FX series Justified was based around the popular Leonard character U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, from the novels Pronto, Riding the Rap, the eponymous Raylan, and the short story "Fire in the Hole".
The short-lived 1998 TV series Maximum Bob was based on Leonard's 1991 novel of the same name. It aired on ABC for seven episodes and starred Beau Bridges.
The TV series Karen Sisco (2003–04) starring Carla Gugino was based on the U.S. Marshall character from the film Out of Sight (1998) played by Jennifer Lopez.
The 2017 Epix series Get Shorty is based on the novel of the same.[37]

Elmore John Leonard Jr. (October 11, 1925 – August 20, 2013) was an American novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter. His earliest novels, published in the 1950s, were Westerns, but he went on to specialize in crime fiction and suspense thrillers, many of which have been adapted into motion pictures.
Among his best-known works are Get Shorty, Out of Sight, Swag, Hombre, Mr. Majestyk, and Rum Punch (adapted for the movie Jackie Brown). Leonard's writings include short stories that became the films 3:10 to Yuma and The Tall T, as well as the FX television series Justified.

Early life and education[edit]
Leonard was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Flora Amelia (née Rive) and Elmore John Leonard, Sr.[3] Because his father worked as a site locator for General Motors, the family moved frequently for several years. In 1934, the family settled in Detroit.
He graduated from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School in 1943 and, after being rejected for the Marines for weak eyesight, immediately joined the Navy, where he served with the Seabees for three years in the South Pacific (gaining the nickname "Dutch", after pitcher Dutch Leonard).[4] Enrolling at the University of Detroit in 1946, he pursued writing more seriously, entering his work in short story contests and sending it off to magazines. He graduated in 1950[5] with a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy. A year before he graduated, he got a job as a copy writer with Campbell-Ewald Advertising Agency, a position he kept for several years, writing on the side.[5]
Career[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2014)


Leonard got his first break in the fiction market during the 1950s, regularly publishing pulp Western novels. Leonard had his first success in 1951 when Argosy published the short story "Trail of the Apaches".[6]:29 During the 1950s and early 1960s, he continued writing Westerns, publishing more than 30 short stories. He wrote his first novel, The Bounty Hunters, in 1953 and followed this with four other novels. Five of his westerns were turned into major movies before 1972:[7] The Tall T[8] (Richard Boone), 3:10 to Yuma[9] (Glenn Ford), Hombre[10] (Paul Newman), Valdez Is Coming[11] (Burt Lancaster), and Joe Kidd[12] (Clint Eastwood).
He went on to write seventeen novels and stories in the mystery, crime, and more topical genres which were made into movies between 1969 and 2013.[citation needed]
In 1985, his breakout novel, Glitz was published. At the time of his death he had sold tens of millions of copies of his novels.[13]
Among his later movies are Jackie Brown (starring Pam Grier, directed by Quentin Tarantino) which is a "homage to the author’s trademark rhythm and pace";[13] Get Shorty (1995, John Travolta and Gene Hackman); and Out of Sight (1999, George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, directed by Steven Soderbergh).[14]
Personal life[edit]
He married Beverly Clare Cline in 1949, and they had five children together—three daughters and two sons[15]—before divorcing in 1977. His second marriage in 1979, to Joan Leanne Lancaster (aka Joan Shepard), ended with her death in 1993. Later that same year, he married Christine Kent, and they divorced in 2012.[16][17][18]
Leonard spent the last years of his life with his family in Oakland County, Michigan. He suffered a stroke on July 29, 2013. Initial reports stated that Leonard was recovering,[19] but on August 20, 2013, Leonard died at his home in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills of stroke complications.[20] He was 87 years old.[16] Leonard is survived by his five children, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.[17]
Writing style[edit]
Commended by critics for his gritty realism and strong dialogue, Leonard sometimes took liberties with grammar in the interest of speeding the story along.[21] In his essay "Elmore Leonard's Ten Rules of Writing" he said: "My most important rule is one that sums up the 10: If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it." He also hinted: "I try to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip."[21]
Elmore Leonard has been called "the Dickens of Detroit" because of his intimate portraits of people from that city, though he said, "If I lived in Buffalo, I'd write about Buffalo."[6]: 90 His favourite epithet was one given by Britain's New Musical Express: "the poet laureate of wild assholes with revolvers".[22] His ear for dialogue has been praised by writers such as Saul Bellow, Martin Amis, and Stephen King. "Your prose makes Raymond Chandler look clumsy," Amis told Leonard at a Writers Guild event in Beverly Hills in 1998.[23] Stephen King has called him "the great American writer."[24] According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, Leonard's mastery of free indirect discourse, a third-person narrative technique that gives the illusion of immediate access to a character's thoughts, "is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, and Hemingway in the mix." [25]
Leonard often cited Ernest Hemingway as perhaps his single most important influence, but at the same time criticized Hemingway for his lack of humor and for taking himself too seriously.[26] Still, it was Leonard's affection for Hemingway, as well as George V. Higgins, that led him to will his personal papers to the University of South Carolina, where many of Hemingway's and Higgins' papers are archived. Leonard's papers reside at the university's Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections.[27][28][29]
Awards and honors[edit]

The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard



Leonard also wrote a short story included in the anthology Murderers' Row: Original Baseball Mysteries edited by Otto Penzler (2001).[34] (Leonard's is the back story for his novel Tishomingo Blues (2002).[citation needed])

Adaptations[edit]
Twenty-six of Leonard's novels and short stories have been adapted for the screen (19 as motion pictures and another seven as television programs).
Film[edit]
Aside from the short stories already noted, a number of Leonard's novels have been adapted as films, including Get Shorty (1990 novel, 1995 film), Out of Sight (1996 novel, 1998 film), and Rum Punch (1992 novel, 1997 film Jackie Brown). 52 Pick-Up (1986 film) was first adapted very loosely into the 1984 film The Ambassador (1984), starring Robert Mitchum and, two years later, under its original title starring Roy Scheider. Leonard has also written several screenplays based on his novels, plus original screenplays such as Joe Kidd (1972).
The film Hombre (1967), starring Paul Newman, was an adaptation of Leonard's 1961 novel of the same name.
His short story "Three-Ten to Yuma" (March 1953) and novels The Big Bounce (1969) and 52 Pick-Up have each been filmed twice.
Other novels filmed include:

Mr. Majestyk (with Charles Bronson)
Valdez Is Coming (with Burt Lancaster)

Quentin Tarantino has optioned the right to adapt Leonard's novel Forty Lashes Less One (1972).[35][36]
Television[edit]

In 1992, Leonard played himself in a script he wrote and, with actor Paul Lazar dramatizing a scene from the novel Swag, appeared in a humorous television short about his writing process which aired on the Byline Showtime series on Showtime Networks.[18]
The 2010-15 FX series Justified was based around the popular Leonard character U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, from the novels Pronto, Riding the Rap, the eponymous Raylan, and the short story "Fire in the Hole".
The short-lived 1998 TV series Maximum Bob was based on Leonard's 1991 novel of the same name. It aired on ABC for seven episodes and starred Beau Bridges.
The TV series Karen Sisco (2003–04) starring Carla Gugino was based on the U.S. Marshall character from the film Out of Sight (1998) played by Jennifer Lopez.
The 2017 Epix series Get Shorty is based on the novel of the same.[37]

BOOKSCrime writer Elmore Leonard dies, aged 87NaN:aNOctober 1st 20152 years ago

Crime novelist Elmore Leonard known for his works 'Get Shorty' and 'Out of Sight' has died, aged 87.12AP7:41AM August 21, 2013SaveShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on emailShare more...Share on Google+Share on RedditShare on WhatsappPrint this articleXHE was the master of his genre, the Dickens of Detroit, the Chaucer of Crime.Pretty much every novel Elmore Leonard wrote from the mid-1980s on was a best-seller, and every fan of crime stories knew his name. George Clooney was an admirer. So were Quentin Tarantino, Saul Bellow and Stephen King and millions of ordinary readers.Leonard, who died Tuesday at age 87, helped achieve for crime writing what King did for horror and Ray Bradbury for science fiction. He made it hip, and he made it respectable.When the public flocked to watch John Travolta in the movie version of "Get Shorty" in 1995, its author became the darling of Hollywood's hottest young directors. Book critics and literary stars, prone to dismissing crime novels as light entertainment, competed for adjectives to praise him. Last fall, he became the first crime writer to receive an honorary National Book Award, a prize given in the past to Philip Roth, Norman Mailer and Arthur Miller.Few writers so memorably travelled the low road. His more than 40 novels were peopled by pathetic schemers, clever conmen and casual killers. Each was characterised by moral ambivalence about crime, black humour and wickedly acute depictions of human nature: the greedy dreams of Armand Degas in "Killshot," the wisecracking cool of Chili Palmer in "Get Shorty," Jack Belmont's lust for notoriety in "The Hot Kid."Leonard's novels and short stories were turned into dozens of feature films, TV movies and series, including the current FX show "Justified," which stars Timothy Olyphant as one of Leonard's signature characters, the cool-under-pressure US marshal Raylan Givens.Critics loved Leonard's flawlessly unadorned, colloquial style, as well as how real his characters sounded when they spoke."People always say, 'Where do you get (your characters') words?' And I say, 'Can't you remember people talking or think up people talking in your head?' That's all it is. I don't know why that seems such a wonder to people," he told The Associated Press last year.Leonard spent much of his childhood in Detroit and set many of his novels in the city. Others were set in Miami near his North Palm Beach, Florida, vacation home.He died at his home in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Township, where he did much of his writing, from complications of a stroke he suffered a few weeks ago, according to his researcher, Gregg Sutter.Crime novelist James Lee Burke said Leonard was a "gentleman of the old school" whose stylistic techniques and "experimentation with point of view and narrative voice had an enormous influence on hundreds of publishing writers."Leonard's work contained moral and political themes without being didactic, Burke said. "And he was able to write social satire disguised as a crime novel, or he could write a crime novel disguised as social satire."Leonard didn't have a best-seller until he was 60, and few critics took him seriously before the 1990s. Now the Library of America, which publishes hardcover editions of classic American writing, is planning a three-volume set of his work.He had some minor successes in the 1950s and '60s writing Western stories and novels, a couple of which were made into movies. But when interest in the Western dried up, he turned to writing scripts for educational and industrial films while trying his hand at another genre: crime novels.The first, "The Big Bounce," was rejected many times before it was published as a paperback in 1969. Hollywood came calling again, paying $50,000 for the rights and turning it into a movie starring Ryan O'Neal that even Leonard called "terrible."He followed up with several more fast-paced crime novels, including "Swag" (1976). Leonard was already following the advice he would later give to young writers: "Try to leave out the parts that people skip."In 1978, he was commissioned to write an article about the Detroit Police Department and shadowed police officers for nearly three months. Starting with "City Primeval" in 1980, his crime novels gained a new authenticity, with quirky but believable characters and crisp, slangy dialogue. But sales remained light.Donald I. Fine, an editor at Arbor House, thought they deserved better and promised to put the muscle of his publicity department behind them. He delivered: In 1985, "Glitz," a stylish novel of vengeance set in Atlantic City, became Leonard's first best-seller.Hollywood rediscovered him, churning out a succession of bad movies, including "52 Pick-up" starring Roy Scheider.It took Barry Sonnenfeld to finally show Hollywood how to turn a Leonard novel into a really good movie. "Get Shorty" was the first to feel and sound like a true Leonard story.Then Quentin Tarantino took a turn with "Rum Punch," turning it into "Jackie Brown," a campy film starring Pam Grier. But Steven Soderbergh stayed faithful to Leonard's story and dialogue with "Out of Sight."There are more adaptations of Leonard novels on the way. In September, "Life of Crime," based on Leonard's "The Switch," will premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. It stars John Hawkes and Jennifer Aniston.Sutter said Leonard had seen "a little bit of the film and liked what he saw."Writing well into his 80s, Leonard's process remained the same.He settled in at his home office around 10am behind a desk covered with stacks of paper and books. He lit a cigarette and began writing longhand on the 63-page unlined yellow pads that were custom-made for him.When he finished a page, Leonard transferred the words onto a separate piece of paper using an electric typewriter. He tried to complete between three and five pages by the time his workday ended at 6pm."Well, you've got to put in the time if you want to write a book," Leonard told AP in 2010.Leonard sold his first story, "Trail of the Apache," in 1951, and followed with 30 more for such magazines as "Dime Western," earning 2 or 3 cents a word. At the time, he was working in advertising, but he would wake up early to work on his fiction before trudging off to write Chevrolet ads.One story, "3:10 to Yuma," became a noted 1956 movie starring Glenn Ford. That same year, "The Captives" was made into a film called "The Tall T." But the small windfall wasn't enough for Leonard to quit his day job. ("3:10 to Yuma" was remade in 2007, starring Russell Crowe.)His first novel, "The Bounty Hunters," was published in 1953, and he wrote four more in the next eight years. One of them, "Hombre," about a white man raised by Apaches, was a breakthrough for the struggling young writer. When 20th Century Fox bought the rights for $10,000 in 1967, he quit the ad business to write full time."Hombre" became a pretty good movie starring Paul Newman, and the book was named one of the greatest Westerns of all time by the Western Writers of America.Soon, another Leonard Western, "Valdez Is Coming," became a star vehicle for Burt Lancaster. But as the 1960s ended, the market for Westerns fizzled. Leonard wrote five more, but they sold poorly, and Hollywood lost interest.Leonard was born in New Orleans on October 11, 1925, the son of General Motors executive Elmore John Leonard and his wife, Flora.The family settled near Detroit when young Elmore was a boy. The tough, undersized young man played quarterback in high school and earned the nickname "Dutch," after Emil "Dutch" Leonard, a knuckleball pitcher of the day. The ballplayer's card sat for years in the writer's study on one of the shelves lined with copies of his books.After serving in the Navy during World War II, he majored in English at the University of Detroit. He started writing copy for an advertising agency before his graduation in 1950.He married three times and had five children.His son, Peter, followed in his father's path, going into advertising for years before achieving his own success as a novelist with his 2008 debut, "Quiver."A visitation was scheduled for Friday in the Detroit suburb of Clawson, to be followed by a funeral Mass Saturday in nearby Birmingham.In 2012, after learning he was to become a National Book Award lifetime achievement recipient, Leonard said he had no intention of ending his life's work."I probably won't quit until I just quit everything - quit my life - because it's all I know how to do," he told the AP at the time. "And it's fun. I do have fun writing, and a long time ago, I told myself, 'You got to have fun at this, or it'll drive you nuts."'Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on emailShare more...Share on Google+Share on RedditShare on WhatsappPrint this articleX

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Elmore Leonard Quotes

American
-
Novelist

Born: October 11, 1925

When you are developing your style, you avoid weaknesses. I am not good at describing things, so I stay away from it. And if anyone is going to describe anything at all, it's going to be from the point of view of the character, because then I can use his voice, and his attitude will be revealed in the way he describes what he sees.
Elmore Leonard


Attitude,
Good,
Character



















The bad guys are the fun guys. The only people I have trouble with are the so-called normal types. Their language isn't very colorful, and they don't talk with any certain sound.
Elmore Leonard


Fun,
Language,
People
























I really - I don't take my work that seriously, and I think that's what keeps me loose. If I try to write, if I catch myself trying to write, I'll fall right on my face. I'll see it. If I see in the prose that I'm - 'Boy, look at me writing,' I rewrite it. I rewrite it because I don't, because I think it's distracting.
Elmore Leonard


Work,
Myself,
Writing



















I'm not aware of a cadence when writing, but I hear it after. I write in longhand, and that helps. You're closer to it, and you have to cross things out. You put a line through it, but it's still there. You might need it. When you erase a line on a computer, it's gone forever.
Elmore Leonard


Writing,
You,
Still



















When people ask me about my dialogue, I say, 'Don't you hear people talking?' That's all I do. I hear a certain type of individual, I decide this is what he should be, whatever it is, and then I hear him. Well, I don't hear anybody that I can't make talk.
Elmore Leonard


People,
Me,
You



















To me, a book is a book, an electronic device is not, and love of books was the reason I started writing.
Elmore Leonard


Love,
Writing,
Book



















I decided to write Westerns because there was a terrific market for Westerns in the '50s. There were a lot of pulp magazines, like 'Dime Western' and '10 Story Western' that were still being published. The better ones paid two cents a word. And I thought, 'I like Westerns.'
Elmore Leonard


Thought,
Better,
Story



















There are cities that get by on their good looks, offer climate and scenery, views of mountains or oceans, rockbound or with palm trees. And there are cities like Detroit that have to work for a living.
Elmore Leonard


Work,
Good,
Mountains



















If work was a good thing, the rich would have it all and not let you do it.
Elmore Leonard


Work,
Good,
Rich
























I think any writer is a fool if he doesn't do it for money. There needs to be some kind of incentive in addition to the project. It all goes together. It's fun to sit there and think of characters and get them into action, then be paid for it. I can't believe it when writers tell me 'I don't want to show my work to anybody'.
Elmore Leonard


Work,
Money,
Together



















I got halfway through 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.' I don't get it at all. What's the big thrill? It's boring.
Elmore Leonard


Girl,
Boring,
Halfway



















Never open a book with weather. There are exceptions. If you happen to be Barry Lopez, who has more ways to describe ice and snow than an Eskimo, you can do all the weather reporting you want.
Elmore Leonard


Weather,
Book,
Snow



















A friend of mine who is in the publishing business knew I was writing a book, and he said, 'Have you said anything yet about the good guy? Because I know you spend so much time with the bad guys.' Because they're fun. So then you have to make the good guy fun, in order to compete. That's the challenge.
Elmore Leonard


Business,
Time,
Good



















Everyone has his own sound. I'm not going to presume how to tell anybody how to write.
Elmore Leonard


Sound,
Write,
Everyone



















I would say just start writing. You've got to write every day. Copy someone that you like if you think that perhaps could become your sound, too. I did that with Hemingway, and I thought I was writing just like Hemingway. Then all of a sudden it occurred to me - he didn't have a sense of humor. I don't know anything he's written that's funny.
Elmore Leonard


Funny,
Humor,
Day
























If you take a few days to write an outline, you're just making up scenes that you think will work, that you think will be interesting. But as you write it, other ideas occur - better ideas that have to do with what you're writing.
Elmore Leonard


Work,
Writing,
Ideas



















I never see my bad guys as simply bad. They want pretty much the same thing that you and I want: they want to be happy.
Elmore Leonard


Happy,
Be Happy,
Want



















Writing screenplays is not my business. I've written half a dozen, and maybe half of those were made. But it was never a satisfying experience. It was just work. You're an employee. You would be told what to do. Studio execs would cross out my dialogue and put in their dialogue.
Elmore Leonard


Work,
Business,
Experience



















I think any writer is a fool if he doesn't do it for money. There needs to be some kind of incentive in addition to the project. It all goes together. It's fun to sit there and think of characters and get them into action, then be paid for it.
Elmore Leonard


Money,
Together,
Fool



















I don't believe in writer's block or waiting for inspiration. If you're a writer, you sit down and write.
Elmore Leonard


Waiting,
Believe,
You



















If I just sit here, what am I going to do? I don't have a trade. I don't teach or anything. I just love to make up characters and gradually build a story around them.
Elmore Leonard


Love,
Teach,
Story



















I try to leave out the parts readers skip.
Elmore Leonard


Try,
Leave,
Parts
























There are some people who have been reading me for years, and they keep saying kind things about the writing. That's what you're writing for, to get people to respond to it.
Elmore Leonard


Reading,
Writing,
People



















Sometimes female characters start out as the wife or girlfriend, but then I realize, 'No, she's the book,' and she becomes a main character. I surrender the book to her.
Elmore Leonard


Character,
Wife,
Book



















Writers - all writers, even screenwriters - like to make their mark. I don't think many screenwriters can write. They pass as writers.
Elmore Leonard


Think,
Write,
Mark



















The truth is that the writers who most influenced me weren't people categorized as crime writers. I'd say I learned more from John O'Hara, who isn't much read today but whose short stories I really admired, and Hemingway, who I think has lasted pretty good.
Elmore Leonard


Truth,
Today,
Good
