DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act)Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy, Notice and Takedown Procedure




It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov).
This DMCA Policy, Notice and Takedown Procedure page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to Good Gaming, Inc. as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. It is expected that all users of any part of the Company Web Site will comply with applicable copyright laws. If, however, we receive proper notification (as outlined below) of claimed copyright infringement, our response to such notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating contributors, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.
If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the creator of the affected content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.
INFRINGEMENT NOTIFICATION:

Deck Guide: Jade Elemental Token Shaman
Author: Spark
Views: 2631

The recent Patch 8.4 came in with an interesting update for Shaman as Jade Spirit now belongs to the Elemental tribe. Therefore, mixing the Jade package with Elemental synergies feels smoother than before and many players are toying around this. Today we are taking a look at a variant that makes use of this change to justify the inclusion of Kalimos, Primal Lord without going too deep on the Elemental synergies, keeping open spots for

Aretuza Journals #10: Resource Management
Author: Gravez
Views: 150

Every game of Gwent is essentially a careful balancing of resources and proper usage and sequencing of every play. Albeit lacking any sort of mana system, the resource management in Gwent can prove to be a   difficult task. As there is no mana costs or mana curve, the hand size is much larger and the percentage of the deck one can see during the game is bigger, each play carries a greater impact. Lorenzo Mastroianni

The Meta Structure & Aggro Decks
Author: Pestilentio
Views: 478

Art by Gromitzy There was a point in which every player has come to hate the overly aggressive decks. If you’ve never played an aggro deck and you keep facing them while laddering, there is a high chance that you’ll think you keep losing to “no-brain” SMOrcing. However, not only are aggro decks hard to pilot over a high amount of games, but they also define the meta structure in a way that usually no

Are razer products good?







-Zombie-Apr 9, 2012, 1:39 AM

    I really like the design of Razer's mice but their keyboards look like overpriced junk (Correct me if I'm wrong), I'm wondering if their products back up their price tags?Logitech G500 VS Razer Mamba, Naga, & Deathadder?orLogitech VS Razer in general.I do like Razer's mouse pads though, really good quality especially the extended golithaous.

More about razer products good









constepatdyakApr 9, 2012, 1:56 AM

    Razer keyboards are gimmicky for me...used a lycosa and the coating on the keycaps wore off. The mice however, are great. Im using a Mamba right now, very precise and a grreat mouse. So: Keyboard-LogitechMice: RazerJust my 2cents











mercer95Apr 9, 2012, 2:16 AM

    They are supposed to be but I think that they are a little over priced for the features you get, and IMO I don’t like the look of most of their gear.

    I'm personally never going to buy another Razer product again since I've found higher quality parts among other brands.I owned two Razer mice (Naga + DeathAdder) and the drivers on my PC killed both mice within 30 mins. Good thing both mice weren't in the warranty period /s.Switched to a Cyborg RAT 5 and can't use another mouse. You get such an extremely customized feel that it seems like the mouse was built to fit your hand from the start. The RAT 7 is personally what I would spend my money on now, since you get an adjustable thumb and pinky rest in addition to the adjustable palm and weights in the RAT 5. Aside from that, the really key difference for me was that the RATs are machined from aluminum and the Razers are made of plastic, yet you pay about the same for each. I'm betting it costs Razer ~$20 to make an $80 mouse...As for keyboards, I'd go Logitech or some other brand. Mechanical keyboards are worth looking into if you're looking for a good board (again, I would avoid the Razer Blackwidow - heard of issues with the keys and the firmware from time to time).











mercer95Apr 9, 2012, 3:09 AM

    +1^^^^^^^^^^^^i have the rat 5 to and i love it, also you can turn the rat 5 into the rat 7 by unscrewing a few screws and buying the spare parts.











-Zombie-Apr 9, 2012, 3:18 AM

    The cyborg's design is just way to crazy for me even though I've heard nothing but good things about them.I have to admit that the lycossa interests me a good bit, just for the aesthetics, the ability to program any key to be macro compatible, and the slim keys, but I've heard so many horror stories about it that I doubt I could bring myself to buy it.I'm looking into the Logitech G510 Keyboard right now, and the razer imperator. It seems like a solid choice but what  do you mean your drivers killed your mouse ??











mercer95Apr 9, 2012, 3:27 AM

    what kind of games will you be playing because there are mice designed for fps or rpg's

    The is a screw on the palm rest rail (the very small black ones) then when undone you can slide the rest back and forth or completely of, I have literally just done it although I figured that it was possible ages ago.

CandianoaktreeJul 26, 2014, 8:11 AM

    Razer is a very good brand, for the price though, I would suggest other brands, but some of the products are better and cheaper than other brands, (razer kraken vs turtle beach) but if you can afford it, and you are debating weather an expensive Logitech product, or a razer, I'd rather get the razer...

Razer equipment is really nice and good quality. Sound system is quiet good and easy to use. Mouses are a bit hard shape but u adjuste fast to them. Keyboards are are good too nice buttons hardness, backgourd lights and so on.

ttg_AvengedMay 24, 2015, 7:07 AM

    Only wanted to reply to add on to this three year old thread, because Razer has changed.Razer in 2012, was a sub-popular manufacter of a niche industry but now they create chairs, laptops, mice, headsets let's be nice, and just call them headsets), and EVEN backpacks... They will probably even have a VR set out soon, who knows. They are sort of like the Apple of pc gaming periphials, but without the crazy cost. (still costy, just not 300$ for a keyboard). They are setting up 'Razer Store' stores now, sort of like apple at malls. If you have never tried a Razer mouse or a Widow, please try it. I think the Deathadder will be my mouse for another 4-5 years or so. Their mouses, amazing. KBs, almost perfect. Headsets, pretty pathetic. Mousepads, pretty bad. (vespula is awful and over priced). Laptops, pretty great, nearly ASUS level of god tier-ness. Just don't get a headset or mousepad, and you will love Razer. (Full disclosure, I have a razer kb, m, mpad, and headset. Burned the mpad, and donated the headset to a hungry hobo.











Shadow_has_RisenDec 25, 2015, 12:38 PM

    Don't listen to these idiots, Razer is the best (probably cause i'm a fanboy) especially their chroma series. All these "overpriced" comments, just buy razer products from Centrecom as they are MUCH cheaper and very reliable. I went to JB HI FI and they were selling a Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Headset for $169 then I went over to Centrecom and they were selling it for $139! Now the Boxing Day sale is on and their selling the Deathadder Chroma for $59! Razer products are the best and forget Logitech as they are a heap of shit and are for cheapasses. Plasticky, gimmicky are all related to Logitech. By the way, I bought a Razer Deathadder from ebay and when I got it, it was fake. But it is very comfortable and it's lasted me for a whole year and still working great! But it's fake...

Doesn't necessarily reflect the product quality, but they seem like a pretty nasty place to work. Also, their products are mediocre, I have tried them and they are nothing more than mediocre. They look quite cool, but that's it imo. They're certainly not "specialist" anway

Good Gaming Inc. Announces Several Key Website Enhancements and Upgrades as the Company Approaches 30,000 Website Memberships 

Good Gaming To Debut Newly Modified BO3 GWENT Strike Application Over Next Several Days



CHICAGO, IL--(Marketwired - Jul 25, 2017) -  Good Gaming, Inc. (OTC PINK: GMER) (the "Company") owner and operator of the world's most scalable eSports tournament and social network platform for novice, competitive and professional electronic gamers, is pleased to announce several key website enhancements and upgrades as the Company approaches 30,000 memberships.
As the Company continues to show exceptional growth in memberships nearing almost 30,000 Good Gaming members, several enhancements and upgrades have been developed, and are in the process of being implemented, in order to increase micro-transactions, handle anticipated website traffic and enhance gamer experiences in order to extend a gamers engagement.
Recent website changes include upgrading the website infrastructure to 3rd Generation technologies as part of the Reskin project. This includes moving to asynchronous data saving for all actions on the website and allowing for data to be correct every time, so that there can be no jam up of data at the database. Adding to that, the Company is now delivering data to the actual page using an API, which will now allow the data to be pulled faster, and allow the Good Gaming website to move to more interactive and mobile UI/UX designs.
The Company has also identified a need for faster game play with its GWENT Tournament Series due to the recent popularity of its best of five (BO5) GWENT Strike Application and is pleased to announce it has modified a new best of three (BO3) Gwent Strike Application which will provide a faster game play experience with the same challenge and excitement experienced by all Good Gaming members. Tournament formats for BO5 GWENT Strike Application is already up and running with BO3 GWENT Strike Application expected to be available within the next several days and will only be available to Good Gaming members at www.good-gaming.com.
Gamers will also be pleased to know that Good Gaming is in the process of frameworking and starting on Deck Banning Apps. The Company plans to implement their Deck Banning Apps into the Tournament System, along with the GWENT Strike Application and Hearthstone Strike Application, so that players in Last Hero Standing or Conquest format tournaments can have an application to track banned decks and decks that have lost, thus giving Good Gaming members a significant competitive edge.
As previously reported, the global games market is expected to increase 7.8% to $108.9 billion with the eSport industry showing the fastest year over year growth within the industry at 41.3% in 2017. Industry analysts predict this type of exponential growth to continue through 2020.
David B. Dorwart, Good Gaming CEO, stated, "We are extremely pleased to be approaching the 30,000 membership mark on our website and should surpass this very important milestone within the next several days. Currently, we are increasing members at an average rate of approximately 150 memberships a day. We expect this average to continue to grow as Good Gaming continues to carve out a niche in the eSport industry. Our objective is to stay ahead of our growth curve by continuing to develop various ways to expand our game play through modification while investing in technologies that both engage and enhance Good Gaming's tournament play experience. We look forward to the continued implementation of our strategies in order to meet and exceed the goals set forth in our business model."
