Product details Thomas James


Thomas James

Samuel Drummond

A half-length portrait, very slightly to right, in a dark coat and white neckcloth, painted in about 1830. With short white hair, the sitter looks out of the picture space to meet the gaze of the viewer. For many years in the early part of the 19th century James held the position of Master Smith in the Royal Dockyard at Woolwich. The dockyard was founded in 1512, followed by a ropeyard half a mile away in 1610, it was particularly important during the 16th and 17th centuries. But its value gradually declined owing to limited space, facilities and the silting of the Thames. By 1800 it was restricted to shipbuilding; fitting vessels built at Deptford or merchant yards; and refitting small ships from the Nore. In 1839 a steam factory was established at Woolwich. The ropeyard closed 1835 and the yard in 1869.Samuel Drummond

As an Agent of New York Life Insurance Company and Registered Representative with NYLIFE Securities LLC, I can offer you the following:  Life Insurance: Life insurance is an effective way to help protect your family's lifestyle and future. Plus the cash value in a whole life insurance policy can be accessed via policy loans to help you supplement your retirement income when your protection needs decrease*. This cash value can also be accessed for other major life events and can play an important part in business succession or charitable giving plans*.Long-Term Care Insurance: Going through life may require a little help along the way. So if you're planning ahead, long-term care insurance may help protect you or a family member's future plans and help preserve the assets you've worked so hard to build.Retirement Income: Preparing for retirement is easier with the help of our guaranteed^ lifetime income annuity products. You can select an immediate annuity1 that pays income right away, or a tax-deferred fixed annuity1 that allows you to set aside money until you need it2. Either way, you will be assured a steady, dependable source of income for life.Investments# - We offer products and services to help you develop a sound, long-term investment strategy. You can choose from over 10,000 mutual funds, including self-directed, tax-deferred Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). We also offer products to fund plans for companies of all sizes, ranging from SIMPLE IRAs to full-service defined contribution and defined benefit plans.Other Products: We have established relationships with other carriers, and can supply you with information on disability income insurance as well as individual and group health insurance products3. If we don't offer it, chances are we can assist you.To learn more about our products and services, please feel free to give me a call or request a free consultation. I'll be happy to answer all your questions. *Policy loans will accrue interest. Any outstanding loans plus interest will reduce the cash value and death benefit of the policy.^Guarantees are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuer. #Securities products and services are offered through NYLIFE Securities LLC (Member FINRA/SIPC), a Licensed Insurance Agency.1Issued by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (A Delaware Corporation)2Early withdrawals may incur charges. In addition to paying income taxes that maybe due, distributions from annuities before age 591/2 may also be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty.3Products available through one or more carriers not affiliated with New York Life, dependent on carrier authorization and product availability in your state or locality.

 Research Description

                    Antibody production, or humoral immunity,  is a highly effective mechanism for host defense because the developing B cell repertoire generates an enormous number of immune receptors that become immune effectors as antibodies.  Because many of the immune receptors produced during B cell development also react with self antigens (i.e. are autoreactive), mechanisms are necessary to prevent the emergence of potentially toxic B cell clones and antibodies.  The mechanisms that maintain this autoreactivity in check are broadly termed â€œimmune tolerance.â€  Every immune response must first negotiate checkpoints of immune tolerance before effective host defense can be generated. In autoimmune diseases, these checkpoints fail and autoagressive clones emerge. Among these,  loss of B cell tolerance as manifest by anti-insulin antibodies is a harbinger of autoimmune beta cell destruction in the pancreas that causes type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes. To study this event at the cellular and molecular level, our laboratory has generated mice that harbor insulin autoantibodies as B cell receptor transgenes. T1D prone NOD mice that harbor an Ig heavy chain transgene permit us to investigate a population of insulin binding B cells in the repertoire. We find that these insulin specific B cells promote T1D in the NOD mouse model. In addition, we have discovered that some of these B cells invade islets and express receptors that may bind antigens other than insulin. Capturing the antigen receptors on these B cells provides a means to discover new beta cell autoantigens that are targets in T1D.  Further, a new line of transgenic mice is being generated in which the anti-insulin V regions are targeted to the Ig locus. Studies in these will identify, for the first time, when and where immune tolerance is lost, allowing anti-insulin B cells to undergo class switch recombination and differentiation into antibody producing cells. Studies in the laboratory investigate how the action of helper and regulatory T cells alter this critical immune response.
