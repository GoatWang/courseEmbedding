History[edit]
The Catholic Volksbank van Leuven, founded in 1889, was one of the earliest predecessors of the KBC Bank. Another predecessor was the Bremer Vorschussverein, founded in 1889 and changed later into Bankverein Bremen AG. In 1935, the banks Algemeene Bankvereeniging and Volksbank van Leuven merged with the Bank voor Handel en Nijverheid to create the Kredietbank. The Kredietbank would be the only Belgian financial institution under Flemish control which would survive the financial crisis of the great depression of the 1930s. Fernand Collin, who became president in 1938, conceived the business strategy which would lead to the growth of the bank. He defined the Kredietbank as an independent bank with a decidedly Flemish character which would be an instrument to further Flemish economic growth.
During World War II, the bank would be able to expand its activities and grow its deposits from the Flemish middle class. After the war, because of the economic recovery, the Kredietbank, now the third largest bank in Belgium, was able to increase the number of operating branches in Flanders. The postwar growth strategy of the bank, emphasized foreign expansion and the development of portfolio-management services for investors. The bank expanded into Luxembourg in 1949 with the Kredietbank S.A. Luxembourgeoise and into Wallonia with the establishment of the Crédit Général de Belgique in 1961.
The Kredietbank also expanded into Belgian Congo. It established a branch in Léopoldville in 1952. Then in 1954 it acquired Banque Congolaise pour l’Industrie, le Commerce, et l’Agriculture and renamed it Kredietbank-Congo,[2] Ultimately it had four branches, one each in Léopoldville, Bukavu, Elizabethville and Stanleyville. Due the situation emerging after the independence of Belgian Congo in 1960, the bank discontinued its Congolese operations in 1966.
In the sixties, driven by increasing competition, the bank worked on the expansion of its branch network and improvement of consumer services. In 1966, the bank began building a foreign-correspondent network and the establishment of foreign branches in New York, London, the Cayman Islands, and a subsidiary in Geneva, the Kredietbank (Suisse) S.A.. In 1970, together with six other European institutions, Kredietbank established the Inter-Alpha Group of Banks. The Kredietbank N.V. Bruxelles acquired the main part of the shares from the Bankverein Bremen AG since 1982. The branch in Bremen was renamed to Kredietbank-Bankverein AG in 1990.[3]
In 1998, the Kredietbank merged with two financial institutions originating from the Boerenbond (Vlaanderen) (nl) (E: Belgian Catholic Farmers Association), ABB-insurance (Assurances du Boerenbond Belge) and CERA (Centrale Raiffeisenkas) Bank, to form the 'KBC Bank and Insurance Holding Company'. Since then, the group has significantly expanded its activities, chiefly in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2005, KBC set another milestone by merging with its parent company, Almanij, and changing its name to KBC Groep NV (nl).
Over the past decade, KBC has built up a strong presence in many of the countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004 (Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics) by investing some 7.4 billion euros in acquisitions. More recently (2007), KBC has made acquisitions in Bulgaria (DZI Insurance, DZI Invest and EIBANK), Romania (KBC Securities Romania, Romstal Leasing and INK Insurance Broker), Russia (Absolut Bank), Serbia (KBC Banka and Senzal, now KBC Securities AD Beograd, Hipobroker, now KBC Broker, and Bastion, now KBC Securities Corporate Finance) and Slovakia (Istrobanka).
After receiving government support during the financial crisis, the bank embarked on a divestment programme to satisfy the requirements of the European Commission. As such, it has sold or is planning to sell several subsidiaries, such as Centea, Fidea, Kredyt Bank, ADB, KBC Deutschland, and KBL epb (Krediet Bank Luxembourgeoise), its network of European private banking subsidiaries.

KBC Bank NV
KBC Insurance NV
KBC Asset Management NV
Kredietbank SA Luxembourgeoise

All other KBC Group companies are direct or indirect subsidiaries of these.
KBC Bank NV[edit]
KBC Bank is the main subsidiary. Its first home market is Belgium, where it is one of the top three banks, with a 20-25% market share and over three million customers (counting the customers of the subsidiaries in Belgium).

With effect from July 2008, KBC Bank has acquired another small Slovak Bank, Istrobanka.[4] In all of these countries except Poland, KBC Bank is a top-4 player by market share. It also has a substantial presence in Ireland through its subsidiary KBC Bank Ireland (formerly IIB Bank), which is a major player in both the corporate and residential mortgage markets there. In all, KBC Bank has established a presence in some thirty countries around the globe. In 2007, KBC expanded its presence to Eastern Europe through the acquisition of DZI Insurance and CIBank in Bulgaria.
KBC Project Finance is a subsidiary of KBC Bank, and has been an active player in the non-recourse financing of projects since the early 1990s. Headquartered in Dublin, it also has professionals based in London, Brussels, New York, Hong Kong, and Sydney. Its main business lines are Energy and Infrastructure. This includes financing projects in sectors such as the oil & gas industry, power, renewable energy, and Public-Private Partnership. It has a portfolio in excess of US$5bn, financing approximately 250 projects worldwide.
KBC Bank also has investment banking operations in Europe, US and Asia. A specialist arm called KBC Financial Products operates primarily in global convertible bonds; its branch in Japan is called KBC Securities Japan, which specialises in secondary equity broking, convertible bonds, warrants, and equity derivatives.
Kredietbank SA Luxembourgeoise - European Private Bankers (KBL)[edit]
KBL European Private Bankers is no longer a subsidiary of KBC since a sale was agreed to Precision Capital for a reported €1.05 Billion.

In September 2013, KBC agreed the sale of its German unit, KBC Deutschland, to several investors, including affiliates of Teacher Retirement System of Texas, Apollo Global Management, Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, and Grovepoint Capital.[5]
In December 2016, KBC announced that it would acquire United Bulgarian Bank, making KBC the largest bank-insurance group in the country.[6]

History[edit]
The Catholic Volksbank van Leuven, founded in 1889, was one of the earliest predecessors of the KBC Bank. Another predecessor was the Bremer Vorschussverein, founded in 1889 and changed later into Bankverein Bremen AG. In 1935, the banks Algemeene Bankvereeniging and Volksbank van Leuven merged with the Bank voor Handel en Nijverheid to create the Kredietbank. The Kredietbank would be the only Belgian financial institution under Flemish control which would survive the financial crisis of the great depression of the 1930s. Fernand Collin, who became president in 1938, conceived the business strategy which would lead to the growth of the bank. He defined the Kredietbank as an independent bank with a decidedly Flemish character which would be an instrument to further Flemish economic growth.
During World War II, the bank would be able to expand its activities and grow its deposits from the Flemish middle class. After the war, because of the economic recovery, the Kredietbank, now the third largest bank in Belgium, was able to increase the number of operating branches in Flanders. The postwar growth strategy of the bank, emphasized foreign expansion and the development of portfolio-management services for investors. The bank expanded into Luxembourg in 1949 with the Kredietbank S.A. Luxembourgeoise and into Wallonia with the establishment of the Crédit Général de Belgique in 1961.
The Kredietbank also expanded into Belgian Congo. It established a branch in Léopoldville in 1952. Then in 1954 it acquired Banque Congolaise pour l’Industrie, le Commerce, et l’Agriculture and renamed it Kredietbank-Congo,[2] Ultimately it had four branches, one each in Léopoldville, Bukavu, Elizabethville and Stanleyville. Due the situation emerging after the independence of Belgian Congo in 1960, the bank discontinued its Congolese operations in 1966.
In the sixties, driven by increasing competition, the bank worked on the expansion of its branch network and improvement of consumer services. In 1966, the bank began building a foreign-correspondent network and the establishment of foreign branches in New York, London, the Cayman Islands, and a subsidiary in Geneva, the Kredietbank (Suisse) S.A.. In 1970, together with six other European institutions, Kredietbank established the Inter-Alpha Group of Banks. The Kredietbank N.V. Bruxelles acquired the main part of the shares from the Bankverein Bremen AG since 1982. The branch in Bremen was renamed to Kredietbank-Bankverein AG in 1990.[3]
In 1998, the Kredietbank merged with two financial institutions originating from the Boerenbond (Vlaanderen) (nl) (E: Belgian Catholic Farmers Association), ABB-insurance (Assurances du Boerenbond Belge) and CERA (Centrale Raiffeisenkas) Bank, to form the 'KBC Bank and Insurance Holding Company'. Since then, the group has significantly expanded its activities, chiefly in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2005, KBC set another milestone by merging with its parent company, Almanij, and changing its name to KBC Groep NV (nl).
Over the past decade, KBC has built up a strong presence in many of the countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004 (Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics) by investing some 7.4 billion euros in acquisitions. More recently (2007), KBC has made acquisitions in Bulgaria (DZI Insurance, DZI Invest and EIBANK), Romania (KBC Securities Romania, Romstal Leasing and INK Insurance Broker), Russia (Absolut Bank), Serbia (KBC Banka and Senzal, now KBC Securities AD Beograd, Hipobroker, now KBC Broker, and Bastion, now KBC Securities Corporate Finance) and Slovakia (Istrobanka).
After receiving government support during the financial crisis, the bank embarked on a divestment programme to satisfy the requirements of the European Commission. As such, it has sold or is planning to sell several subsidiaries, such as Centea, Fidea, Kredyt Bank, ADB, KBC Deutschland, and KBL epb (Krediet Bank Luxembourgeoise), its network of European private banking subsidiaries.

KBC Bank N.V. is a Belgian universal multi-channel bank, focusing on private clients and small and medium-sized enterprises. Besides retail banking, insurance and asset management activities (in collaboration with sister companies KBC Insurance NV and KBC Asset Management NV), KBC is active in European debt capital markets, domestic cash equity markets and in the field of corporate banking, leasing, factoring, reinsurance, private equity and project and trade finance in Belgium, Central and Eastern Europe and elsewhere (mainly in Europe). KBC is an acronym for Kredietbank ABB Insurance CERA Bank.
The parent company, KBC Group N.V., is one of the major companies and the second largest bancassurer in Belgium. It is the 18th largest bank in Europe (by market capitalisation) and a major financial player in Central and Eastern Europe, employing some 51,000 staff worldwide (of which 31,000 in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia) and serving 11 million customers worldwide (some 8 million in Central and Eastern Europe).
The group is controlled by a syndicate of core shareholders, but has a free float of some 41%. In the core shareholders, KBC Ancora controls 23%, MRBB (part of the Flemish farmers' association) controls around 13%, CERA (the largest cooperative in Wallonia) 7% and a group of industrialist families controls another 11%.[1] The free float was chiefly held by a large variety of international institutional investors (close to 45% UK-or US-based) as of the end of 2010. Its shares are traded on the Euronext exchange in Brussels and the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
The group's overall aim is to be an independent, medium-sized provider of bancassurance for private clients and enterprises in selected European countries, with a focus on asset management and in financial markets.
The private Art collection of KBC bank is situated in the Rockox House in Antwerp.

History[edit]
The Catholic Volksbank van Leuven, founded in 1889, was one of the earliest predecessors of the KBC Bank. Another predecessor was the Bremer Vorschussverein, founded in 1889 and changed later into Bankverein Bremen AG. In 1935, the banks Algemeene Bankvereeniging and Volksbank van Leuven merged with the Bank voor Handel en Nijverheid to create the Kredietbank. The Kredietbank would be the only Belgian financial institution under Flemish control which would survive the financial crisis of the great depression of the 1930s. Fernand Collin, who became president in 1938, conceived the business strategy which would lead to the growth of the bank. He defined the Kredietbank as an independent bank with a decidedly Flemish character which would be an instrument to further Flemish economic growth.
During World War II, the bank would be able to expand its activities and grow its deposits from the Flemish middle class. After the war, because of the economic recovery, the Kredietbank, now the third largest bank in Belgium, was able to increase the number of operating branches in Flanders. The postwar growth strategy of the bank, emphasized foreign expansion and the development of portfolio-management services for investors. The bank expanded into Luxembourg in 1949 with the Kredietbank S.A. Luxembourgeoise and into Wallonia with the establishment of the Crédit Général de Belgique in 1961.
The Kredietbank also expanded into Belgian Congo. It established a branch in Léopoldville in 1952. Then in 1954 it acquired Banque Congolaise pour l’Industrie, le Commerce, et l’Agriculture and renamed it Kredietbank-Congo,[2] Ultimately it had four branches, one each in Léopoldville, Bukavu, Elizabethville and Stanleyville. Due the situation emerging after the independence of Belgian Congo in 1960, the bank discontinued its Congolese operations in 1966.
In the sixties, driven by increasing competition, the bank worked on the expansion of its branch network and improvement of consumer services. In 1966, the bank began building a foreign-correspondent network and the establishment of foreign branches in New York, London, the Cayman Islands, and a subsidiary in Geneva, the Kredietbank (Suisse) S.A.. In 1970, together with six other European institutions, Kredietbank established the Inter-Alpha Group of Banks. The Kredietbank N.V. Bruxelles acquired the main part of the shares from the Bankverein Bremen AG since 1982. The branch in Bremen was renamed to Kredietbank-Bankverein AG in 1990.[3]
In 1998, the Kredietbank merged with two financial institutions originating from the Boerenbond (Vlaanderen) (nl) (E: Belgian Catholic Farmers Association), ABB-insurance (Assurances du Boerenbond Belge) and CERA (Centrale Raiffeisenkas) Bank, to form the 'KBC Bank and Insurance Holding Company'. Since then, the group has significantly expanded its activities, chiefly in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2005, KBC set another milestone by merging with its parent company, Almanij, and changing its name to KBC Groep NV (nl).
Over the past decade, KBC has built up a strong presence in many of the countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004 (Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics) by investing some 7.4 billion euros in acquisitions. More recently (2007), KBC has made acquisitions in Bulgaria (DZI Insurance, DZI Invest and EIBANK), Romania (KBC Securities Romania, Romstal Leasing and INK Insurance Broker), Russia (Absolut Bank), Serbia (KBC Banka and Senzal, now KBC Securities AD Beograd, Hipobroker, now KBC Broker, and Bastion, now KBC Securities Corporate Finance) and Slovakia (Istrobanka).
After receiving government support during the financial crisis, the bank embarked on a divestment programme to satisfy the requirements of the European Commission. As such, it has sold or is planning to sell several subsidiaries, such as Centea, Fidea, Kredyt Bank, ADB, KBC Deutschland, and KBL epb (Krediet Bank Luxembourgeoise), its network of European private banking subsidiaries.
Structure and main subsidiaries[edit]
KBC Group NV is the direct parent company of:

KBC Bank NV
KBC Insurance NV
KBC Asset Management NV
Kredietbank SA Luxembourgeoise
ValueSource Technologies, Chennai, INDIA

All other KBC Group companies are direct or indirect subsidiaries of these.
KBC Bank NV[edit]
KBC Bank is the main subsidiary. Its first home market is Belgium, where it is one of the top three banks, with a 20-25% market share and over three million customers (counting the customers of the subsidiaries in Belgium). Its second home market is Central Europe, served via subsidiaries and investments in the Czech Republic (ČSOB), Slovakia (ČSOB), Hungary (K&H Bank), Poland (Kredyt Bank) and Slovenia (Nova Ljubljanska Banka). With effect from July 2008, KBC Bank has acquired another small Slovak Bank, Istrobanka.[4] In all of these countries except Poland, KBC Bank is a top-4 player by market share. It also has a substantial presence in Ireland through its subsidiary KBC Bank Ireland (formerly IIB Bank), which is a major player in both the corporate and residential mortgage markets there. In all, KBC Bank has established a presence in some thirty countries around the globe. In 2007, KBC expanded its presence to Eastern Europe through the acquisition of DZI Insurance and CIBank in Bulgaria.
KBC Project Finance is a subsidiary of KBC Bank, and has been an active player in the non-recourse financing of projects since the early 1990s. Headquartered in Dublin, it also has professionals based in London, Brussels, New York, Hong Kong, and Sydney. Its main business lines are Energy and Infrastructure. This includes financing projects in sectors such as the oil & gas industry, power, renewable energy, and Public-Private Partnership. It has a portfolio in excess of US$5bn, financing approximately 250 projects worldwide.
KBC Bank also has investment banking operations in Europe, US and Asia. A specialist arm called KBC Financial Products operates primarily in global convertible bonds; its branch in Japan is called KBC Securities Japan, which specialises in secondary equity broking, convertible bonds, warrants, and equity derivatives.
Kredietbank SA Luxembourgeoise - European Private Bankers (KBL)[edit]
KBL European Private Bankers is no longer a subsidiary of KBC since a sale was agreed to Precision Capital for a reported €1.05 Billion.
Recent news[edit]
In September 2013, KBC agreed the sale of its German unit, KBC Deutschland, to several investors, including affiliates of Teacher Retirement System of Texas, Apollo Global Management, Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, and Grovepoint Capital.[5]
In December 2016, KBC announced that it would acquire United Bulgarian Bank, making KBC the largest bank-insurance group in the country.[6]

KBC Group NV



09/08/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 09/08/2016 09:08
KBC compliments its product range for young drivers







      Press release
    

      Brussels, 8 September 2016
    

      KBC compliments its product range for young drivers
    

      Young people become conscious drivers thanks to KBC DriveSafe app
    

      KBC has launched KBC DriveSafe, an app that monitors the driving style of young drivers who have just got their driving licence. This completes KBC's full range of products and services helping young people to be well prepared and stay safe on the road. In doing so, KBC also aims to contribute towards prevention in the broad sense of the word. KBC DriveSafe also fits in KBC Mobility, a strategic programme launched in April 2016 by VAB, KBC Insurance and KBC Autolease to develop sustainable, quality mobility solutions in Belgium.
    

      KBC DriveSafe is aimed at young drivers who have just got their driving licence. Accident statistics1 show that 20-to-24-year-olds are at highest risk of being involved in an accident.
    

      In 2014, 24.7% of motorists in Belgium who died in an accident were young drivers between the ages of 18 and 24. The latest figures of BRSI show a decline in mortal accidents during the weekend but a stagnation during the week. Driver awareness is particularly relevant to young, male road users.
    

      KBC DriveSafe tells young drivers how they are driving and how they can improve this. They can share general details of their driving with a coach like one of their parents, facilitating discussion on and encouraging safe driving (helping parents rest a little easier). A win-win situation for all concerned, as research has shown that risk of accidents is reduced when driving is monitored.
    

      Hans Verstraete, CEO of KBC Insurance: 'This app compliments KBC's range for younger road users and helps prevent accidents, a top priority for us as an insurer that takes its social responsibility very seriously. KBC is convinced that the KBC DriveSafe app can make a positive contribution to mobility and road safety. As such it fits perfectly within the strategic program KBC Mobility, a program recently launched to respond better to a number of societal trends and technological developments that play an important role in developing solutions to mobility issues today."
    

      Full range for young motorists
    

      The KBC website gives future drivers lots of useful information and access to a comprehensive range of relevant products. This includes practical details of getting your driving licence through a driving school or otherwise. There are also ten short videos to help prepare for driving lessons.
    

      1 Source: Jaarrapport Verkeersveiligheid 2014


      Help getting a provisional driving licence
    

      The first step to obtaining a driving licence is passing the driving theory test. Our KBC Drive smartphone app lets you easily prepare for this wherever and whenever suits you best. Those who prefer to practice for their driving theory test using their computer can do so on the VAB website. The app is already proving very popular with more than 47 000 downloads to date.
    

      Driving unaccompanied
    

      The first few months driving alone can be the most dangerous for younger drivers, who are inexperienced in traffic and sometimes underestimate or wrongly read risky situations. KBC DriveSafe can help them with this, rating and giving them feedback on their driving based on their speed control, eco-driving (avoiding harsh acceleration and braking) and undistracted driving skills.
    

      The app also features the ability to share driving details with a coach like a parent (see demo). Coaches can reward their driver for their driving, encouraging and further promoting safe driving. The app also includes some extras like a discounted VAB refresher course or Proximus phone plan, not to mention competitions with attractive prizes. KBC DriveSafe can be downloaded for 4.99 euros (from now for Android versions 4 and 5 and soon available in the App Store).
    

      DriveSafe app technical requirements
    

      The app is available for iPhones running iOS 8 or 9 and smartphones running Android 4 or 5.
    

      Sharing details of your journeys to get feedback on your driving requires a 3G, 4G or Wi-Fi data connection.
    

      Affordable insurance
    

      Newly qualified drivers can get properly insured by taking out insurance themselves or being included under their parents' policy. The latter can be done free of charge for the first two years after getting your provisional driving licence under KBC Start2Drive cover.
    

      Young people who buy their own car sometimes have trouble finding insurance that suits their budget. If their parents insure with KBC, they may be able to get the benefits of KBC MyFirstCar cover. This special insurance package is made for 18-to-29-year-olds who already have some driving experience and who want to insure their car in their own name for the first time.
    

      To be eligible for the cover:
    



          Young drivers must have been on their parents' motor insurance for at least a year
        



          Parents need to have car, family and home insurance with KBC
        



      If you would like to test the app yourself, don't hesitate to contact us
