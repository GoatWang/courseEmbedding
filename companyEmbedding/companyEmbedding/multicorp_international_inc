A Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State, on November 7, 2008, changing the Company’s name to BWI Holdings, Inc. A Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State, on January 27, 2011, changing the Company’s name to Aquasil International Inc. On May 22, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a name change to Multi-Corp International Inc. (the “Company”).







	On December 30, 2010, the Company entered into a stock exchange agreement (the “Stock Exchange Agreement”) with AquaSil, Inc., a New York corporation (“AquaSil”) and the sole stockholder of AquaSil. In accordance with the Stock Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of AquaSil in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate 70,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the sole stockholder of AquaSil. As a result of this transaction, AquaSil became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.







	The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, AquaSil, was incorporated in the State of New York on September 21, 2010 to engage in the business of selling various water and soft drink products. The operations were consolidated until the entity was disposed on March 31, 2012.








	On May 22, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to implement a reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock at a ratio of 1000:1 and to file all required documents to the requisite regulatory authorities to implement the reverse split.

	All share and per share data included in this report is consistent with the implementation of the reverse split.







	On December 17, 2012, we entered into two agreements (the “Agreements”) with Quad Energy Corp., a Nevada Corporation (“Quad”) whereby we will acquire a 100% Working Interest and Revenue Interests ranging from 61.96% to 70.5% in the 2,800 acre Cave Pool Property in Eddy County, New Mexico which have an estimated 51  identified drilling and recompletion locations, of which 14 were proved undeveloped, and all of the production equipment on the Property including all of the pump jacks, storage tanks, and batteries.







	Basis of Presentation







	The Company is in the development stage and has no revenues. A development stage company is one in which all efforts are devoted substantially to establishing a new business and even if planned principal operations have commenced, revenues are insignificant.







	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Multi-Corp International Inc. and up to March 31, 2012 includes the accounts of AquaSil. The operations were consolidated until the entity was disposed on March 31, 2012.







	Note 2 — GOING CONCERN







	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company is a development stage company and is dependent on raising capital to commence principal operations. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  Management believes the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise capital. At present, the Company has no commitments for any additional financing. Management is currently seeking financing through a possible offering of common stock, which will be used to finance operations. Until such financing is obtained, it is the intent of stockholders to provide funds for professional fees related to maintaining the Company’s public reporting status.







	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)







	Note 3 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates, which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates.







	The financial statements have, in management’s opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below:







	Reclassifications







	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. There was no material effect to the consolidated financial statements as a result of these reclassifications.







	Cash and Cash Equivalents







	Cash and cash equivalents consist of commercial accounts and interest-bearing bank deposits and are carried at cost, which approximates current value. Items are considered to be cash equivalents if the original maturity is three months or less.







	Equipment and Facilities







	Equipment and facilities are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from one to twenty-five years.








	Intangible Assets









	Acquired intangible assets are recognized at cost and are classified as assets with finite useful lives. The Company amortizes the intangible assets with five years using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets. Intangible assets

	are evaluated for impairment to determine if current circumstances and market conditions indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company recognized an impairment loss of $69,067 on the intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2012.







	Asset Retirement Obligations







	The Company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the well is spud or the asset is acquired and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, a gain or loss is recognized.







	Full Cost Method







	The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations whereby all costs related to the exploration and development of oil and gas properties are initially capitalized into a single cost center by country ("full cost pool"). At March 31, 2013, the Company had one cost center  in the  United States.







	All capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit-of-production method using estimates of proved reserves once proved reserves are determined to exist. At March 31, 2013, there was no amortization of these costs due to there being no production.

	Note 3 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)







	Full Cost Method (continued)







	Unproved property costs are excluded from the amortization base until determination of the existence of proved reserves on the respective property or until the requirement for impairment. Unproved properties are reviewed at the end of each quarter to determine whether portions of the costs should be reclassified to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization. Sales of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to the net full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized, unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves.







	Capitalized costs are summarized as follows for the periods ended March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively:

	Capitalized costs of oil and gas properties (net of related deferred income taxes) may not exceed an amount equal to the present value, discounted at 10% per annum, of the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves plus the cost of unproved properties (adjusted for related income tax effects). Should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling, impairment is recognized. The present value of estimated future net cash flows is computed by applying the arithmetic average first day price of oil and natural gas for the preceding twelve months to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the end of the period, less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Such present value of proved reserves' future net cash flows excludes future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations. Should this comparison indicate an excess carrying value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment expense. We recognized $0 and $7,815,693 of impairment costs during the periods ended March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.












	Impairment






	FASB ASC 360-10-35-21 requires that assets to be held and used be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Oil and gas properties accounted for using the full cost method of accounting (which the Company uses) are excluded from this requirement but continue to be subject to the full cost method's impairment rules.







	Revenue recognition







	The Company recognizes oil and natural gas revenues from our interests in producing wells when production is delivered to, and title has transferred to, the purchaser and to the extent the selling price is reasonably determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Gas-balancing arrangements are accounted for using the sales method.








	Fair Value of Financial Instruments









	The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:









	Level 1- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.

	Note 3 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)








	Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)









	Level 2- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.









	Level 3- Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information,









	The carrying value of all assets and liabilities approximated their fair values as of March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, respectively.

	Stock-Based Compensation









	The Company follows the guidance included in ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”) using the modified prospective transition method. The Company recognizes compensation expense in the financial statements for share-based awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards.








	Income Taxes







	The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740,

	Income Taxes

	. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statements and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is recorded for the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the period increased or decreased by the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period.

	Note 3 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)







	Use of Estimates







	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known. The estimates on depreciation were based on the estimated useful lives of the Company's assets. Any estimates during the period have had an immaterial effect on earnings.







	Earnings or Loss Per Share







	The Company accounts for earnings per share pursuant ASC 260,

	Earnings per Share

	, which require disclosure on the financial statements of “basic” and “diluted” earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. During the periods ended March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 the Company had no common stock equivalents outstanding. Due to this, as well as the net losses reported for these years, the basic loss per share was the same as the diluted loss per share.








	Recent Accounting Pronouncements








	In February 2013, FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications. Other comprehensive income includes gains and losses that are initially excluded from net income for an accounting period. Those gains and losses are later reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income. The amendments in the ASU do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. All of the information that this ASU requires already is required to be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements under U.S. GAAP. The new amendments will require an organization to:











	-  






	Present (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes) the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income - but only if the item reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period; and















	-  






	Cross-reference to other disclosures currently required under U.S. GAAP for other reclassification items (that are not required under U.S. GAAP) to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. This would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is initially transferred to a balance sheet account (e.g., inventory for pension-related amounts) instead of directly to income or expense.











	The amendments apply to all public and private companies that report items of other comprehensive income. Public companies are required to comply with these amendments for all reporting periods (interim and annual). The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, for public companies. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2013-02 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.




	In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01,

	Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

	, which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements originally established by ASU 2011-11.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)








	The new ASU addresses preparer concerns that the scope of the disclosure requirements under ASU 2011-11 was overly broad and imposed unintended costs that were not commensurate with estimated benefits to financial statement users. In choosing to narrow the scope of the offsetting disclosures, the Board determined that it could make them more operable and cost effective for preparers while still giving financial statement users sufficient information to analyze the most significant presentation differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and those prepared under




	IFRSs. Like ASU 2011-11, the amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning on, or after January 1, 2013. The adoption of ASU 2013-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.







	Note 4 — ACQUISITION OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES




	 




	On December 17, 2012, the Company entered into two agreements (the “Agreements”) with Quad Energy Corp., a Nevada Corporation (“Quad”) whereby we acquired a 100% Working Interest and Revenue Interests ranging from 61.96% to 70.5% in the 2,800 acre Cave Pool Property in Eddy County, New Mexico which includes shut-in oil wells that had produced from the Grayburg sands, with an estimated 51 identified drilling and recompletion locations, of which 14 are proved undeveloped




	and all of the production equipment on the Property including all of the pump jacks, storage tanks, and batteries.  The Company’s plan is to re-drill and bring production back online.



	 



	The consideration paid for the interests was by way of the issuance of a total of 12,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company at a price of $1.60 per share which was the closing trade price of the shares on the date of the agreements, for a total value of $19,200,000. Asset retirement obligation associated with the acquisition was $1,175,635.







	Due to the reserves acquired being considered shut-in and re-drilling required to produce, the acquired wells were considered undeveloped. Given the undeveloped nature of the property this was considered an asset acquisition.







	The Company received reserve evaluation reports on its oil property in the Cave Pool field in Eddy County, New Mexico, USA from a third party. As a result of this review, management determined to impair the asset in order to reflect the value of the third party appraisal report.







	The following table summarizes our capitalized costs for the purchase and development of our oil and gas properties for the periods ended March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012:

As a result, impairment was recorded for December 31, 2012 in the amount of $7,815,693.  There was no further impairment resulting from March 31, 2013 full cost ceiling test.

	The Company has asset retirement obligations associated with the future plugging and abandonment of proved properties and related facilities. Under the provisions of FASB ASC 410-20-25, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, a gain or loss is recognized. The Company has no assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations.







	The following table summarizes the Company’s asset retirement obligation transactions recorded in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 410-20-25 during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and  years ended December 31, 2012:

	Summary









	The Company with its recent acquisition of certain oil and gas assets located in New Mexico, has determined to pursue operations in the oil and gas business.     However, the Company still holds the marketing and licensing of its proprietary software EviCAT which it acquired in February, 2012, but has no plans at this time to further that segment of its business.









	Liquidity & Capital Resources








	We are development stage Company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas projects. As at March 31, 2013, we have not generated any revenues.







	We had no cash on hand at either March 31, 2013 or December 31, 2012.   Our total assets as at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were $12,559,942.  Our assets as at March 31, 2013 consist of the valuation of our oil and gas working interest in the Cave Pool Unit and the equipment on site.   We acquired these assets in late December, 2012.







	There were no significant changes to our current total liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2013  which were $485,742, a slight decrease over December 31, 2012 current total liabilities of $491,540.   The slight decrease was due to a decrease in short term notes payable from $152,753 at December 31, 2012 to $121,921 at March 31, 2013 as we settled debt by the issuance of shares; the decrease was offset by a slight increase in accounts payable from $195,741 at December 31, 2012 to $220,785 at March 31, 2013. Advances from stockholders remained constant for both periods at $143,046.






	 






	5








	 




	Our total liabilities were $1,685,019 at March 31, 2013 as compared to $1,670,782 as at December 31, 2012 brought about by an increase in our asset retirement obligation to $1,199,267 from $1,179,242 at December 31, 2012.







	We will require $6,250,000 over the next twelve month period to further our business plan, of which approximately $5,700,000 will be allocated to the drilling of 10 wells on our oil and gas leases, with the remaining $550,000 allocated for expenses related to the payment requirements related to our oil and gas assets, our public reporting requirements and working capital.







	We do not have the funding required to meet our ongoing obligations or to fund our planned development.







	Our ability to meet our financial liabilities and commitments is dependent upon our ability to raise funding  which we expect will be raised by the  continued issuance of equity to new stockholders, the ability to borrow funds, and ultimately upon our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. There can be no assurance that financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.







	The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholder. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.







	Results of Operations







	We have changed our business plan with the acquisition of oil and gas assets in December, 2012 by the Company.   We do not have any revenues and have not had any revenue since inception on September 21, 2010.




	 


	 



	We have operating losses of $55,058 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to operating losses of $262,768 for the three months ended March 31, 2012, The substantial decrease in operating losses is mainly  due to the fact that  we had paid $250,000 in stock-based compensation expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2012 with no comparable expense for the comparable period ended March 31, 2013, as well as  a decrease to other general and administrative expenses from $256,718 which includes the $250,000 in stock based compensation (March 31, 2012) to $2,669 (March 31, 2013).  These reductions were offset by an increase in professional fees from $3,717 (2012) to $32,364 in the current three month period ended March 31, 2013 as well as $20,025 recorded as accretion of the discount asset retirement obligations in the current period, with no similar expense in the prior comparative period in 2012.   In the three months ended December 31, 2012 we reported amortization of intangible assets with no comparable expense in the three months ended December 31, 2013.







	We have a net loss of $1,068,703 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to a net loss of $263,853 for the same period ended March 31, 2012.     The significant increase in net losses is mainly related to a loss on debt extinguishment of $1,008,000 during the three month period ended March 31, 2013 as we settled certain debts with the issuance of shares of the Company with no comparable amount for the period ended March 31, 2012.   Interest expense increased as well to $5,645 for the period ended March 31, 2013 from $1,085 (March 31, 2012).







	Basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.01 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $0.00 for the three months ended March 31, 2012.








	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements









	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

	ITEM

	3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK









	The Company is a smaller reporting company and is not required to provide this information.






	 







	ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES








	We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of March 31, 2013.  This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our sole officer,  Jean Mann, who is also the sole director.   Based on her evaluation, she has concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the Evaluation Date as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	Disclosure controls and procedures are those controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Multi-Corp.’s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



	 



	As of March 31, 2013, Jean Mann assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.







	Material Weaknesses




	 




	Jean Mann has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of Evaluation Date and identified the following material weaknesses:







	1.           Certain entity level controls establishing a “tone at the top” were considered material weaknesses. As of March 31, 2013 we did not have an audit committee as the Company has one officer who is also the sole director.   No independent expert has been appointed to the audit committee so that it is not controlled by one individual as it is presently. There is no policy on fraud. A whistleblower policy cannot be established given the small size of the organization.







	2.           Jean Mann’s override of existing controls is possible given the small size of the organization and lack of personnel.




	 




	3.           There is no system in place to review and monitor internal control over financial reporting. The Company maintains an insufficient complement of personnel and outsources its accounting functions, therefore it does not have controls in place to carry out ongoing monitoring responsibilities and ensure effective internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	Notwithstanding the assessment that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective Jean Mann believes that the Company’s financial statements contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2013 fairly present its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in all material respects.




	 




	There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended March 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.






	 






	7










	 







	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls








	Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving our objectives and our sole officer and director concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that


	judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
