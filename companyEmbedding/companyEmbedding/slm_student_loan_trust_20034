For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

THE TRUST
STUDENT LOAN POOL

 

The trust
student loans owned by the trust were originally selected from a
portfolio of consolidation student loans owned by the Student Loan
Marketing Association by employing several criteria, including
requirements that each trust student loan as of the original cutoff
date:

 




 



·



 



was
guaranteed as to principal and interest by a guaranty agency under
a guarantee agreement and the guaranty agency was, in turn,
reinsured by the Department of Education in accordance with the
FFELP;




 




 



·



 



contained terms
in accordance with those required by the FFELP, the guarantee
agreements and other applicable requirements;




 




 



·



 



was
more than 120 days past the final disbursement;




 




 



·



 



was
not more than 210 days past due;




 




 



·



 



did
not have a borrower who was noted in the related records of the
servicer as being currently involved in a bankruptcy proceeding;
and




 




 



·



 



had
special allowance payments, if any, based on the three-month
commercial paper rate or the 91-day Treasury bill rate.




 

No
trust student loan as of the original cutoff date was subject to
the depositor’s or the Student Loan Marketing
Association’s prior obligation to sell that loan to a third
party. The Student Loan Marketing Association was dissolved on
December 31, 2004 and all of its obligations were assumed by
its affiliate, SLM Education Credit Finance Corporation.

 

Unless
otherwise specified, all information with respect to the trust
student loans is presented as of May 1, 2010, which is the
statistical disclosure date.

 

The
distribution by weighted average interest rate applicable to the
trust student loans on any date following the statistical
disclosure date may vary significantly from that in the following
tables as a result of variations in the effective rates of interest
applicable to the trust student loans and in rates of principal
reduction. Moreover, the information below about the weighted
average remaining term to maturity of the trust student loans as of
the statistical disclosure date may vary significantly from the
actual term to maturity of any of the trust student loans as a
result of prepayments or the granting of deferment and forbearance
periods.

 

The following
tables provide a description of specified characteristics of the
trust student loans as of the statistical disclosure date. The
aggregate outstanding principal balance of the loans in each of the
following tables includes the principal balance due from borrowers,
plus accrued interest of $4,451,030 to be capitalized as of the
statistical disclosure date. Percentages and dollar amounts in any
table may not total 100% or whole dollars due to rounding. The
following tables also contain information concerning the total
number of loans and total number of borrowers in the portfolio
of

 

A-1


 


 


trust student
loans. For ease of administration, the servicer separates a
consolidation loan on its system into two separate loan segments
representing subsidized and unsubsidized segments of the same loan.
The following tables reflect those loan segments within the number
of loans. In addition, approximately 8 borrowers have more than one
trust student loan.

We
determined the weighted average remaining term to maturity shown in
the table from the statistical disclosure date to the stated
maturity date of the applicable trust student loan without giving
effect to any deferment or forbearance periods that may be granted
in the future. See Appendix A to the preliminary remarketing
memorandum.

 

The weighted
average annual borrower interest rate shown in the table is
exclusive of special allowance payments. The weighted average
spread for special allowance payments to the 91-day Treasury bill
rate was 3.10% as of the statistical disclosure date.

 

The weighted
average spread for special allowance payments to the three-month
commercial paper rate was 2.64% as of the statistical disclosure
date. See “Special Allowance Payments” in
Appendix A to the preliminary remarketing memorandum.

 

For this
purpose, the three-month commercial paper rate is the average of
the bond equivalent rates of the three-month commercial paper
(financial) rates in effect for each of the days in a calendar
quarter as reported by the Federal Reserve in Publication H.15 (or
its successor) for that calendar quarter. The 91-day Treasury bill
rate is the weighted average per annum discount rate, expressed on
a bond equivalent basis and applied on a daily basis, for direct
obligations of the United States with a maturity of thirteen weeks,
as reported by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

 

A-2


 


 


The
category “Treasury Bill—Other” in the table above
represents the Health Education Assistance Loan Program (which we
refer to as “HEAL” and the loans originated under such
program as “HEAL Loans”) portion of any consolidation
loans made under the FFELP which consolidated one or more Stafford
Loans, SLS Loans and/or PLUS Loans with one or more student loans
originated under the HEAL Program. These consolidation loans are
guaranteed as to principal and interest by a guaranty agency and
reinsured by the Department of Education. The HEAL portion of any
consolidation loan is not eligible to receive special allowance
payments or interest subsidy payments. The interest rate on the
HEAL Loan segment of any such consolidation loan is variable and is
reset each July 1, based upon the average bond-equivalent rate
for 91-day Treasury bills auctioned during the three months ending
June 30, plus 3.0%. In addition, the applicable interest rate on
the HEAL Loan segment of any such consolidation loan is not subject
to any cap on the interest 
 rate.

We
determined the interest rates shown in the table above using the
interest rates applicable to the trust student loans as of the
statistical disclosure date. Because trust student loans with
different interest rates are likely to be repaid at different
rates, this information is not likely to remain applicable to the
trust student loans after the statistical disclosure date. See
Appendix A to the preliminary remarketing memorandum and
“The Student Loan Pools—Sallie Mae’s Student
Loan Financing Business” in the original
prospectus.

Fitch Affirms SLM 2003-4 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms SLM 2003-4
    





November 18, 2016 04:35 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions on SLM Student Loan 
      Trust 2003-4:
    

      --Class A-5A affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5B affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5C affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5D affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5E affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'Asf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      U.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral comprises Federal Family 
      Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans with guaranties provided by 
      eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of 
      Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. 
      Fitch's U.S. sovereign rating is currently 'AAA'/Outlook Stable.
    

      Collateral Performance: Fitch assumes a base case default rate of 12.5% 
      and a 37.5% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress scenario. The 
      claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% for the base case and 3.0% for 
      the 'AAAsf' case. Fitch applies the standard default timing curve in its 
      credit stress cash flow analysis. The trailing-12-month (TTM) average 
      constant default rate, used in the maturity stresses, is 2.4%. TTM 
      levels of deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment (before 
      adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary and involuntary) are 
      5.2%, 8.7%, 14.7% and 9.2% respectively, and are used as the starting 
      point in cash flow modeling. Subsequent declines or increases are 
      modeled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed to be 
      approximately 0.16% based on information provided by the sponsor.
    

      Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and 
      interest rate stresses to this transaction as per criteria.
    

      Payment Structure: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by 
      overcollateralization, excess spread and, for the class A notes, 
      subordination. As of September 2016, total and senior effective parity 
      ratios (which include the reserve account) are, respectively, 100.49% 
      (0.49% CE) and 105.44% (5.16% CE). Liquidity support is provided by a 
      reserve account sized at the greater of 0.25% of the pool balance, and 
      $3,384,496, currently equal to $3,384,496. Excess cash will continue to 
      be released as long as 100% parity is maintained.
    

      Maturity Risk: Fitch's Student Loan ABS (SLABS) cash flow model 
      indicates that the notes are paid in full on or prior to the legal final 
      maturity dates under the commensurate rating scenario.
    

      Operational Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by Navient 
      Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Sallie Mae, Inc.). Fitch believes 
      Navient to be an acceptable servicer of FFELP student loans.
    

      CRITERIA APPLICATION
    

      Under the 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds', dated September 1, 2016, Fitch looks to its own ratings in 
      analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's 
      creditworthiness. The definition of permitted investments for this deal 
      allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by Fitch, 
      which represents a criteria variation. Since the only available funds to 
      invest are those held in the Collection Account, and the funds can only 
      be invested for a short duration given the payment frequency of the 
      notes, Fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact 
      upon the ratings assigned.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      'AAAsf' rated tranches of most FFELP securitizations will likely move in 
      tandem with the U.S. sovereign rating, given the strong linkage to the 
      U.S. sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and SAP provided by ED. 
      Sovereign risks are not addressed in Fitch's sensitivity analysis.
    

      Fitch conducted a CE sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related 
      lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions. In addition, Fitch 
      conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different 
      assumptions for the IBR usage and prepayment rate. The results below 
      should only be considered as one potential model implied outcome as the 
      transaction is exposed to multiple risk factors that are all dynamic 
      variables.
    

      Credit Stress Rating Sensitivity
    

      --Default increase 25%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      --Default increase 50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      --Basis Spread increase 0.25%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      --Basis Spread increase 0.50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      Maturity Stress Rating Sensitivity
    

      --CPR decrease 50%: class A 'Asf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      --CPR increase 100%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAAsf'
    

      --IBR Usage increase 100%: class A 'Asf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      --IBR Usage decrease 50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAAsf'
    

      Stresses are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity 
      of the notes to unexpected deterioration in trust performance. Rating 
      sensitivity should not be used as an indicator of future rating 
      performance.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
