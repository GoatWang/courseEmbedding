Full Text:

            It's been nearly 15 years since I graduated from medical
school, young and enthusiastic about an industry in which some of the
brightest, intuitive and hardworking individuals made their careers. I
subsequently returned to business school, with the hope of applying some
business acumen to health care, and with the vision to help lead a
flourishing industry.Now that I have worked in the health care delivery industry for
many years--viewing it through both a clinical and business lens--I have
been consistently surprised with a single notion: the health care
delivery industry does not function as a service industry at all. In
fact, in many respects, health care has not applied many principles that
other industries, service or otherwise, have used to improve their
performance.Tunnel vision on qualityHistorically, health care organizations relied on traditions of
quality performance as their primary differentiating strategy in the
marketplace. At large conferences comprised of physicians from numerous
organizations, when asked what differentiates their organization from
others, the routine response is "our organization is of higher
quality than all others."What the health care delivery industry has yet to see is that
clinical quality alone is not a sufficient differentiator. Despite the
fact that our society is changing to one of enhanced consumerism,
intolerance for poor service and impatience, many organizations continue
to fall back on "quality" as their distinguishing feature.



As a result of health care's historical lack of focus on the
service elements of its operations, health care delivery is in fact a
service industry that doesn't act like one. When you consider the
impeccable service offered by the Ritz Carlton, by Southwest Airlines or
by premium restaurants here in Massachusetts and elsewhere, the
immaturity of health care is readily apparent by the real-time
experiences patients suffer every day:* Waiting six hours to be seen in emergency rooms* Waiting nine months to schedule a physical with a primary care
physician, even though a patient may have barely utilized any services
that year* Playing phone tag incessantly with the doctor's office to
try to get through to schedule an appointment or seek advice* Waiting in queue in waiting rooms, then in exam rooms and then
again in the lab or pharmacy requiring patients to take a whole day off
from work just to spend 15-20 minutes with the doctor* Receiving test results weeks after they are complete, or never at
all* Being treated by health care staff as if you are one on a long
list to be seen that day, rather than recognized as a customer to be
treated with utmost courtesy, respect and admirationThe need for changeWhen Fallon Clinic in Worcester, Mass., conducted market research
and focus groups with health care consumers and asked patients what they
wanted from their health care providers, the respondents rarely
mentioned quality.[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]Instead, nearly 100 percent of all focus group participants
highlighted improved customer service as the key opportunity for
improvement among most providers. When specifically asked about omission
of a focus on quality, patients responded by saying: "Doctors have
gone to medical school. That requires hard work and dedication. We
presume most doctors will offer high quality care."This is not an unexpected response when you consider that quality
is also assumed in other service industries. For example, is a
traveler's concern about arriving, safely at a destination the
major factor in a choice between US Airways, Southwest Airlines or
American Airlines?It is clear from a service perspective that health care is in great
need of transformation. As physicians and leaders of the health care
industry, we have been remiss in supplementing excellence in clinical
quality with what consumers want: service quality. To put it another
way, patients expect that doctors will care for them, but they want
doctors and their staff to care about them.Some physician groups have recognized that service orientation is
important to patients, and is an essential element of success. One
notable example is the emergence of concierge practices, groups that
offer same-day access for appointments, 24-hour on-call coverage for
emergencies, inviting environments and house calls, all for a
supplemental fee to doctors for providing these services. The creation
of such practices implies that good service in health care must come at
a price. This is definitely not so.Beyond the notion of service orientation, health care must
transform in other ways, applying the business principles and techniques
long proven and used by other non-health care companies.For example, many physicians do not use or plan to use modern
technologies, such as electronic medical records. That's surprising
when you consider the EMRs improve efficiency, communication and safety.
Likewise, many of the delays and service problems in health care can be
addressed and fixed through sophisticated process redesign. Most other
industries have done it, why not health care?Fallon Clinic's transformationFallon Clinic embarked on a path of transformation to right some of
these service deficiencies, namely to transition our practice into a
"gold standard" of health care delivery. Although steeped in a
rich quality tradition and nationally recognized for excellence in
clinical quality, our organization realized that a tunnel vision focus
on quality is not sufficient to achieve the gold standard.Employees at Fallon Clinic scrutinized every element of its
operational procedure and contractual relationships, and embarked on a
strategic transformation. Some of the key elements include:Accepting multiple insurersFor 25 years, Fallon Clinic was nearly exclusive with Fallon
Community Health Plan (FCHP), with the exceptions of some contracts with
indemnity insurers, preferred provider organization (PPO) networks and
CIGNA Healthcare. Fallon Clinic and FCHP are strong partners; however,
this exclusivity limited patient satisfaction for both organizations.At the clinic, this led to discontinuity of care, where patients
were forced to break physician relationships as a result of insurance
changes through their employer. Given the patient and physician
dissatisfaction associated with these broken relationships, Fallon
entered the first phase of the group's strategic transformation by
accepting multiple insurers.Fallon physicians now see patients with multiple forms of insurance
including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care, FCHP, CIGNA, Private Health Care Systems and others.Fallon Clinic received strong feedback from patients that
contracting with other insurers was long overdue. Over the course of a
four-month period, nearly 3,800 Blue Cross Blue Shield patients joined
Fallon Clinic, either as first-time patients or as patients returning to
their former physicians.Focus on serviceWhat patients wanted most from their doctors was to be treated as a
customer, i.e. to be listened to, respected and treated as they would be
treated at good hotels or restaurants. With an understanding that the
patient comes first, Fallon began:* Asking our patients what they want: Fallon revised its patient
satisfaction survey process and is now sending out weekly surveys to its
patients to understand where the organization can make improvements.* A customer advisory board was also formed, comprised of health
care consumers who will help direct the practice toward those areas in
greatest need of change.* Fallon Clinic is in the process of implementing a training
program that mirrors those conducted at Disney and the Ritz Carlton.* Fallon is recruiting high-quality doctors and staff who are
extremely service oriented.Process re-engineeringThrough its focus groups, Fallon learned that correcting
appointment delays and telephone delays ran a close second when patients
were asked what they wanted from health care. The common misperception
among patients is that physician offices are unable to improve access to
care because of inadequate staff or too many patients.Alternatively, I would propose that the primary reasons for
inability to improve access are process inefficiencies. A business
leader could spend years reviewing thousands of cases of companies that
improved throughput and access delays by re-engineering processes. Even
the leaders of the Ritz Carlton attest that process improvements are the
key to their success.Fallon is working to re-engineer several processes to reduce wait
time, answer phone calls quickly with hold times of less than 60
seconds, and develop a simplified scheduling process that includes
treating some basic illnesses at home. Many Fallon Clinic primary care
physicians can now see patients for routine physicals within 14 days,
some even the same day.Use of modern technologyGiven the use of technology in most other industries, the
over-whelming absence of such technologies in health care delivery is
remarkable. Fallon Clinic recognizes that the use of cutting-edge
technology is critical to process improvement, service enhancement and
patient safety.Over the next two years, the organization will invest in the
following technologies:* Upgraded electronic medical records* Full scale telephone system and voicemail upgrades* Voice recognition transcription and switchboard services* Film-less digital radiology allowing instantaneous X-ray image
transmission to distant sites* Web enhancement including "Web visits" for patients who
prefer to communicate with their MDs over the Internet instead of
through personal visits or the telephoneFallon's goal is to be on the leading edge of both patient
care and customer service.RELATED ARTICLEImagine a world where: You awake in the morning, realize you want a
physical exam, log on to the Internet and book your appointment, online,
with your doctor, for later that same day. You arrive at your
doctor's office and it is warm and inviting, and all staff greet
you as you would be greeted when arriving at the best hotels.[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]You wait in a waiting room that is as comfortable and inviting as
your living room, has recent magazines. Your total visit to the
doctor's office is less than one hour, of which more half of the
time is spent with practitioners. Your doctor's office staff uses
modern technology and when you leave the practice and arrive at your
pharmacy, your prescription is filled and waiting for you.By Craig E. Samitt, MD, MBACraig Samitt is chief operating officer at Fallon Clinic in

Interview with Craig Samitt, MD
June 1, 2017 by TLD Group Craig Samitt, MD, MBA is the EVP and Chief Clinical Officer at Anthem, where he is responsible for establishing, leading, and executing overall clinical vision and strategy for Anthem, the second largest health insurer in the US. In this role, Craig leads all clinical operations and policy as well as Anthem’s diversification strategy, from payer as a benefit-management company to payer as partner, enabler, and convener. An internal medicine physician by training, Craig has worked across multiple sectors within the health ecosystem including providers, payers, and policy makers. His work specializes in turnaround management, growth of physician networks, enhancing integrated delivery systems, and diversifying health plans in competitive markets.
Key take-aways:

All the players in the health ecosystem have done what they can within their world, but the industry now needs a new model that coordinates across the various players.
Collaboration requires an understanding of each stakeholders’ expertise and capabilities to maximize the strength of the partnership.
The health ecosystem requires engagement of non-traditional players to address the social determinants of care by influencing “upstream” stakeholders.

TLD Group: What is Anthem’s role in the health ecosystem?
Samitt: I would define our role in the health ecosystem as immersed and evolving. Immersed because of how interconnected we are with many of the key players in the ecosystem, specifically members, health plans, patients, employers, providers, other payers (e.g. the government), and vendors that are innovating and creating new solutions to impact the health of the communities served by our health plan affiliates. Our role in connecting these various players, positions us to help the collective ecosystem design innovative solutions and move forward. Evolving because I believe organizations, like Anthem, have not yet capitalized on their immersion in the ecosystem to drive significant and necessary change. Payers have historically functioned in the realm of benefits management, yet there’s a great opportunity for payers to play a more significant role – e.g. payer as analytics company, retail company, navigator, facilitator, convener, enabler, and other positions that leverage its ability to drive change.
TLD Group: What is the imperative for payers to change their business model and adopt a new way of doing things?
Samitt: All players in the ecosystem share the goal of providing higher quality, more accessible, more affordable care to the people we serve. Everyone talks about that as an aspiration, but there are very few organizations that have executed upon it, because execution of the Triple Aim to some extent requires reinvention of each of the players. It feels that all the distinct players in the ecosystem have done what they can do within their world to drive industry change. Payers have used their historical benefits management tools to maximize quality and reduce costs. Providers have sought to improve quality and value, but with limited access to capital and tools to help move to the next level. Unless we begin to see partnerships with shared accountability and coordination of functions across the various players, we’re not going to advance to the next level. It’s time for a new model. Secondly, things have gotten very complex, and there is an absence of an entity that has “stepped up” to bring order out of chaos. As things become more complex, there’s a greater need for order. I think now is the time for us to step forward with a new set of solutions.
TLD Group: How has Anthem succeeded in changing its business model?
Samitt: One of our many growing payer/provider relationships is Vivity, which is a product offered by our California health plan in partnership with seven of the largest and most successful health systems in Southern California. The collaborators recognized that a delivery system that is exceptional in achieving high-quality outcomes could partner with a payer that is interested in quality, cost, and service, and bring their expertise together to work in alignment for the benefit of the patients and the members. The team that’s leading this partnership, newly-founded within Anthem, developed new approaches to effectively support both the payer and the providers. For example, the analytics that support population health needed to be provider-user-friendly and provider-workflow-embedded. As opposed to a claims-oriented system, we needed a system that merged claims and clinical data into an existing platform that various providers could use. We evolved our analytics approach and the systems that providers use to blend clinical and claims information into a usable format. As another example, payers have historically used telephonic case management as their approach to manage complex patients, but in the provider world you really want practice-embedded case management that’s co-located with the caregivers. We’ve got a team of provider-enablement clinicians that position themselves within hospitals and within practices, to work directly with the caregivers as opposed to working virtually. We’re early into this partnership, but are beginning to see great results, including the evolution of quality outcomes, safety improvement, and cost reduction that show significant progress from the collective organization’s prior performance.
TLD Group: How do you engage other organizations to work with Anthem to drive collaborative solutions?
Samitt: The need for payer/provider collaborations and provider-enablement stemmed from Anthem’s progress toward value-based payments. We were one of the first payers to aggressively pursue transition from fee-for-service to value-based payment and ACOs. We realized that we would not be able to drive value if we did not play a more substantive role in assuring that providers knew how to reinvent themselves in a value-based world. One of the reasons why managed care failed in the past was that payers did not play a central role, and in some instances neither the payer nor the provider had the effective tools to thrive under value-based arrangements. Our desire was to avoid repeating the past by developing a set of capabilities that supported providers as they entered into value-based arrangements with Anthem, specifically the embedding of care management and practice transformation supports within the practice. Our goal was to offer providers the tools and services that we know work in the industry and embed them in their practice resources to help assure their success.
Anthem’s toolkit of resources and services includes about 12 transformational dimensions. Not every provider is in the same place in terms of capabilities. The discussions often start out with both sides comparing and contrasting their capabilities and services to inform decisions. Oftentimes, the provider and payer want to retain ownership of the capabilities they do well. By comparing the strengths and weaknesses on these 12 dimensions, we can determine which areas each excels at, and negotiate through the gray areas. Negotiating in this way helps overcome “turf wars” in which each want to retain ownership of everything they’ve done, rather than trusting that the other has better expertise or resources to do a better job.
However, not every health system is at the same level of receptivity to redesign a practice. There are many organizations that have not bought into value-based transformation, and they are very likely to turn down our services. That said, there’s great receptivity by others that are more advanced in their thinking and understand that value-based transformation is inevitable. Anthem doesn’t need every provider in our market to pursue value, but rather just a significant provider who is willing to take a leap of faith and collaborate to build something new together. We just need a frontrunner in every market to set the pace, who will likely then drive change in the whole market.
TLD Group: What is your perspective on engaging non-traditional collaborations in Anthem’s health ecosystem?
Samitt: Social determinants of health are the greatest driver of healthcare costs. I believe that the industry needs to be reinvented to develop “upstream thinking,” which is the prevention of sickness, illness, accidents, and other health issues by influencing patients and their network of relationships to be accountable for their own health. The question becomes, how do we influence the “upstream” stakeholders (i.e. points of prevention) to control health so that we don’t have to rely on the “downstream” stakeholders (e.g. hospitals, doctors, etc.) to treat sickness? We, as healthcare organizations, need to invest a portion of our time and energy educating families, employers, and communities, to all play a role in influencing sickness prevention and health awareness by providing them with the tools, resources, and incentives to manage health. We need to find a way to get consumers to be accountable for their own health, and find a way to support providers to focus on more value-based rather than volume-based approaches to care. We can collaborate with public health and community organizations to influence social determinants. The difficulties in forging these relationships are 1) the financing divide that exists between public health and medical health, and 2) the ability to deploy payer resources from the health sector to the social sector. I’m not sure we’ve developed the right approach to bridging that divide, but organizations like Anthem are well-positioned to work with the public sector to figure that out. Right now, we’re early on in having those conversations and are trying to understand how we can connect our two worlds. I believe that’s where we’ll start to see more innovation.

Samitt to leave DaVita

  By Bob Herman
         | July 18, 2014
      


Dr. Craig Samitt, CEO of HealthCare Partners, the Torrance, Calif.-based division of DaVita HealthCare Partners, will step down on Aug. 1. DaVita CEO Kent Thiry will assume responsibility for the division, the company said. Officials did not say why Samitt was resigning. He started with HealthCare Partners in August 2013 as executive vice president before being named CEO this past March. Dialysis giant DaVita acquired HealthCare Partners in 2012.The HealthCare Partners deal was a key part of DaVita's strategy to transform itself into a company capable of providing and coordinating a broader continuum of care. It has struggled, however, to produce encouraging financial results with the division.“I will miss working with the talented physicians, staff and management that created and will sustain the HealthCare Partners legacy," Samitt said in a statement. “The company is well-positioned to continue to transform population health in the United States.”Samitt also serves as a member of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, with his term ending in April 2015.Before joining DaVita, Samitt was CEO of Madison, Wis.-based Dean Health Systems, which was acquired last year by Roman Catholic system SSM Health Care.
