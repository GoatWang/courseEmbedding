Tracey, along with a group of highly–qualified independent contractors she has hand chosen based on their specific areas of expertise, is what makes M3G Inc. the most comprehensive one–stop–shop for all sales and marketing needs.  
									



The M3G Team


TRACEY MASON, PRESIDENT AND CREATIVE DIRECTOR


									Tracey Mason is a 25–year veteran of the adult beverage industry with experience in nearly every facet. She has held executive–level marketing positions at some of the world's largest beverage companies, including Diageo, where she worked her way up from sales management to Director of Commercial Innovation, and Fosters Wine Estates, where she held the position of Vice President of Marketing/Innovation until 2006, when she left to pursue her dream of running a small business. 
									

									As Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Epic Wines, a mid–sized, California–based distributor of fine wines, Tracey honed her leadership and financial management skills while leading the company toward extraordinary growth. She left Epic in 2008 to take an equity position at ProVina Inc, a Silicon Valley start–up focused on technology–based innovation in winemaking, and began consulting to a number of established and start–up companies, including Golden Star Tea and Clos de la Tech Winery. 									

									In 2010, Tracey was drawn back into the corporate world to take the role of Executive Vice President of Global Marketing at Goelet Wines Estates &lpar;GWE&rpar;.  There, she championed the repositioning and renaissance of the iconic Clos Du Val Winery, solidifying her position as a brand renovation specialist.
									
Tracey left GWE in April 2013 and launched M3G, Inc.  Today, M3G is leading brand marketing, PR, innovation and renovation projects for some of Northern California's most renowned companies, including Valley of the Moon Winery, Silverado Vineyards, ZIATA Wines and others. 


									"I approach everything I do with enthusiasm. I love my job, and take pride in the fact that I know I am good at what I do. If I had to choose three words that best define my own "core essence," they would likely be passion, intelligence and truth, with a healthy dose of fun thrown in the mix. There are boundless opportunities for brands to differentiate themselves from the pack. I can help you get there — and we can have fun doing it&excl;"

									Kelly Keagy is a seasoned wine public relations professional with a career spanning two decades. She brings to her clients an extraordinary level of media relationships, encompassing wine, food, business and travel editors.

TRACI SEVILLE, GRAPHIC DESIGN, PRINT MEDIA AND PROMOTION


									Traci launched her career in the tasting room of Clos Du Val Winery in 1997. Her keen eye for detail and design quickly propelled her into Clos Du Val's marketing department, where she is currently Creative Director.
									

									Ever the entrepreneur, in 2002 Traci launched her own company, TraciLane Design, where she works with some of Napa Valley's most prestigious brands, including David Arthur, Elyse and Grgich Hills, and through which she launched and manages her own wine brand, Jake Ryan Cellars. Traci joined M3G as a board member and freelance designer in 2013. With a passion for digital design, photography and even jewelry, Traci's passionate approach to creative design combined with her love of Napa Valley is what makes her a key member of the M3G design team.

Customer Testimonials



"Tracey is a highly qualified marketer capable of truly understanding the needs of her clients and quickly establishing a plan of action. She is excessively timely on deliverables and helps me do the same."
									






 									— Linda LaPonza, Creator and Owner, LaPonza Wines

				




"Tracey has a rare and potent combination of Strategy, Sales, and Marketing acumen steeped in financial savvy and street smarts. I've met very few people who are as talented, bright, passionate, and hard–working as Tracey. Whether creating a high–level strategy or rolling up her sleeves to knock off mundane tasks, Tracey approaches every project with a phenomenal level of professionalism, engagement and gusto. What's more, she does so without pretense or asserting her well–earned rank in the business. And that's the hallmark of true character."
									






 									— Carol Reber, CMO, Duckhorn Vineyards 
										 
				




"Tracey Mason is clearly one of the smartest strategic marketing professionals I have worked with in my career. She understands new product innovation beyond getting it to market. Tracey knows that it's all about consumers' needs. She knows how to inspire teams so that the best and the most creative and strategic thinking is applied. Not only is she a great leader of teams, she works hard and brings the best new products and strategies to market. Clearly, Tracey is one of the best."
									






 									— Elwanda Edwards, Former General Manager/Partner, Tracy Locke 
										 
				




"Tracey is awesome&excl; She provided brilliant clarity and vision to our marketing strategy and she got us the excellent contacts into the industry that we needed. Before she came to the company, we had a scattered shotgun approach to the market. Within two months of coming on board, Tracey had a strategy that was clear and focused. The size of the prize was easily explainable to our board of directors, and we were executing with laser focus."
									






 									— Mark Holst, Former VP of Operations, ProVina, Inc

RECENT NEWS UPDATES





Quality Certification


On Friday November 18th, M3 Technology received its updated Certificate of Registration to the AS 9120 and ISO 9001 Standards.  This Certification followed an October audit of M3′s Quality Management System by SAI Global with no non-conformances for the second straight year.  This certification represents M3 Technology’s on-going commitment to quality and its dedication to continual improvement.  This audit also marked the first under the direction of M3 Technology’s new quality leadership team, led by Quality Manager Tom McNinney.
While the audit identified no non-conforming conditions, M3′s Quality group worked closely with the auditor to find several opportunities for improvement which will be integrated within the Quality Management System over the next several weeks.  The SAI audit followed closely on the heals of several customer site visits, all of which served to further develop and verify M3 Technology’s Quality Management system and processes.
For more information regarding M3 Technology, a copy of the new certificate, or questions regarding M3 Technology’s Quality Department, visit www.m3-tec.com/quality or email us at quality@m3-tec.com.

M3 Racing take the Checkered Flag at Thompson


From NASCAR.com
 
THOMPSON, Conn. – After saying he ‘gave’ away about thirty points this season with two DNF’s, Justin Bonsignore was finally able to celebrate after a race Wednesday at Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park.
Bonsignore passed points leader Doug Coby on Lap 74 and withheld a strong challenge for the lead on a restart with fours lap remaining to win the Budweiser King of Beers 150 for his first win of the season.
Bonsignore qualified third and was able to muscle by Coby for the lead and hold off the two-time defending NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour champion for his ninth career win and fourth overall at Thompson.
The third and final caution of the race was given to the field on Lap 143 for a single car spin setting up the final restart. Bonsignore was able to drive away with Coby in tow to get his first win since the Holtsville, N.Y. native won at Riverhead Raceway last season.
Bobby Santos finished third as Woody Pitkat and Ryan Preece rounded out the top five. Max Zachem was sixth with Ron Silk, Donny Lia, Shawn Solomito and Jeff Goodale coming home seventh through 10th, respectively.
Chase Dowling took advantage of a quick pit stop by his crew during the first caution of the race on Lap 58 to take the lead where he stayed until Coby got by on Lap 62 on the restart.
Bonsignore was able to pull to within 15 points of the lead and now trails Coby 397-382 in the standings with seven races remaining. Timmy Solomito is third with Donny Lia and Jimmy Blewett rounding out the top five in the standings.
The Budweiser King of Beers 150 will be televised on NBCSN on Friday, Aug. 26, 8 p.m. ET.
The NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour returns to action along with its NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour counterparts for their annual combination race on Wednesday, Aug. 17 at Bristol Motor Speedway.
The Bush’s Beans 150 will be held at 6 p.m. as part of a doubleheader with the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.
