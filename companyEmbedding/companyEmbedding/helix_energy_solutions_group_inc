History[edit]
Timeline[edit]
1980 – Oceaneering executives, Lad Handleman, John Swinden, Don Sites and Rick Foreman left the company and named their new company Cal Dive International. Oceaneering was formed in 1964 when Handelman merged his California oilfield diving company, Cal Dive, with Canadian-based Can-Dive and upon his departure Handleman reclaimed his original company name for the new venture.[3]
1983 – Cal Dive Intl. was acquired by Diversified Energy International (DEI) whose financial backing allowed the company to expand with two converted diving vessels.
1985 –Handleman suffered a severe injury in a skiing accident and as a result was paralyzed from the waist down. Jim Nelson would take over the company and Handleman served as a consultant with the company for five more years.[4]
1990 – Led by new CEO Jerry Reuhl, a management team that included future-CEO Owen Kratz, purchased Cal Dive Intl. from DEI for $11 million with Merrill Lynch acting as the financial partner, providing all of the holding a 45% equity position.[5]
1992 – After establishing a business model of acquiring offshore oil and gas properties near the end of their production life in the Gulf of Mexico, Cal Dive Intl. created a subsidiary called Energy Resource Technology (ERT) to manage its growing portfolio of Gulf shelf properties.
1993 Cal Dive Intl. management bought Merrill Lynch out in 1993, and then sold 50% of the company to First Reserve Corporation in 1995, to raise more capital to support a growing deepwater program.
1994 – Cal Dive Intl. acquires its first Dynamically Positioned vessel, the Witch Queen which allowed the company to enter the deepwater market in the Gulf of Mexico for the first time.
1996 – Cal Dive Intl. acquires the Uncle John semi-submersible drilling rig and extends the company’s well intervention capabilities. Cal Dive Intl. also purchased offshore energy company Aquaitica Inc. which was the company’s first corporate acquisition and added four shallow water diving support vessels to its fleet.
1997 –Kratz succeeds Reuhl as CEO. Kratz had previously served as the COO and Executive Vice President. Kratz was an accomplished oilfield diver who had previously owned his own marine construction company. Shortly after his ascension, Cal Dive Intl. became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
2001 – Cal Dive Intl. purchases Professional Divers of New Orleans for $11.5 million and acquired 85 percent of outstanding Canyon Offshore shares, and purchased the remaining 15 percent over the next three years. With the acquisition of Canyon Offshore, Cal Dive Intl. could now offer operators ROV, intervention and cable/flowline burial services.[6]
2002 – The world’s first deepsea well intervention semi-submersible, the Q4000, is launched into service in the Gulf of Mexico.[7]
2006 – Following the acquisition of Helix RDS,[8] a reservoir consultancy company, Cal Dive Intl. changed the corporate name to Helix Energy Solutions Group Inc.[9] to better reflect the company’s double-stranded business model of offering contracting services while also maintaining a role as an independent oil and gas producer. The company also moved its stock listing from NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol, HLX.
2008 – Newbuild well intervention vessel, Well Enhancer, is launched into service in the North Sea.[10]
2010 – Helix ESG deploys multiple assets and resources to contain the 2010 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill.[11]
2012 – Helix ESG announces divestiture plans regarding its subsea construction business unit,[12] Helix Subsea Construction, and the sale of its vessels. Helix ESG also announced that going forward well intervention and ROV services would be its primary contracting businesses and new vessels would be purchased or chartered to meet growing demand in those service sectors.
2015 – Helix Energy Solutions Group saw its profit tumble 78 percent in the fourth quarter as upstreams curb drilling activity.[13]
The Company[edit]
Helix ESG is divided into four business units:
Helix Well Ops[edit]
Provider of a range of well operation, subsea wireline and decommissioning services with specialist vessels and in-house developed equipment that includes the Subsea Intervention Lubricator and the Intervention Riser System. Well Ops’ assets include three purpose-built offshore units along with mobile equipment. As of 2012, at least three more intervention vessels were scheduled to be added to Well Ops fleet starting in 2013.[14] Current assets include:

Q4000
MSV Seawell
MSV Well Enhancer
Intervention Riser System (IRS), a tool used in subsea well intervention and subsea well containment. The IRS enables access to subsea well trees while isolating the wellbore pressure as downhole tools like wireline or coiled tubing are deployed or changed out. The IRS is rated to operate up to 10,000 ft of water and capable of a maximum working pressure of 10,000 psi. It is also a component of the Helix Fast Response System as an emergency intervention tool in the event of a subsea well incident in the Gulf of Mexico.
Subsea Intervention Lubricator (SIL), wireline or coiled tubing systems used in riserless and diverless subsea light well intervention in the offshore oil and gas industry. SILs allow access to a live subsea well without the requirement of a Blow Out Preventer stack or a marine riser. The deployment of a SIL from a dynamically positioned multi-service vessel (MSV) is significantly less expensive than using a traditional drilling rig for intervention operations. SILs are typically rated to operate between 300 ft and 10,000 ft of water and have maximum working pressures of 10,000 psi.

Canyon Offshore[edit]
A supplier of subsea intervention services that has been operating ROV support vessels and ROV trenching services globally since its inception in 1996. The company currently operates over 50 ROV and trenching systems including over 45 heavy work class systems and five trenching and cable trenching systems along with four support vessels. Canyon Offshore operates from three regions; Houston, Aberdeen and Singapore, to effectively service their international client base. Assets include:

Grand Canyon
Deep Cygnus
Olympic Triton
Olympic Canyon
Triton Work Class ROV Systems
UHD Work Class ROV Systems
I-Trencher
T1200 Trencher

Energy Resources Technology GOM, Inc.[edit]
Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. has sold its ERT business unit.
Production Facilities[edit]
Helix Production Facilities unit participates with offshore oil and gas producers through negotiated contracting, infrastructure ownership, and reservoir equity interests. Assets include:

Helix Producer I
Marco Polo
Independence Hub

Management[edit]
Owen Kratz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc.

Right time to invest? – Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. (HLX), Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN)

By Grady Hoffman -   July 25, 2017

Shares of Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. (NYSE:HLX) are on a recovery track as they have regained 22.61% since bottoming out at $4.82 on May. 31, 2017. Thanks to a rise of almost 3.5% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -32.99% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -50.21% from $11.87 , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 06, 2016, but are collecting gains at -25.47% for the past 12 months.
HLX Target Price Reaches $9.13
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. (HLX)’s shares projecting a $9.13 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. (HLX)’s Sales Declined?
 HLX’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -7% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 14.8% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -13.98%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin -13.8%, and the sector’s average is 79.87%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHN) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -55.03% since hitting a peak level of $9.49 on Aug. 24, 2016. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -0.7% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 3.39% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 35.56% higher from $3.15, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Apr. 24, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 4.91% for the past six months.
Analysts See Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2.48% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN) to grow. At recent closing price of $4.27, ACHN has a chance to add $2.48 or 58.08% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($6.75) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 1.8 looks like a buy. It has a 36-month beta of 1.95 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHN) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly 8.1%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 17.58%, annually.
Is ACHN Turning Profits into Returns?
 Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN)’s ROE is -15.61%, while industry’s is -9.29%. The average ROE for the sector stands at -7.95%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s ROA is -15.16%, while industry’s average is -5.27%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is -16.98. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

The Company[edit]
Helix ESG is divided into four business units:
Helix Well Ops[edit]
Provider of a range of well operation, subsea wireline and decommissioning services with specialist vessels and in-house developed equipment that includes the Subsea Intervention Lubricator and the Intervention Riser System. Well Ops’ assets include three purpose-built offshore units along with mobile equipment. As of 2012, at least three more intervention vessels were scheduled to be added to Well Ops fleet starting in 2013.[14] Current assets include:

Q4000
MSV Seawell
MSV Well Enhancer
Intervention Riser System (IRS), a tool used in subsea well intervention and subsea well containment. The IRS enables access to subsea well trees while isolating the wellbore pressure as downhole tools like wireline or coiled tubing are deployed or changed out. The IRS is rated to operate up to 10,000 ft of water and capable of a maximum working pressure of 10,000 psi. It is also a component of the Helix Fast Response System as an emergency intervention tool in the event of a subsea well incident in the Gulf of Mexico.
Subsea Intervention Lubricator (SIL), wireline or coiled tubing systems used in riserless and diverless subsea light well intervention in the offshore oil and gas industry.

1980 – Oceaneering executives, Lad Handleman, John Swinden, Don Sites and Rick Foreman left the company and named their new company Cal Dive International. Oceaneering was formed in 1964 when Handelman merged his California oilfield diving company, Cal Dive, with Canadian-based Can-Dive and upon his departure Handleman reclaimed his original company name for the new venture.[3]
1983 – Cal Dive Intl. was acquired by Diversified Energy International (DEI) whose financial backing allowed the company to expand with two converted diving vessels.
1985 –Handleman suffered a severe injury in a skiing accident and as a result was paralyzed from the waist down. Jim Nelson would take over the company and Handleman served as a consultant with the company for five more years.[4]
1990 – Led by new CEO Jerry Reuhl, a management team that included future-CEO Owen Kratz, purchased Cal Dive Intl. from DEI for $11 million with Merrill Lynch acting as the financial partner, providing all of the holding a 45% equity position.[5]
1992 – After establishing a business model of acquiring offshore oil and gas properties near the end of their production life in the Gulf of Mexico, Cal Dive Intl. created a subsidiary called Energy Resource Technology (ERT) to manage its growing portfolio of Gulf shelf properties.
1993 Cal Dive Intl. management bought Merrill Lynch out in 1993, and then sold 50% of the company to First Reserve Corporation in 1995, to raise more capital to support a growing deepwater program.
1994 – Cal Dive Intl. acquires its first Dynamically Positioned vessel, the Witch Queen which allowed the company to enter the deepwater market in the Gulf of Mexico for the first time.
1996 – Cal Dive Intl. acquires the Uncle John semi-submersible drilling rig and extends the company’s well intervention capabilities. Cal Dive Intl. also purchased offshore energy company Aquaitica Inc. which was the company’s first corporate acquisition and added four shallow water diving support vessels to its fleet.
1997 –Kratz succeeds Reuhl as CEO. Kratz had previously served as the COO and Executive Vice President. Kratz was an accomplished oilfield diver who had previously owned his own marine construction company. Shortly after his ascension, Cal Dive Intl. became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
2001 – Cal Dive Intl. purchases Professional Divers of New Orleans for $11.5 million and acquired 85 percent of outstanding Canyon Offshore shares, and purchased the remaining 15 percent over the next three years. With the acquisition of Canyon Offshore, Cal Dive Intl. could now offer operators ROV, intervention and cable/flowline burial services.[6]
2002 – The world’s first deepsea well intervention semi-submersible, the Q4000, is launched into service in the Gulf of Mexico.[7]
2006 – Following the acquisition of Helix RDS,[8] a reservoir consultancy company, Cal Dive Intl. changed the corporate name to Helix Energy Solutions Group Inc.[9] to better reflect the company’s double-stranded business model of offering contracting services while also maintaining a role as an independent oil and gas producer. The company also moved its stock listing from NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol, HLX.
2008 – Newbuild well intervention vessel, Well Enhancer, is launched into service in the North Sea.[10]
2010 – Helix ESG deploys multiple assets and resources to contain the 2010 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill.[11]
2012 – Helix ESG announces divestiture plans regarding its subsea construction business unit,[12] Helix Subsea Construction, and the sale of its vessels. Helix ESG also announced that going forward well intervention and ROV services would be its primary contracting businesses and new vessels would be purchased or chartered to meet growing demand in those service sectors.
2015 – Helix Energy Solutions Group saw its profit tumble 78 percent in the fourth quarter as upstreams curb drilling activity.[13]
The Company[edit]
Helix ESG is divided into four business units:
Helix Well Ops[edit]
Provider of a range of well operation, subsea wireline and decommissioning services with specialist vessels and in-house developed equipment that includes the Subsea Intervention Lubricator and the Intervention Riser System. Well Ops’ assets include three purpose-built offshore units along with mobile equipment. As of 2012, at least three more intervention vessels were scheduled to be added to Well Ops fleet starting in 2013.[14] Current assets include:

Q4000
MSV Seawell
MSV Well Enhancer
Intervention Riser System (IRS), a tool used in subsea well intervention and subsea well containment. The IRS enables access to subsea well trees while isolating the wellbore pressure as downhole tools like wireline or coiled tubing are deployed or changed out. The IRS is rated to operate up to 10,000 ft of water and capable of a maximum working pressure of 10,000 psi. It is also a component of the Helix Fast Response System as an emergency intervention tool in the event of a subsea well incident in the Gulf of Mexico.
Subsea Intervention Lubricator (SIL), wireline or coiled tubing systems used in riserless and diverless subsea light well intervention in the offshore oil and gas industry. SILs allow access to a live subsea well without the requirement of a Blow Out Preventer stack or a marine riser. The deployment of a SIL from a dynamically positioned multi-service vessel (MSV) is significantly less expensive than using a traditional drilling rig for intervention operations. SILs are typically rated to operate between 300 ft and 10,000 ft of water and have maximum working pressures of 10,000 psi.

Canyon Offshore[edit]
A supplier of subsea intervention services that has been operating ROV support vessels and ROV trenching services globally since its inception in 1996. The company currently operates over 50 ROV and trenching systems including over 45 heavy work class systems and five trenching and cable trenching systems along with four support vessels. Canyon Offshore operates from three regions; Houston, Aberdeen and Singapore, to effectively service their international client base. Assets include:

Grand Canyon
Deep Cygnus
Olympic Triton
Olympic Canyon
Triton Work Class ROV Systems
UHD Work Class ROV Systems
I-Trencher
T1200 Trencher

Energy Resources Technology GOM, Inc.[edit]
Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. has sold its ERT business unit.
Production Facilities[edit]
Helix Production Facilities unit participates with offshore oil and gas producers through negotiated contracting, infrastructure ownership, and reservoir equity interests. Assets include:

Helix Producer I
Marco Polo
Independence Hub

Management[edit]
Owen Kratz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc.

History[edit]
Timeline[edit]
1980 – Oceaneering executives, Lad Handleman, John Swinden, Don Sites and Rick Foreman left the company and named their new company Cal Dive International. Oceaneering was formed in 1964 when Handelman merged his California oilfield diving company, Cal Dive, with Canadian-based Can-Dive and upon his departure Handleman reclaimed his original company name for the new venture.[3]
1983 – Cal Dive Intl. was acquired by Diversified Energy International (DEI) whose financial backing allowed the company to expand with two converted diving vessels.
1985 –Handleman suffered a severe injury in a skiing accident and as a result was paralyzed from the waist down. Jim Nelson would take over the company and Handleman served as a consultant with the company for five more years.[4]
1990 – Led by new CEO Jerry Reuhl, a management team that included future-CEO Owen Kratz, purchased Cal Dive Intl. from DEI for $11 million with Merrill Lynch acting as the financial partner, providing all of the holding a 45% equity position.[5]
1992 – After establishing a business model of acquiring offshore oil and gas properties near the end of their production life in the Gulf of Mexico, Cal Dive Intl. created a subsidiary called Energy Resource Technology (ERT) to manage its growing portfolio of Gulf shelf properties.
1993 Cal Dive Intl. management bought Merrill Lynch out in 1993, and then sold 50% of the company to First Reserve Corporation in 1995, to raise more capital to support a growing deepwater program.
1994 – Cal Dive Intl. acquires its first Dynamically Positioned vessel, the Witch Queen which allowed the company to enter the deepwater market in the Gulf of Mexico for the first time.
1996 – Cal Dive Intl. acquires the Uncle John semi-submersible drilling rig and extends the company’s well intervention capabilities. Cal Dive Intl. also purchased offshore energy company Aquaitica Inc. which was the company’s first corporate acquisition and added four shallow water diving support vessels to its fleet.
1997 –Kratz succeeds Reuhl as CEO. Kratz had previously served as the COO and Executive Vice President. Kratz was an accomplished oilfield diver who had previously owned his own marine construction company. Shortly after his ascension, Cal Dive Intl. became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
2001 – Cal Dive Intl. purchases Professional Divers of New Orleans for $11.5 million and acquired 85 percent of outstanding Canyon Offshore shares, and purchased the remaining 15 percent over the next three years. With the acquisition of Canyon Offshore, Cal Dive Intl. could now offer operators ROV, intervention and cable/flowline burial services.[6]
2002 – The world’s first deepsea well intervention semi-submersible, the Q4000, is launched into service in the Gulf of Mexico.[7]
2006 – Following the acquisition of Helix RDS,[8] a reservoir consultancy company, Cal Dive Intl. changed the corporate name to Helix Energy Solutions Group Inc.[9] to better reflect the company’s double-stranded business model of offering contracting services while also maintaining a role as an independent oil and gas producer. The company also moved its stock listing from NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol, HLX.
2008 – Newbuild well intervention vessel, Well Enhancer, is launched into service in the North Sea.[10]
2010 – Helix ESG deploys multiple assets and resources to contain the 2010 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill.[11]
2012 – Helix ESG announces divestiture plans regarding its subsea construction business unit,[12] Helix Subsea Construction, and the sale of its vessels. Helix ESG also announced that going forward well intervention and ROV services would be its primary contracting businesses and new vessels would be purchased or chartered to meet growing demand in those service sectors.
2015 – Helix Energy Solutions Group saw its profit tumble 78 percent in the fourth quarter as upstreams curb drilling activity.[13]
The Company[edit]
Helix ESG is divided into four business units:
Helix Well Ops[edit]
Provider of a range of well operation, subsea wireline and decommissioning services with specialist vessels and in-house developed equipment that includes the Subsea Intervention Lubricator and the Intervention Riser System. Well Ops’ assets include three purpose-built offshore units along with mobile equipment. As of 2012, at least three more intervention vessels were scheduled to be added to Well Ops fleet starting in 2013.[14] Current assets include:

Q4000
MSV Seawell
MSV Well Enhancer
Intervention Riser System (IRS), a tool used in subsea well intervention and subsea well containment. The IRS enables access to subsea well trees while isolating the wellbore pressure as downhole tools like wireline or coiled tubing are deployed or changed out. The IRS is rated to operate up to 10,000 ft of water and capable of a maximum working pressure of 10,000 psi. It is also a component of the Helix Fast Response System as an emergency intervention tool in the event of a subsea well incident in the Gulf of Mexico.
Subsea Intervention Lubricator (SIL), wireline or coiled tubing systems used in riserless and diverless subsea light well intervention in the offshore oil and gas industry. SILs allow access to a live subsea well without the requirement of a Blow Out Preventer stack or a marine riser. The deployment of a SIL from a dynamically positioned multi-service vessel (MSV) is significantly less expensive than using a traditional drilling rig for intervention operations. SILs are typically rated to operate between 300 ft and 10,000 ft of water and have maximum working pressures of 10,000 psi.

Canyon Offshore[edit]
A supplier of subsea intervention services that has been operating ROV support vessels and ROV trenching services globally since its inception in 1996. The company currently operates over 50 ROV and trenching systems including over 45 heavy work class systems and five trenching and cable trenching systems along with four support vessels. Canyon Offshore operates from three regions; Houston, Aberdeen and Singapore, to effectively service their international client base. Assets include:

Grand Canyon
Deep Cygnus
Olympic Triton
Olympic Canyon
Triton Work Class ROV Systems
UHD Work Class ROV Systems
I-Trencher
T1200 Trencher

Energy Resources Technology GOM, Inc.[edit]
Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. has sold its ERT business unit.
Production Facilities[edit]
Helix Production Facilities unit participates with offshore oil and gas producers through negotiated contracting, infrastructure ownership, and reservoir equity interests. Assets include:

Helix Producer I
Marco Polo
Independence Hub

Management[edit]
Owen Kratz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
Timeline[edit]
1980 – Oceaneering executives, Lad Handleman, John Swinden, Don Sites and Rick Foreman left the company and named their new company Cal Dive International. Oceaneering was formed in 1964 when Handelman merged his California oilfield diving company, Cal Dive, with Canadian-based Can-Dive and upon his departure Handleman reclaimed his original company name for the new venture.[3]
1983 – Cal Dive Intl. was acquired by Diversified Energy International (DEI) whose financial backing allowed the company to expand with two converted diving vessels.
1985 –Handleman suffered a severe injury in a skiing accident and as a result was paralyzed from the waist down. Jim Nelson would take over the company and Handleman served as a consultant with the company for five more years.[4]
1990 – Led by new CEO Jerry Reuhl, a management team that included future-CEO Owen Kratz, purchased Cal Dive Intl. from DEI for $11 million with Merrill Lynch acting as the financial partner, providing all of the holding a 45% equity position.[5]
1992 – After establishing a business model of acquiring offshore oil and gas properties near the end of their production life in the Gulf of Mexico, Cal Dive Intl. created a subsidiary called Energy Resource Technology (ERT) to manage its growing portfolio of Gulf shelf properties.
1993 Cal Dive Intl. management bought Merrill Lynch out in 1993, and then sold 50% of the company to First Reserve Corporation in 1995, to raise more capital to support a growing deepwater program.
1994 – Cal Dive Intl. acquires its first Dynamically Positioned vessel, the Witch Queen which allowed the company to enter the deepwater market in the Gulf of Mexico for the first time.
1996 – Cal Dive Intl. acquires the Uncle John semi-submersible drilling rig and extends the company’s well intervention capabilities. Cal Dive Intl. also purchased offshore energy company Aquaitica Inc. which was the company’s first corporate acquisition and added four shallow water diving support vessels to its fleet.
1997 –Kratz succeeds Reuhl as CEO. Kratz had previously served as the COO and Executive Vice President. Kratz was an accomplished oilfield diver who had previously owned his own marine construction company. Shortly after his ascension, Cal Dive Intl. became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
2001 – Cal Dive Intl. purchases Professional Divers of New Orleans for $11.5 million and acquired 85 percent of outstanding Canyon Offshore shares, and purchased the remaining 15 percent over the next three years. With the acquisition of Canyon Offshore, Cal Dive Intl. could now offer operators ROV, intervention and cable/flowline burial services.[6]
2002 – The world’s first deepsea well intervention semi-submersible, the Q4000, is launched into service in the Gulf of Mexico.[7]
2006 – Following the acquisition of Helix RDS,[8] a reservoir consultancy company, Cal Dive Intl. changed the corporate name to Helix Energy Solutions Group Inc.[9] to better reflect the company’s double-stranded business model of offering contracting services while also maintaining a role as an independent oil and gas producer. The company also moved its stock listing from NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol, HLX.
2008 – Newbuild well intervention vessel, Well Enhancer, is launched into service in the North Sea.[10]
2010 – Helix ESG deploys multiple assets and resources to contain the 2010 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill.[11]
2012 – Helix ESG announces divestiture plans regarding its subsea construction business unit,[12] Helix Subsea Construction, and the sale of its vessels. Helix ESG also announced that going forward well intervention and ROV services would be its primary contracting businesses and new vessels would be purchased or chartered to meet growing demand in those service sectors.
2015 – Helix Energy Solutions Group saw its profit tumble 78 percent in the fourth quarter as upstreams curb drilling activity.[13]
The Company[edit]
Helix ESG is divided into four business units:
Helix Well Ops[edit]
Provider of a range of well operation, subsea wireline and decommissioning services with specialist vessels and in-house developed equipment that includes the Subsea Intervention Lubricator and the Intervention Riser System. Well Ops’ assets include three purpose-built offshore units along with mobile equipment. As of 2012, at least three more intervention vessels were scheduled to be added to Well Ops fleet starting in 2013.[14] Current assets include:

Q4000
MSV Seawell
MSV Well Enhancer
Intervention Riser System (IRS), a tool used in subsea well intervention and subsea well containment. The IRS enables access to subsea well trees while isolating the wellbore pressure as downhole tools like wireline or coiled tubing are deployed or changed out. The IRS is rated to operate up to 10,000 ft of water and capable of a maximum working pressure of 10,000 psi. It is also a component of the Helix Fast Response System as an emergency intervention tool in the event of a subsea well incident in the Gulf of Mexico.
Subsea Intervention Lubricator (SIL), wireline or coiled tubing systems used in riserless and diverless subsea light well intervention in the offshore oil and gas industry. SILs allow access to a live subsea well without the requirement of a Blow Out Preventer stack or a marine riser. The deployment of a SIL from a dynamically positioned multi-service vessel (MSV) is significantly less expensive than using a traditional drilling rig for intervention operations. SILs are typically rated to operate between 300 ft and 10,000 ft of water and have maximum working pressures of 10,000 psi.

Canyon Offshore[edit]
A supplier of subsea intervention services that has been operating ROV support vessels and ROV trenching services globally since its inception in 1996. The company currently operates over 50 ROV and trenching systems including over 45 heavy work class systems and five trenching and cable trenching systems along with four support vessels. Canyon Offshore operates from three regions; Houston, Aberdeen and Singapore, to effectively service their international client base. Assets include:

Grand Canyon
Deep Cygnus
Olympic Triton
Olympic Canyon
Triton Work Class ROV Systems
UHD Work Class ROV Systems
I-Trencher
T1200 Trencher

Energy Resources Technology GOM, Inc.[edit]
Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. has sold its ERT business unit.
Production Facilities[edit]
Helix Production Facilities unit participates with offshore oil and gas producers through negotiated contracting, infrastructure ownership, and reservoir equity interests. Assets include:

Helix Producer I
Marco Polo
Independence Hub

Management[edit]
Owen Kratz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc.

Helix Well Ops
The Global Leader In Subsea Well Intervention
















From playing a key role in the Macondo deepwater oil spill response to end-of-life Plug and Abandonment work, Helix Well Ops is the established leader in rigless offshore well intervention, providing fast, flexible and high-quality well management services.
Our specialized well intervention vessels and subsea systems operating worldwide provide value throughout the well life cycle, allowing rigs to focus on what they do best.  Keeping drilling rigs on task ensures maximum productivity and operational efficiency, particularly on extended drilling campaigns.
Helix Well Ops supports these offshore assets with proven project management support, including engineering and manpower.  With more than 900 well intervention operations performed around the world, our project teams and offshore crews deliver peerless levels of experience and real-world expertise.
The Helix Well Ops vessel fleet includes monohull and semisubmersibles purpose built for well intervention operations.  Seawell pioneered modern offshore intervention techniques in the North Sea, and has the most comprehensive track record of any vessel in the business.  Well Enhancer is the industry’s first monohull designed to perform coiled tubing intervention work, realizing dramatic efficiency gains versus similar jobs on drilling rigs.  The Q4000 semisub features a large deck layout and 600 mT multipurpose tower, making her the go-to vessel when operational flexibility and endurance are critical.

About Helix // Who We Are






















Who We Are
About Helix Energy Solutions




 
Helix's roots begin in the 1960s with a group of pioneering oilfield divers whose work made possible many of the advancements in the offshore industry that are taken for granted today. Now we specialize in overcoming new offshore challenges using a fleet of unrivaled vessels that operate on subsea fields in every major producing region in the world. 
We are the world's preeminent contractor for live well intervention, which has helped to establish us as one of the industry's solutions for containing potential future subsea oil spills.  We also offer one of the widest selections of specialized work-class ROVs available anywhere in the world.  At Helix our employees take pride in being part of a global company that has set industry records and continues to make the most of opportunities where others see none at all. We have made a name for ourselves by inventing new techniques and technology to meet the demands of producing oil and gas thousands of feet underwater – the harshest environment on the planet.

What We Do









About Helix // What We Do






















What We Do
Market Leaders in Specialized Disciplines




 
WELL INTERVENTION
 
From playing a key role in the Macondo deepwater oil spill response to end-of-life Plug and Abandonment (P&A) work, Helix Well Ops is an established leader in rigless offshore well intervention, providing fast, flexible and high-quality well management services.  Our specialized well intervention vessels and subsea systems operating worldwide provide value throughout the life cycle of the well, allowing rigs to focus on what they do best.  Keeping drilling rigs on task ensures maximum productivity and operational efficiency, particularly on extended drilling campaigns.
 
SUBSEA CONTRACTING
 
Helix's marine contracting business unit Canyon Offshore is a leading supplier of subsea engineering services, operating state of the art Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs), seabed trenching and geotechnical vehicles, and support vessels.  Our deepwater ROV track record spans 17 years, including oil and gas, renewable energy, subsea mining, and specialty services projects executed successfully around the world.
 
PRODUCTION FACILITIES
 
Helix's Production Facilities unit participates with offshore oil & gas producers through negotiating contracts, infrastructure ownership, and reservoir equity interests. Our goal is to provide clients with creative and innovative offshore oil & gas development solutions which provide significant economic, schedule, and quality advantages. Our specialty and primary area of focus is Marginal Prospects. Key building blocks for development projects include:
 

Full-Field Development Focus
Helix-Owned Production Infrastructure which is leased to the producer
Relatively Short Minimum Lease Terms
Bundled Marine Contracting Services
Alignment of Helix and Producer interests.

 
Helix Marginal Prospect Development strategies can be broken-down broadly into Area-wide or Re-Deployable.
 

Area-Wide —  looks to build a hub facility that ties-back and processes production from multiple area prospects.
Re-Deployable — utilizes a floating production system that can produce and deplete marginal fields within a relatively short time frame (3 to 5 years) and then be moved to a new location to repeat the process.

 
SUBSEA SERVICES ALLIANCES
 
In January 2015, Helix, OneSubsea and Schlumberger formed the Subsea Services Alliance to develop technologies and deliver equipment and services to optimize the value chain of subsea well intervention systems. The Alliance combines the expertise and capabilities of the three companies to provide a unique offering, integrating marine support with well access equipment and control technologies.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Mattress Stores Are Greedy.

Learn the Truth Now










A mattress shouldn’t cost a fortune
Over-priced, over-complicated mattresses have been the standard. Until now.


Unfair markups
Typically, mattresses are marked up 6-12 times by the time they’re sold. That means you’re mostly paying for gimmicks, unfair retail markups, sales commissions, and wholesaler’s profits.

Big Mattress





                Often gimmicky marketing,
                
                unfair retail markups,
                
                sales commissions,
                
                and overwhelming options.
              






                Most mattress companies use the same four ingredients.
                But not us.

Big Mattress thinks “Innovating” means “rearranging outdated materials to charge you more money.” It’s all these same 4 old layers, mixed and matched under different names so you can't compare and cross shop:

The problem with latex is pressure relief. Because the more you  push on it, the more it pushes back. This causes painful pressure  points. Latex is an outdated material that mattress companies just never stopped using.







02 Memory Foam
Memory Foam has no bounce. It's like sleeping in quicksand. And once you’re stuck, you start getting hot.







03 Springs
Why is coiled steel considered comfortable? Spring mattresses are mostly empty space, so you get mostly empty support.







04 Egg Crate Foam
So-called “Egg Crate” layers are a single block of foam cut in half, then disguised as a bonus feature. It’s an easy way for mattress companies to charge you more while selling you less.








T&N Adaptive® Foam. Innovation by us, perfected by you.
The mattress industry hadn’t changed in years, aside from adding new sales tricks and gimmicks. So when we started Tuft & Needle, we worked to innovate something entirely new for the industry. Unparalleled in comfort and support, our proprietary foam was painstakingly perfected through customer feedback. It’s not memory foam. It’s not latex. It’s T&N Adaptive® Foam. And because it adapts to every individual’s body, you’ll always sleep on the ideal firmness for you.

T&N Adaptive® Foam
Our key innovation is T&N Adaptive® Foam. It   offers a gradient of support, so the more pressure you apply,   the more it adapts to support you.










Zillion layer mattresses are a scam







More layers means hot sleeping


Tuft & Needle



We’ve worked hard to reduce our layers down to the   essential two. The performance of your sleep surface is what  matters most because it provides the comfort you feel and the  interaction your body needs. Our innovative foam is what makes   this all possible.


Other Guys



Every mattress layer adds a layer of glue, and every layer of glue reduces airflow. Reduced airflow means hot sleeping, and paying for extra layers you won’t feel.






Cutting costs, direct to you.

Premium polyurethane foam crafted in California, USA.

                      Our entire mattress has earned UL GREENGUARD Gold Certification. GREENGUARD Certified products aid in the creation of healthier indoor environments, and release fewer pollutants that can contribute to health issues including asthma and other respiratory issues. This GREENGUARD label validates that the T&N Mattress is low-emitting and supports healthy indoor environments. UL is a global independent safety science company with more than a century of expertise innovating safety solutions. For more information, check out the GREENGUARD Certification website
                      here.

Our foam is tested and certified by CertiPUR-US® to meet high standards in physical performance, content, indoor emissions and environmental stewardship.
Two-layer blended foam designed by and proprietary to Tuft & Needle. The support foam layer is a high-density poly-foam. The density is about 1.8 lbs/cubic ft.
The comfort foam layer is a very high-density foam that we created to achieve our universally comfortable, cool and responsive properties. The density is about 2.8 lbs/cubic ft.


Our T&N Mattress cover is made with a blend of Polyester and Tactel (nylon). It has a soft feel which is very pleasant to the touch.
Tactel is commonly used in clothing for men, women and children as an alternative to cotton. It is also known to dry 6-8 times faster than cotton, which helps you sleep cooler, longer.
With durability in mind, we've designed a fabric that will last. Our Mattress cover fabric is pilling and tearing resistant.
Our T&N Mattress cover has been tested and certified by OEKO-TEX®. OEKO-TEX® tests for harmful substances in textiles and materials. The more intensive the skin contact of a product and the more sensitive the skin, the stricter the human-ecological requirements that need to be complied with.
We are proud to hold the STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX®: Class I certification on the T&N Mattress cover. While our mattress was not designed for babies and toddlers, the STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX®: Class I certification signifies that all parts of an article meet the OEKO-TEX® requirements for a product used by babies and toddlers up to 3 years of age.

                      For more information about OEKO-TEX® standards, click
                      here.



U.S. law requires that every mattress sold needs to pass two very specific burn tests: an "open flame" test and a "cigarette" test.
In order to pass these two tests, a mattress typically needs to have a component known as a fire barrier that self extinguishes the mattress when on fire.
We've done a lot of research as a team and decided the best solution for our T&N Mattress was a fire sock flame barrier. This component is permanently installed around the foam core of our mattress which is then fully encased within the outer cover. You will not come into contact with the sock unless you unzip and remove the outer cover of your mattress, which we do not recommend.
If you believe it is necessary to remove the cover (for example, to clean it more thoroughly in the case of serious spills or soiling), we recommend that you contact us before doing so.  We may be able to offer tips to avoid potential issues with removing and replacing the cover.  In any event, our mattress cover should never be machine washed.
Our fire barrier doesn't contain any fire retardant chemicals. Instead, it's a tubular knitted fabric (often referred to as a "fire sock"), composed of four inert fibers and is inherently flame retardant.
Our fire barrier has been tested and certified by OEKO-TEX®. OEKO-TEX® tests for harmful substances in textiles and materials. The more intensive the skin contact of a product and the more sensitive the skin, the stricter the human-ecological requirements that need to be complied with.
We are proud to hold the STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX®: Class I certification on the T&N Mattress fire barrier. While our mattress was not designed for babies and toddlers, the STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX®: Class I certification signifies that all parts of an article meet the OEKO-TEX® requirements for a product used by babies and toddlers up to 3 years of age.

                      For more information about OEKO-TEX® standards, click
                      here.

Our fire barrier satisfies both the 1633 (open flame) and 1632 (cigarette) burn test requirements.
We do not use any flame retardant chemicals in the making of our foam.

JT Marino & Daehee Park
Why We Started

Tuft & Needle was inspired after co-founder JT Marino and his wife went shopping for their first big purchase as newlyweds — a mattress. Their unfortunate mattress shopping experience, and purchase of a $3500 overpriced and uncomfortable mattress led to restless nights and buyer’s remorse for JT.
After sharing his painful story with his good friend, Daehee Park, they commiserated on the severity of the problem. They realized most mattress companies were marking up prices by almost 10x. “It became emotional at that point,” Daehee says, “We felt robbed.”
Co-founders JT and Daehee launched Tuft & Needle in 2012 to change the way mattresses were designed and sold. They pioneered the single model, universally comfortable mattress. JT explains, “Our mattress is made with foam engineered by us, conveniently compressed into a small box, and delivered free of charge to our customer’s door.”
With no investors, Marino and Park started with $6000. They have bootstrapped the company and relentlessly focused on making the business as efficient as possible, cutting out the waste and passing on the savings to customers.






We Left Memory Foam In The Past.
Forget about Latex and Springs too.

T&N Adaptive® Foam, engineered by us, is the first of its kind.
The result of a partnership with the world’s leading foam scientists, our unique formula was tested, refined, and perfected at the molecular level.
T&N Adaptive® Foam allows us to deliver both comfort and support in a  single material, whereas other brands are forced to mix and match layers using traditional materials like memory foam and latex. These are then labeled “premium”- a marketing trick used to hide the drawbacks of stacked layers.
Fact: Individual mattress layers compete with each other when stacked. As a result, the specific benefits of each layer are often canceled. We’ve proven performance on the sleep surface is what matters most. With T&N Adaptive® Foam atop our base layer, you’ll secure all the benefits of the “other guys” 3-7 layers in just 2 - the fewest layers of any competitor, and as a result, the most efficiently manufactured. We pass the savings onto you.




 


Affordable and high-quality, with nothing to hide.






Soft Without The Sink: Perfect For Side, Back & Stomach Sleepers.
The Tuft & Needle mattress is soft and comfy while still being bouncy and supportive.


After thousands of reviews, emails and phone calls from our customers, we’ve made over 100 iterations to our mattress. The result is far greater than any focus group could ever produce. Real feedback in real-time has helped us perfect our product.








              T&N Adaptive
              TM
              Foam
            
We’ve engineered a new foam based purely on customer feedback. It captures the best benefits of memory foam and latex while leaving their negative attributes behind.





Supportive Base Layer
Our custom T&N Adaptive® Foam is paired with a high quality support layer that forms the perfect foundation for our mattress.





Ideal Support
Our foam is ideal for sleepers of any size or weight – and this is what makes it unique. The more pressure you put on it, the more it reacts to support you.








No Tricky Tactics Disguised As Features.
Junk science doesn’t keep you cool, common sense does.



Our mattress is designed to draw heat out in four simple ways.







1. Heat Wicking
Heat is drawn into the mattress where gel and graphite work together to disperse heat outward and away from your body.






2. Breathable
With the help of our fabric, air flows through the foam cells to boost the speed of heat transfer through the mattress.






3. No More Quicksand
Our support layer helps hold you closer to the surface to avoid the oven effect caused by sinking in too deeply.






4. Fewer Layers
Other brands use lots-o-layers of random foams containing different cell structures. Together, our 2 layers create uniform breathability.








You Should Only Pay for What Matters.
Fancy wordplay gets tiring, because it “sounds” expensive doesn’t mean it should be.


With Tuft & Needle, price is not a reflection of quality. Consumers are trained to think that high priced goods are always better. But a quality mattress can be honestly and fairly priced. So we designed an incredible mattress, then focused on reasonable pricing by increasing efficiency and cutting out the needless costs that normally are passed on to consumers.






The Truth Is: We’re Cutting Costs, Not Corners.
We run our own supply chain and sell direct to you.













Our Two Layers Are All You Need.
The other guys add layers to make it more expensive, while stripping away benefits.






            Tuft & Needle
            2 Layers





            Everybody Else
            3 - 7 Layers



Every layer of foam or material needs a layer of glue and every layer of glue reduces air-flow. Reduced airflow means hot sleeping and paying for fancy material 7 layers deep that has no impact on your sleep. We’ve worked hard to reduce our layers down to the essential two. The performance of your sleep surface is what matters most because it provides the comfort you feel and the interaction your body needs. Our innovative foam is what makes this all possible.
