The Spring Creek Mine shipped approximately 10.3 million tons of low sulfur, 9,283 Btu coal in 2016. Coal mined from Spring Creek is shipped primarily to electric utilities and industrial customers in the northwest, midwest, northeast and southwest United States, various Canadian provinces and exported to Asian utility customers via the Westshore terminal in British Columbia, Canada.
In 2005 and again in 2009 Spring Creek Mine received the Excellence in Surface Mining and Reclamation Award from the Office of Surface Mining.

- Rental shall not be
credited against either production or advance royalties for any
year.
 
Sec. 2.(a) PRODUCTION ROYALTIES -
The royalty shall be 12.5 percent of
the value of the coal as set forth in the regulations. Royalties
are due to Lessor the final day of the month succeeding the
calendar month in which the royalty obligation accrues.
 

(b) ADVANCE ROYALTIES
- Upon request by the
Lessee, the authorized officer may accept, for a total of not more
than 10 years, the payment of advance royalties in lieu of
continued operation, consistent with the regulations. The advance
royalty shall be based on a percent of the value of a minimum
number of tons determined in the manner established by the advance
royalty regulations in effect at the time the Lessee requests
approval to pay advance royalties in lieu of continued
operation.
 
Sec. 3. BONDS - Lessee shall maintain in the proper office a
lease bond in the amount of $5,000.00. The authorized officer may
require an increase in this amount when additional coverage is
determined appropriate.
 
Sec. 4. DILIGENCE —
This lease achieved diligent
development on September 1, 1982, and is subject to the
conditions of continued operation. Continued operation may be
excused when operations under the lease are interrupted by strikes,
the elements, or casualties not attributable to the Lessee. The
Lessor, in the public interest, may suspend the condition of
continued operation upon payment of advance royalties in accordance
with the regulations in existence at the time of the
suspension.
 
The Lessor reserves the power to assent to or
order the suspension of the terms and conditions of this lease in
accordance with, inter alia, Section 39 of the Mineral
Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C. 209.
 
Sec. 5. LOGICAL MINING UNIT (LMU) -
Either upon approval by the Lessor of the Lessee’s
application or at the direction of the Lessor, this lease shall
become an LMU or part of an LMU, subject to the provisions set
forth in the regulations.
 
The stipulations established in an LMU approval
in effect at the time of LMU approval or modification will
supersede the relevant inconsistent terms of this lease so long as
the lease remains committed to the LMU. If the LMU of which this
lease is a part is dissolved, the lease shall then be subject to
the lease terms which would have been applied if the lease had not
been included in the LMU.
 
Sec. 6. DOCUMENTS, EVIDENCE AND INSPECTION
- At such times and in
such form as Lessor may prescribe, Lessee shall furnish detailed
statements showing the amounts and quality of all products removed
and sold from the lease, the proceeds therefrom, and the amount
used for production purposes or unavoidably lost.
 
Lessee shall keep open at all reasonable times
for the inspection of any duly authorized officer of Lessor, the
leased premises and all surface and underground improvements,
works, machinery, ore stockpiles, equipment, and all books,
accounts, maps, and records relative to operations, surveys, or
investigations on or under the leased lands.
 
Lessee shall allow Lessor access to and copying
of documents reasonably necessary to verify Lessee compliance with
terms and conditions of the lease.
 
While this lease remains in effect, information
obtained under this section shall be closed to inspection by the
public in accordance with the Freedom of Information Action (5
U.S.C. 552).

comply at its own expense with all reasonable orders of the
Secretary, respecting diligent operations, prevention of waste, and
protection of other resources.
