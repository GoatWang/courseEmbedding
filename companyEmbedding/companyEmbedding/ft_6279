        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!

        Ford has earned the No. 2 ranking of all non-premium brands in this
        year’s J.D. Power Initial Quality Study – the brand’s best ranking in
        the report’s 31-year history
      

        Expedition and Mustang earn segment quality awards, with seven Ford
        and Lincoln models leading the top three of their segments
      

        Ford’s has been improving the capability and quality of new
        technologies, including SYNC 3 equipped on 70 percent of vehicles
      


DEARBORN, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 21, 2017--
      Ford has jumped to No. 2 of all non-premium brands in J.D. Power’s 2017
      Initial Quality Study – the brand’s best-ever ranking in the annual
      study now in its 31st year.

Ford has earned the No. 2 ranking of all non-premium brands in this year’s J.D. Power Initial Quality Study – Ford’s best ranking in the 31-year history of the report (Photo: Business Wire)  


      The Ford brand improved to 86 problems per 100 vehicles from 102 in
      2016. This improvement helped Ford tie for fourth among all brands from
      11th in 2016.
    

      “As Ford accelerates the pace of innovation, we believe this best-ever
      quality ranking demonstrates our new technologies are reliable and easy
      to use,” said Bennie Fowler, group vice president, Quality. “The rapid
      improvements rated by third-party quality experts such as J.D. Power
      motivate us to improve our fitness even more as quality is a race that’s
      never finished.”
    

      Seven Ford and Lincoln vehicles are in the top three in their respective
      segments. Ford Expedition and Mustang took top quality honors in their
      segments.
    

      Ford is delivering new innovations with better quality than average as
      the industry has faced challenges rolling out new advancements such as
      connectivity and driver-assist features. Specifically, Ford is:
    


        Equipping approximately 70 percent of vehicles with advanced SYNC 3
        technology with significant quality improvements
      

        Offering more models in the United States with popular driver-assist
        features such as adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning
        than any other full-line manufacturer.
      

        Continuing the rapid rollout of advanced EcoBoost engine technology
        and lightweighting innovations such as aluminum-bodied F-Series trucks
        – combining to deliver improved performance, capability and efficiency.
      


      “We are moving into an exciting new period of innovation in
      transportation, so it is very important to keep the human experience at
      the center of all we do, including delivering any new technology with
      quality,” said Fowler.
