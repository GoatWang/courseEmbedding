History[edit]
Tenneco, Inc.'s origin was in the Chicago Corporation, established about 1930.[5] Tennessee Gas and Transmission Company (completely separate) had been formed in 1940.[6]
Natural gas[edit]
A shortage of fuel for World War II defense industries in the Appalachian area developed when industrial production was increased. The nuclear development operations of the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee consumed huge quantities of Tennessee Valley Authority electrical power that would have otherwise been available to other industrial operations. The Chicago Corporation was able to acquire a Federal Power Commission (FPC) license to build a pipeline from Texas to Appalachia, eventually expanding to the largest natural gas pipeline network in the United States. These pipelines were acquired by El Paso Corporation in 1996, and are now owned by Kinder Morgan and others.
Diversification[edit]
In the 1950s, the company acquired existing oil companies, including Sterling Oil, Del-Key Petroleum, and Bay Petroleum.[7] The Tennessee division of the Chicago Corporation acquired Tennessee Gas Transmission Company in 1943 to build a natural-gas pipeline 1,265 miles (2,036 km) from Texas to West Virginia. The first line was completed in October 1944. It was followed by three additional pipelines totaling 3,840 miles (6,180 km)[6] during the next 15 years which provide gas to New York and New Jersey.[8]
In 1966, Tennessee Gas was incorporated as Tenneco, Inc.[5] Tenneco expanded into a number of business ventures as a result of diversification. Tenneco bought Houston Oil & Minerals Corporation in the late 1970s. Tenneco owned and operated a large number of gasoline service stations, but all were closed or replaced with other brands by the mid-1990s.[6]

In the 1970s, Tenneco purchased 53% of J.I. Case when they purchased its owner Kern County Land Company, the agricultural equipment manufacturer based in Racine, Wisconsin, USA.[9] In 1972, Tenneco purchased UK-based David Brown Tractors Ltd. and merged it with the J.I. Case business. In 1984, Case parent Tenneco bought selected assets of the International Harvester agriculture division and merged it with J.I. Case. All agriculture products are first labeled Case International and later Case IH. Tenneco purchased the articulated 4WD manufacturer Steiger Tractor in 1986, and merged it into Case IH.
The corporate direction was to buy failing companies, and work to develop them into market leaders. This worked well with Newport News Shipbuilding, but failed miserably with the various tractor companies, probably due in large part to the economy at the time. By 1988, the company was losing $2 million per day. After being pressured by the banks, it was decided to sell off the oil business. Tenneco Oil Exploration Company was split up and sold off to multiple buyers.
By 1994, Tenneco decided to begin getting out of the ag business and agreed to sell 35% of the now named Case Corporation.[10] In 1996, the spin-off of Case Corporation was completed. The company was acquired by Fiat in 1999 and merged with New Holland Agriculture to form CNH Global.[11]
Consolidation[edit]
Tenneco Inc. emerged from a conglomerate consisting of six unrelated businesses: shipbuilding, packaging, farm and construction equipment, gas transmission, automotive, and chemicals.[12] The automotive division was spun off from Tenneco, Inc. in 1991 along with the packaging, energy, natural gas, and shipbuilding divisions.[6] All businesses except automotive and packaging were disposed of between 1994 and 1996 (through public offerings, sales, spin-offs and mergers).[12] In 1999, Tenneco Packaging was spun off and renamed to Packaging Corporation of America (Pactiv Corporation).[12]
Since the 1960s Tenneco Automotive sold mufflers (UK: silencers) in Europe, including through the chain "Pit Stop" in Germany. The group bought a German factory in Virnheim in 1969, Swedish Starla in 1974 and French Bellanger and English Harmo Industries in 1976 and Danish Lydex in 1978. More acquisitions followed.[13]
On October 28, 2005 the name was changed from Tenneco Automotive to Tenneco.[14]
Tenneco (under the Tenneco Automotive name) sponsored CART's Detroit Grand Prix from 1999 until the race's cancellation after 2001.[citation needed]
Operations[edit]
Tenneco is a multi-national corporation with 93 manufacturing facilities in 26 countries located on 6 continents, with major centers of operations in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. There were 30,000 employees in 2016[citation needed]. The North American manufacturing facilities are located in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and Ohio; the corporate headquarters is located in Lake Forest, Illinois, European facilities in Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, UK, France, Spain and Portugal, with headquarters located in Belgium, Asian facilities include in India, China, Singapore and Japan, Australian Facilities are in Sydney, Morea (New Zealand)[clarification needed] and Clovelly Park and African Facility includes South Africa's Port Elizabeth.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Tenneco, Inc.'s origin was in the Chicago Corporation, established about 1930.[5] Tennessee Gas and Transmission Company (completely separate) had been formed in 1940.[6]
Natural gas[edit]
A shortage of fuel for World War II defense industries in the Appalachian area developed when industrial production was increased. The nuclear development operations of the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee consumed huge quantities of Tennessee Valley Authority electrical power that would have otherwise been available to other industrial operations. The Chicago Corporation was able to acquire a Federal Power Commission (FPC) license to build a pipeline from Texas to Appalachia, eventually expanding to the largest natural gas pipeline network in the United States. These pipelines were acquired by El Paso Corporation in 1996, and are now owned by Kinder Morgan and others.
Diversification[edit]
In the 1950s, the company acquired existing oil companies, including Sterling Oil, Del-Key Petroleum, and Bay Petroleum.[7] The Tennessee division of the Chicago Corporation acquired Tennessee Gas Transmission Company in 1943 to build a natural-gas pipeline 1,265 miles (2,036 km) from Texas to West Virginia. The first line was completed in October 1944. It was followed by three additional pipelines totaling 3,840 miles (6,180 km)[6] during the next 15 years which provide gas to New York and New Jersey.[8]
In 1966, Tennessee Gas was incorporated as Tenneco, Inc.[5] Tenneco expanded into a number of business ventures as a result of diversification. Tenneco bought Houston Oil & Minerals Corporation in the late 1970s. Tenneco owned and operated a large number of gasoline service stations, but all were closed or replaced with other brands by the mid-1990s.[6]

In the 1970s, Tenneco purchased 53% of J.I. Case when they purchased its owner Kern County Land Company, the agricultural equipment manufacturer based in Racine, Wisconsin, USA.[9] In 1972, Tenneco purchased UK-based David Brown Tractors Ltd. and merged it with the J.I. Case business. In 1984, Case parent Tenneco bought selected assets of the International Harvester agriculture division and merged it with J.I. Case. All agriculture products are first labeled Case International and later Case IH. Tenneco purchased the articulated 4WD manufacturer Steiger Tractor in 1986, and merged it into Case IH.
The corporate direction was to buy failing companies, and work to develop them into market leaders. This worked well with Newport News Shipbuilding, but failed miserably with the various tractor companies, probably due in large part to the economy at the time. By 1988, the company was losing $2 million per day. After being pressured by the banks, it was decided to sell off the oil business. Tenneco Oil Exploration Company was split up and sold off to multiple buyers.
By 1994, Tenneco decided to begin getting out of the ag business and agreed to sell 35% of the now named Case Corporation.[10] In 1996, the spin-off of Case Corporation was completed. The company was acquired by Fiat in 1999 and merged with New Holland Agriculture to form CNH Global.[11]
Consolidation[edit]
Tenneco Inc. emerged from a conglomerate consisting of six unrelated businesses: shipbuilding, packaging, farm and construction equipment, gas transmission, automotive, and chemicals.[12] The automotive division was spun off from Tenneco, Inc. in 1991 along with the packaging, energy, natural gas, and shipbuilding divisions.[6] All businesses except automotive and packaging were disposed of between 1994 and 1996 (through public offerings, sales, spin-offs and mergers).[12] In 1999, Tenneco Packaging was spun off and renamed to Packaging Corporation of America (Pactiv Corporation).[12]
Since the 1960s Tenneco Automotive sold mufflers (UK: silencers) in Europe, including through the chain "Pit Stop" in Germany. The group bought a German factory in Virnheim in 1969, Swedish Starla in 1974 and French Bellanger and English Harmo Industries in 1976 and Danish Lydex in 1978. More acquisitions followed.[13]
On October 28, 2005 the name was changed from Tenneco Automotive to Tenneco.[14]
Tenneco (under the Tenneco Automotive name) sponsored CART's Detroit Grand Prix from 1999 until the race's cancellation after 2001.[citation needed]
Operations[edit]
Tenneco is a multi-national corporation with 93 manufacturing facilities in 26 countries located on 6 continents, with major centers of operations in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. There were 30,000 employees in 2016[citation needed]. The North American manufacturing facilities are located in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and Ohio; the corporate headquarters is located in Lake Forest, Illinois, European facilities in Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, UK, France, Spain and Portugal, with headquarters located in Belgium, Asian facilities include in India, China, Singapore and Japan, Australian Facilities are in Sydney, Morea (New Zealand)[clarification needed] and Clovelly Park and African Facility includes South Africa's Port Elizabeth.[citation needed]
Tenneco owns the following brands:

Monroe[15]
Walker[16]
Rancho[17]
DynoMax[18]
Clevite Elastomers[19]
Gillet[20]
Fonos[21]

History[edit]
Tenneco, Inc.'s origin was in the Chicago Corporation, established about 1930.[5] Tennessee Gas and Transmission Company (completely separate) had been formed in 1940.[6]
Natural gas[edit]
A shortage of fuel for World War II defense industries in the Appalachian area developed when industrial production was increased. The nuclear development operations of the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee consumed huge quantities of Tennessee Valley Authority electrical power that would have otherwise been available to other industrial operations. The Chicago Corporation was able to acquire a Federal Power Commission (FPC) license to build a pipeline from Texas to Appalachia, eventually expanding to the largest natural gas pipeline network in the United States. These pipelines were acquired by El Paso Corporation in 1996, and are now owned by Kinder Morgan and others.
Diversification[edit]
In the 1950s, the company acquired existing oil companies, including Sterling Oil, Del-Key Petroleum, and Bay Petroleum.[7] The Tennessee division of the Chicago Corporation acquired Tennessee Gas Transmission Company in 1943 to build a natural-gas pipeline 1,265 miles (2,036 km) from Texas to West Virginia. The first line was completed in October 1944. It was followed by three additional pipelines totaling 3,840 miles (6,180 km)[6] during the next 15 years which provide gas to New York and New Jersey.[8]
In 1966, Tennessee Gas was incorporated as Tenneco, Inc.[5] Tenneco expanded into a number of business ventures as a result of diversification. Tenneco bought Houston Oil & Minerals Corporation in the late 1970s. Tenneco owned and operated a large number of gasoline service stations, but all were closed or replaced with other brands by the mid-1990s.[6]

In the 1970s, Tenneco purchased 53% of J.I. Case when they purchased its owner Kern County Land Company, the agricultural equipment manufacturer based in Racine, Wisconsin, USA.[9] In 1972, Tenneco purchased UK-based David Brown Tractors Ltd. and merged it with the J.I. Case business. In 1984, Case parent Tenneco bought selected assets of the International Harvester agriculture division and merged it with J.I. Case. All agriculture products are first labeled Case International and later Case IH. Tenneco purchased the articulated 4WD manufacturer Steiger Tractor in 1986, and merged it into Case IH.
The corporate direction was to buy failing companies, and work to develop them into market leaders. This worked well with Newport News Shipbuilding, but failed miserably with the various tractor companies, probably due in large part to the economy at the time. By 1988, the company was losing $2 million per day. After being pressured by the banks, it was decided to sell off the oil business. Tenneco Oil Exploration Company was split up and sold off to multiple buyers.
By 1994, Tenneco decided to begin getting out of the ag business and agreed to sell 35% of the now named Case Corporation.[10] In 1996, the spin-off of Case Corporation was completed. The company was acquired by Fiat in 1999 and merged with New Holland Agriculture to form CNH Global.[11]
Consolidation[edit]
Tenneco Inc. emerged from a conglomerate consisting of six unrelated businesses: shipbuilding, packaging, farm and construction equipment, gas transmission, automotive, and chemicals.[12] The automotive division was spun off from Tenneco, Inc. in 1991 along with the packaging, energy, natural gas, and shipbuilding divisions.[6] All businesses except automotive and packaging were disposed of between 1994 and 1996 (through public offerings, sales, spin-offs and mergers).[12] In 1999, Tenneco Packaging was spun off and renamed to Packaging Corporation of America (Pactiv Corporation).[12]
Since the 1960s Tenneco Automotive sold mufflers (UK: silencers) in Europe, including through the chain "Pit Stop" in Germany. The group bought a German factory in Virnheim in 1969, Swedish Starla in 1974 and French Bellanger and English Harmo Industries in 1976 and Danish Lydex in 1978. More acquisitions followed.[13]
On October 28, 2005 the name was changed from Tenneco Automotive to Tenneco.[14]
Tenneco (under the Tenneco Automotive name) sponsored CART's Detroit Grand Prix from 1999 until the race's cancellation after 2001.[citation needed]
Operations[edit]
Tenneco is a multi-national corporation with 93 manufacturing facilities in 26 countries located on 6 continents, with major centers of operations in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. There were 30,000 employees in 2016[citation needed]. The North American manufacturing facilities are located in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and Ohio; the corporate headquarters is located in Lake Forest, Illinois, European facilities in Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, UK, France, Spain and Portugal, with headquarters located in Belgium, Asian facilities include in India, China, Singapore and Japan, Australian Facilities are in Sydney, Morea (New Zealand)[clarification needed] and Clovelly Park and African Facility includes South Africa's Port Elizabeth.[citation needed]

Tenneco has introduced 57 new pad sets, including pads featuring premium ceramic formulations, for nearly 40 million vehicles as part of an expansion of the Monroe Brakes product line.
 



Tenneco Inc. has added dozens of Total Solution and Monroe ProSolution  pad sets to its Monroe Brakes product line. The new brake pads provide combined coverage of more than 53.2 million additional late-model European, Asian and North American passenger vehicles.
The company says the new part numbers represent the beginning of an aggressive coverage expansion planned for 2016. With the addition of the new part numbers, Total Solution brake pads are available for approximately 97% of passenger vehicles registered in North America. Monroe ProSolution coverage increases to 96% of the passenger car population.
Included among the 57 new Monroe Brakes part numbers are 31 pad sets featuring premium ceramic formulations, expanding the brand’s ceramic coverage offering.
“Our growing portfolio of ultra-premium and premium ceramic pads enables service providers not only to match the OE technology used on the majority of new passenger applications, but also to offer an alternative for customers who would like to upgrade from semi-metallic to ceramic pads,” says Tom Connelly, national sales and marketing manager, Monroe Brakes.
Total Solution brake pads include everything needed for the repair for most applications, enabling technicians to complete more high-quality brake jobs in less time, according to Tenneco. These pads feature ultra-premium ceramic or semi-metallic friction formulations and shim technologies, stainless steel noise reduction hardware, Sensory Locking backing plates, and wire wear sensors, where applicable. Tenneco also packages brake lubricant with each Total Solution pad set.
Monroe ProSolution brake pads are equipped with premium ceramic or semi-metallic friction formulations engineered for exceptional noise reduction, long pad life and superior stopping performance.
To learn more about the Monroe Brakes product line, contact a Monroe Brakes or Tenneco sales representative and visit www.monroebrakes.com.

History[edit]
Tenneco, Inc.'s origin was in the Chicago Corporation, established about 1930.[5] Tennessee Gas and Transmission Company (completely separate) had been formed in 1940.[6]
Natural gas[edit]
A shortage of fuel for World War II defense industries in the Appalachian area developed when industrial production was increased. The nuclear development operations of the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee consumed huge quantities of Tennessee Valley Authority electrical power that would have otherwise been available to other industrial operations. The Chicago Corporation was able to acquire a Federal Power Commission (FPC) license to build a pipeline from Texas to Appalachia, eventually expanding to the largest natural gas pipeline network in the United States. These pipelines were acquired by El Paso Corporation in 1996, and are now owned by Kinder Morgan and others.
Diversification[edit]
In the 1950s, the company acquired existing oil companies, including Sterling Oil, Del-Key Petroleum, and Bay Petroleum.[7] The Tennessee division of the Chicago Corporation acquired Tennessee Gas Transmission Company in 1943 to build a natural-gas pipeline 1,265 miles (2,036 km) from Texas to West Virginia. The first line was completed in October 1944. It was followed by three additional pipelines totaling 3,840 miles (6,180 km)[6] during the next 15 years which provide gas to New York and New Jersey.[8]
In 1966, Tennessee Gas was incorporated as Tenneco, Inc.[5] Tenneco expanded into a number of business ventures as a result of diversification. Tenneco bought Houston Oil & Minerals Corporation in the late 1970s. Tenneco owned and operated a large number of gasoline service stations, but all were closed or replaced with other brands by the mid-1990s.[6]

In the 1970s, Tenneco purchased 53% of J.I. Case when they purchased its owner Kern County Land Company, the agricultural equipment manufacturer based in Racine, Wisconsin, USA.[9] In 1972, Tenneco purchased UK-based David Brown Tractors Ltd. and merged it with the J.I. Case business. In 1984, Case parent Tenneco bought selected assets of the International Harvester agriculture division and merged it with J.I. Case. All agriculture products are first labeled Case International and later Case IH. Tenneco purchased the articulated 4WD manufacturer Steiger Tractor in 1986, and merged it into Case IH.
The corporate direction was to buy failing companies, and work to develop them into market leaders. This worked well with Newport News Shipbuilding, but failed miserably with the various tractor companies, probably due in large part to the economy at the time. By 1988, the company was losing $2 million per day. After being pressured by the banks, it was decided to sell off the oil business. Tenneco Oil Exploration Company was split up and sold off to multiple buyers.
By 1994, Tenneco decided to begin getting out of the ag business and agreed to sell 35% of the now named Case Corporation.[10] In 1996, the spin-off of Case Corporation was completed. The company was acquired by Fiat in 1999 and merged with New Holland Agriculture to form CNH Global.[11]
Consolidation[edit]
Tenneco Inc. emerged from a conglomerate consisting of six unrelated businesses: shipbuilding, packaging, farm and construction equipment, gas transmission, automotive, and chemicals.[12] The automotive division was spun off from Tenneco, Inc. in 1991 along with the packaging, energy, natural gas, and shipbuilding divisions.[6] All businesses except automotive and packaging were disposed of between 1994 and 1996 (through public offerings, sales, spin-offs and mergers).[12] In 1999, Tenneco Packaging was spun off and renamed to Packaging Corporation of America (Pactiv Corporation).[12]
Since the 1960s Tenneco Automotive sold mufflers (UK: silencers) in Europe, including through the chain "Pit Stop" in Germany. The group bought a German factory in Virnheim in 1969, Swedish Starla in 1974 and French Bellanger and English Harmo Industries in 1976 and Danish Lydex in 1978. More acquisitions followed.[13]
On October 28, 2005 the name was changed from Tenneco Automotive to Tenneco.[14]
Tenneco (under the Tenneco Automotive name) sponsored CART's Detroit Grand Prix from 1999 until the race's cancellation after 2001.[citation needed]
Operations[edit]
Tenneco is a multi-national corporation with 93 manufacturing facilities in 26 countries located on 6 continents, with major centers of operations in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. There were 30,000 employees in 2016[citation needed]. The North American manufacturing facilities are located in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and Ohio; the corporate headquarters is located in Lake Forest, Illinois, European facilities in Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, UK, France, Spain and Portugal, with headquarters located in Belgium, Asian facilities include in India, China, Singapore and Japan, Australian Facilities are in Sydney, Morea (New Zealand)[clarification needed] and Clovelly Park and African Facility includes South Africa's Port Elizabeth.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Tenneco, Inc.'s origin was in the Chicago Corporation, established about 1930.[5] Tennessee Gas and Transmission Company (completely separate) had been formed in 1940.[6]
Natural gas[edit]
A shortage of fuel for World War II defense industries in the Appalachian area developed when industrial production was increased. The nuclear development operations of the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee consumed huge quantities of Tennessee Valley Authority electrical power that would have otherwise been available to other industrial operations. The Chicago Corporation was able to acquire a Federal Power Commission (FPC) license to build a pipeline from Texas to Appalachia, eventually expanding to the largest natural gas pipeline network in the United States. These pipelines were acquired by El Paso Corporation in 1996, and are now owned by Kinder Morgan and others.
Diversification[edit]
In the 1950s, the company acquired existing oil companies, including Sterling Oil, Del-Key Petroleum, and Bay Petroleum.[7] The Tennessee division of the Chicago Corporation acquired Tennessee Gas Transmission Company in 1943 to build a natural-gas pipeline 1,265 miles (2,036 km) from Texas to West Virginia. The first line was completed in October 1944. It was followed by three additional pipelines totaling 3,840 miles (6,180 km)[6] during the next 15 years which provide gas to New York and New Jersey.[8]
In 1966, Tennessee Gas was incorporated as Tenneco, Inc.[5] Tenneco expanded into a number of business ventures as a result of diversification. Tenneco bought Houston Oil & Minerals Corporation in the late 1970s. Tenneco owned and operated a large number of gasoline service stations, but all were closed or replaced with other brands by the mid-1990s.[6]

In the 1970s, Tenneco purchased 53% of J.I. Case when they purchased its owner Kern County Land Company, the agricultural equipment manufacturer based in Racine, Wisconsin, USA.[9] In 1972, Tenneco purchased UK-based David Brown Tractors Ltd. and merged it with the J.I. Case business. In 1984, Case parent Tenneco bought selected assets of the International Harvester agriculture division and merged it with J.I. Case. All agriculture products are first labeled Case International and later Case IH. Tenneco purchased the articulated 4WD manufacturer Steiger Tractor in 1986, and merged it into Case IH.
The corporate direction was to buy failing companies, and work to develop them into market leaders. This worked well with Newport News Shipbuilding, but failed miserably with the various tractor companies, probably due in large part to the economy at the time. By 1988, the company was losing $2 million per day. After being pressured by the banks, it was decided to sell off the oil business. Tenneco Oil Exploration Company was split up and sold off to multiple buyers.
By 1994, Tenneco decided to begin getting out of the ag business and agreed to sell 35% of the now named Case Corporation.[10] In 1996, the spin-off of Case Corporation was completed. The company was acquired by Fiat in 1999 and merged with New Holland Agriculture to form CNH Global.[11]
Consolidation[edit]
Tenneco Inc. emerged from a conglomerate consisting of six unrelated businesses: shipbuilding, packaging, farm and construction equipment, gas transmission, automotive, and chemicals.[12] The automotive division was spun off from Tenneco, Inc. in 1991 along with the packaging, energy, natural gas, and shipbuilding divisions.[6] All businesses except automotive and packaging were disposed of between 1994 and 1996 (through public offerings, sales, spin-offs and mergers).[12] In 1999, Tenneco Packaging was spun off and renamed to Packaging Corporation of America (Pactiv Corporation).[12]
Since the 1960s Tenneco Automotive sold mufflers (UK: silencers) in Europe, including through the chain "Pit Stop" in Germany. The group bought a German factory in Virnheim in 1969, Swedish Starla in 1974 and French Bellanger and English Harmo Industries in 1976 and Danish Lydex in 1978. More acquisitions followed.[13]
On October 28, 2005 the name was changed from Tenneco Automotive to Tenneco.[14]
Tenneco (under the Tenneco Automotive name) sponsored CART's Detroit Grand Prix from 1999 until the race's cancellation after 2001.[citation needed]
Operations[edit]
Tenneco is a multi-national corporation with 93 manufacturing facilities in 26 countries located on 6 continents, with major centers of operations in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. There were 30,000 employees in 2016[citation needed]. The North American manufacturing facilities are located in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and Ohio; the corporate headquarters is located in Lake Forest, Illinois, European facilities in Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, UK, France, Spain and Portugal, with headquarters located in Belgium, Asian facilities include in India, China, Singapore and Japan, Australian Facilities are in Sydney, Morea (New Zealand)[clarification needed] and Clovelly Park and African Facility includes South Africa's Port Elizabeth.[citation needed]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
