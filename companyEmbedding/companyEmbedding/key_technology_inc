July 28--The world is being kind to a Walla Walla-based manufacturer of equipment widely used in agricultural product processing
Key Technology Inc. on Thursday reported big third-quarter gains in net sales and earnings this year compared to 2016. The company makes digital sorters, conveyors and processing equipment.
"Our third quarter orders were the highest quarterly order level in our company's history," Jack Ehren, president and CEO, said in a news release Wednesday. "We have also now delivered nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year quarterly order growth."
He attributed the gains to increased orders for equipment in the Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa region, but the largest increase was in North America, including orders totaling $8 million from a "significant" potato processor.
Sales for the three months that ended June 30 totaled $44.7 million, compared to $36.2 million for the quarter last year, the company stated in the release. Net earnings for the quarter were $3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $1.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share last year.
Key's net sales for the nine months that ended June 30 were $99.4 million, compared with $89.5 million for the period in 2016.

July 28--The world is being kind to a Walla Walla-based manufacturer of equipment widely used in agricultural product processing
Key Technology Inc. on Thursday reported big third-quarter gains in net sales and earnings this year compared to 2016. The company makes digital sorters, conveyors and processing equipment.
"Our third quarter orders were the highest quarterly order level in our company's history," Jack Ehren, president and CEO, said in a news release Wednesday. "We have also now delivered nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year quarterly order growth."
He attributed the gains to increased orders for equipment in the Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa region, but the largest increase was in North America, including orders totaling $8 million from a "significant" potato processor.
Sales for the three months that ended June 30 totaled $44.7 million, compared to $36.2 million for the quarter last year, the company stated in the release. Net earnings for the quarter were $3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $1.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share last year.
Key's net sales for the nine months that ended June 30 were $99.4 million, compared with $89.5 million for the period in 2016.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
