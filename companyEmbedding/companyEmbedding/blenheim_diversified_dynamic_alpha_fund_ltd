Blenheim Diversified Dynamic
Alpha Fund, L.L.C.

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        Diversified Dynamic Alpha Fund (DDA), which is managed by Blenheim Fund Management LLC (the "Manager"), is based on Global Macro and GTAA strategies, and aims to achieve consistent risk-adjusted absolute returns. The Fund has retained Blenheim Capital Management, B.V. (the "Advisor") as its trading advisor to implement these strategies. The top-down investment strategy builds on the investment philosophy of time-varying returns on risky assets within and across global equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, inflation and volatility that can be exploited over different investment horizons using various investment approaches and skills. Most of the positions are directional in nature and are implemented using mostly liquid instruments. The ability to go long and short global markets safeguards low correlation with the underlying markets over the long term. AUM is not disclosed.

MIRACLE TESTOSTERONE PILL NETS BIGGEST DEAL IN SHARK TANK HISTORY.
IS IT TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE? Written by Karen Brightwell. Published on 

       
Angela and Yoojin Kim, sisters from Korea, net the biggest deal in Shark Tank history as all 5 sharks teamed up to seed the company with an a staggering $2.5 million dollars! In just a short 6 months, their product has completely disrupted the Men's Health industry in Korean, and with the help of the Sharks, they are now ready to take over the world market. After a complete re-brand and re-packaging, the sisters are now ready to launch their new brand, TEST BOOST EXCEL, in the United States. See the amazing demonstration below that got the sharks ready to feed instantly!
Apparently the Kim sisters have invented a new chemical compound that boosts testosterone production in men, particularly men over 36, the average age in which testosterone has been shown to naturally diminish.  While there are a number of "supplements" on the market that are claiming to boost testosterone, the Kim sisters have created the first reuptake inhibitor (RI), making it particularly more effective at permanently retaining testosterone. RI's work by blocking the inhibiting the plasmalemmal transporter-mediated reuptake of a neurotransmitter from the synapse into the pre-synaptic neuron. What this means to men without a doctorate in chemistry: a permanent cure for erectile dysfunction.

Robert: "This is an industry that has been desperate for a cure for so long. I'm thrilled to be working with the Kim Sisters and am looking forward to scaling production."
The Men's Health industry is a massive market, but it's seldom reported on. Studies show that the majority of men over the age of 40 have had experiences with erectile dysfunction, and a shocking 80% of all men are unhappy with their size. There is obviously a huge potential for the Sharks to profit, but does the pill actually work?
We Decided To Put It To The Test!
In order to test the veracity of the Kim Sisters' product, Fox News needed a reporter to try it out. As a wife of 36 years to a husband who has been struggling with erectile dysfunction, I decided to volunteer. What did I have to lose?
After I placed my order, a few days later the pills arrived at my house. I couldn’t wait for us to get to bed — before he fell asleep, I gave him a pill saying that it was just a vitamin.
I’m kind of uncomfortable telling you about our crazy amazing experience but… since we’ll never meet offline I'll tell you the details:
In less than an hour my husband woke up with a super stiff erection, and believe me, when I say we banged for 1 hour and 45 minutes straight, that's no exaggeration!
His cock was so hard, and I've never had an orgasm like that... ever! We were both able to achieve multiple orgasms that night. There was tons screaming and a lot of sweat. I had the perfect ride, the best I’ve ever had! I was finally satisfied, and he was too. I expected the pill to work, but this was way more than I had expected.
What Was Our Result?


The Sharks had said that these pills were designed to increased men's size, and that’s exactly what happened with my hubby! I still find it hard to believe that this stuff turned him into a long, strong, wild beast in bed — and all for the price of a movie ticket and without any expensive prescription. I find the results to be worth every penny (I already ordered three more packs) — life is too valuable, and I’m not the kind of girl that skimps on pleasures.
So, I can definitely recommend these amazing  TEST BOOST EXCEL for anyone who wants to last longer in bed and for anyone who wants to improve their size. Don’t hesitate to use that sample offer of TEST BOOST EXCEL, and make sure you take it because now I’m FINALLY satisfied. On top of my hubby’s erections being on point, he is now way bigger than before and lasts way longer than ever before when we use it.
When reached for comment, The Sharks graciously provided Fox News with their promotional package: a limited selection of free samples of TEST BOOST EXCEL
(Note: please only sign up for one free sample per household. We have a limited number of free bottles.)

(Trial bottles running out fast. Claim now before stock expires**)

FIXED INCOME FUNDS
Fixed income is a type of investing or budgeting style for which real return rates or periodic income is received at regular intervals at reasonably predictable levels. Fixed-income budgeters and investors are often one and the same - typically retired individuals who rely on their investments to provide a regular, stable income stream.  Individuals who live on set amounts of periodically paid income face the risk that inflation will erode their spending power. Fixed-income investors receive set, regular payments that face the same inflation risk.           Income funds are named appropriately: their purpose is to provide current income on a steady basis. When referring to mutual funds, the terms "fixed-income," "bond," and "income" are synonymous. These terms denote funds that invest primarily in government and corporate debt. While fund holdings may appreciate in value, the primary objective of these funds is to provide a steady cash flow to investors. As such, the audience for these funds consists of conservative investors and retirees.        Bond funds are likely to pay higher returns than certificates of deposit and money market investments, but bond funds aren't without risk. Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on where they invest.Individual bonds may be the best known type of fixed income security, but the category also includes bond funds, ETFs, CDs, and money market funds.Fixed Income ETFsFixed income exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of fixed income investments that trade as a single unit throughout the day.    Money Market FundsA money market fund is a type of fixed income mutual fund that invests in debt securities that are characterized by their short maturities and minimal credit risk.For money market funds, income can be either taxable or tax exempt, depending on the types of securities in which the fund invests. These may include short-term U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency notes, Eurodollar deposits, repurchase agreements, certificates of deposit, corporate commercial paper; or obligations of states, cities, or other types of municipal agencies. Bond FundsBond funds are professionally managed portfolios that invest in individual fixed income securities.Reasons to consider bond funds Potential for capital preservation, depending on the fundIncome generationDiversification for a potential hedge against stock market volatilityLiquidityFunds are guided by a stated objective, generally focusing on a particular sector, such as corporate or Treasury bonds; a broad category, such as investment grade or high yield securities; or a specific time horizon, such as short-, intermediate-, or long-term bonds. Individual BondsA bond is an interest-bearing security that obligates the issuer to pay the bondholder a specified sum of money, usually at specific intervals (known as a coupon), and to repay the principal amount of the loan at maturity. Zero-coupon bonds pay both the imputed interest and the principal at maturity. Here are the top fixed investment picks you should consider:Baird Short-Term Bond FundThe fund has returned 1.50 percent over the past year, 1.48 percent over the past three years, 2.04 percent over the past five years, and 3.17 percent over the past decade. It is a low risk investment with low fees.·Metropolitan West Intermediate Bond FundThe fund has returned 1.59 percent over the past year, 1.63 percent over the past three years, 3.55 percent over the past five years, and 5.43 percent over the past decade. It is a low risk investment with low fees.Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-ExemptVanguard Fund gives you a low-risk muni option. The fund has a duration of 2.5 years and charges just 0.20%. Average credit quality is double-A. But the fund yields only 0.9% (that’s a tax-equivalent 1.6% for a taxpayer in the highest bracket. Fidelity Intermediate Municipal IncomeIf you’re investing in a taxable account, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better fund than Fidelity Intermediate Municipal Income (FLTMX). Munis, which pay interest that is generally free of federal income tax, typically offer a bit less volatility than taxable bonds with similar characteristics. The fund’s average duration is 5 years, and its average credit quality is a relatively safe single-A.Non-Public Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)These are not the traditional REITs that trade on an exchange. Public REITs are too volatile. Private REITs typically perform steadily and are currently providing mid to high single-digit dividends. Again, do your homework. Some are great, while others are atrocious or too new.Variable annuities with guaranteed income optionsVariable annuities are not necessarily great investments because they tend to act just like expensive mutual funds. The real value comes from the potential income benefit. Most variable annuities currently offer a 5 or 6 percent guaranteed income for the life of the owner. The beauty of that income is that if the market drives the account up, income can increase, but if the market drives the account down, the income remains constant. In retirement, that is very important.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
