Justin Renz, of Milton, with his patient partner, Cameron MacPhail of Braintree. 



Justin Renz will be in Hopkinton bright and early Monday morning, joining a field of 36,000  for the 118th running of the Boston Marathon. But the 42-year-old Milton resident has a unique storyline. Renz will be attempting to complete his third marathon in eight weeks, and his second in just eight days.

Last Sunday, Renz crossed the finish line at the London Marathon in 2 hours, 42 minutes, and 20 seconds, the third-fastest performance by an American male. Completing the London course also gave Renz a unique distinction: he has run all six of the world’s “majors” — London, Boston, Chicago, New York, Berlin, and Tokyo, which he completed in February with a time of 2:41:48.“Running Boston will be a challenge; I have never run two marathons in eight days,” said Renz, the chief financial officer of a biotechnology company in Cambridge.

After completing Boston for the ninth time last April in 2:41:56 — two-plus hours before the first bomb exploded near the finish line — he planned to skip this year’s race and focus on London, completing his circuit of the majors.
But within a few days, he made the decision that he would run both London and Boston.“I have three kids and they said ‘Dad, you can’t not run Boston this year,’ ” recalled Renz.

His wife, Jen, and their children — 9-year-old twins Annie and Jonah, and Will, 8 — will be at the 13.1-mile mark, in Wellesley, at the Children’s Hospital station. The past six years, Renz has run for Children’s, and his patient partner, Cameron MacPhail of Braintree.“It’s a lot of fun because we watch him and support him at most of his races,” said Jen Renz. “My kids are developing a positive experience out of being a part of the whole Children’s Hospital contingent. They have become friends with Cameron and his family.”Last week, wearing his Children’s Hospital singlet in London, Renz received a great deal of support for Boston.Monday, he is hoping to finish the course in less than three hours and “enjoy the magic that will occur after the tragedy of last year,” he said.In his six majors, he has averaged a 2:42 finish, the third-best performance to date. Since Toyko was added as the sixth major only a year ago, not every elite runner has had an opportunity to run all six. His best time: a 2:39:36, in Chicago, in 2012. 
 But he acknowledges that he is fortunate to still be on course.In 1997, while running Boston, he developed a severe blister on his left foot while breaking in a new pair of shoes. The foot became infected, and when Renz arrived at the emergency room a month later, he was told by doctors that he was roughly 48 hours away from having the foot amputated.Antibiotic injections were prescribed, but he was allergic to the initial dose. Four weeks later he was back in the emergency room after noticing blood in his urine. The allergic reaction had resulted in kidney failure and a condition known as rapidly progressing glumerulonephritis. His kidneys responded to medicine and returned to normal, but Renz gained 25 pounds after taking Prednisone, an immunosuppressant drug, for several years to control his condition.He jogged occasionally for eight years, but didn’t venture back to serious running until four days after Will was born in 2005. He ran a local 5K in Milton, which led to his return to marathoning in 2007, in Newport, R.I.“I ran a personal worst 3:07:39, but this was fast enough for me to qualify for Boston,” said Renz, a Connecticut native who ran cross-country at Holy Cross. “I wanted to be a fit dad and get back in shape for my kids.”In his return in 2008 — his first Hopkinton-to-Boston trek in 11 years, he ran a 3:04:02. He has completed every race since. “I’m looking forward to Monday. I think the crowds will be the biggest and best ever.”
Susan Collins
Last April, Susan Collins was stopped two miles from the finish line, near the Brookline-Boston border.“Nobody knew what was going on,” recalled Collins, the varsity girls’ lacrosse coach at Marshfield High.“On Beacon Street, I really got the sense that something was going on when emergency vehicles were passing us on the same side of the street we were running on. You never see that.“Almost every car that went by had white-jacketed (medical) people in it. The police made us move away from mailboxes because the bomb squad had not checked them. At that point I knew it was bad.”Collins walked to Route 9 to meet her family and drive home. “Fortunately, I was able to get out of the city pretty easily,” she said.She is eager to run Boston for the fifth time on Monday.“Last year was an awful day, yet I met some wonderful people,” said Collins, who has also run marathons in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.
Mark Maggi 

When Mark Maggi, a 30-year-old Cohasset resident, crossed the finish line in a personal-best time (2:42:25) last year, he had no intention of returning to Boston in 2014.“I ran a great race and I thought I would take a break for a couple of years,” said Maggi, an economist for the federal government. “I wasn’t anticipating coming back.”That all changed when he met friends and family at a post-race gathering in Newton, and turned to the television in disbelief as the tragic events at the finish line unfolded.He will run his fourth consecutive Boston as a gesture of solidarity.“I was a lucky one last year,” he said. “I ran a great race and was out of the city, but there is a whole group of people who had their finish line taken away from them.”Maggi, who bettered his personal best by more than five minutes last year, said the outpouring of support from the running community has been phenomenal.“I have friends who were done with marathons who have signed up for the race,” he said.“I know guys who are short distance runners who are coming to run. In the running community as a whole there is an overwhelming need to show that nothing will change.“This is one day of the year when there are no factions and it’s such a perfect day in Massachusetts. To have that tampered with last year made it personal.”
