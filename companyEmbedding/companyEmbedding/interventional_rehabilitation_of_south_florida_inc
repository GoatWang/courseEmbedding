Florida Pain Physicians
The impact that chronic pain has on over 50 million Americans is a concern
	 for all health care providers and a problem that is expected to grow as
	 advanced medicine allows for greater and greater longevity. Unfortunately,
	 chronic pain sufferers face many challenges including mediocre access
	 to care, lack of understanding of their diagnosis and drawn out treatments
	 with poor outcomes.
As interventional pain management physicians, Interventional Pain Physicians
	 of South Florida shares your goal of minimizing these obstacles in order
	 to provide the highest standard of care for patients with chronic pain.
	 Our doctors are board-certified in anesthesiology and pain management
	 and have been serving the South Florida, Central Florida and Northern
	 Florida areas for many years. In our practices, we are focused on: diagnosing
	 the source of pain; formulating comprehensive treatment plans; utilizing
	 the most advanced techniques available to attempt to eliminate pain; and,
	 when indicated, selectively using medication to control pain.

	We are pleased to say that, in an effort to effectively serve our community,
	 we have eighteen office locations and convenient hours including same
	 day or next day appointments. Our well-trained physicians, participation
	 with most major insurance carriers and utilization of advanced techniques
	 ensure that we can provide prompt, quality care for our patients. Our
	 ultimate goal is to provide relief from pain and allow patients to get
	 back to life! To find the doctor closest to you,
	call our Pain Information Line at 888-724-6565.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.

Patient Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between acute and chronic pain?
Acute pain is pain of a short, limited duration which is usually the result
	 of an injury, surgery or medical illness. Acute pain typically goes away
	 within the normal healing process. Chronic pain continues for longer periods
	 of time, and can be associated with frustration, depression and anxiety.
	 Treatments for acute and chronic pain often differ greatly.
What is interventional pain management?
Interventional pain management is the discipline of medicine devoted to
	 the diagnosis and treatment of pain related disorders with the application
	 of interventional techniques in managing subactue, chronic, persistent
	 and intractable pain, independently or in conjunction with other modalities.
Who are doctors specializing in pain management?
Pain specialists come from various primary specialties with advanced training
	 and expertise. They are mainly anesthesiologists, physical medicine &
	 rehabilitation specialists and neurologists. However, they may include
	 orthopedic surgeons and interventional radiologists with the proper training.
Can interventional pain management physicians find the cause of my pain?
While your pain specialist can not guarantee that they will be able to
	 find the underlying cause of your pain, they are highly trained in the
	 methods that would allow them to do so. They conduct a thorough physical
	 examination, review your medical records and analyze the description of
	 your pain. Many doctors review additional diagnostic studies such as x-rays,
	 CT scans, MRI's, nerve conductions studies and detailed history and
	 physical exam.
What are interventional pain management techniques?
Interventional pain management techniques are minimally invasive procedures
	 including, perctuaneous precision needle placement, with placement of
	 drugs in targeted areas or ablation of targeted nerves; and some surgical
	 techniques such as laser or endoscopic diskectomy, intrathecal infusion
	 pumps and spinal cord stimulators.
Are there psychological effects of chronic pain?
Yes. Chronic pain often produces feelings of anger, sadness, hopelessness
	 and even despair. In addition, it may alter one's personality, affect
	 their sleep patterns, interfere with work and have an effect on other
	 family members. It is normal to have psychological problems with pain.

                                1225044993
                            

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Organization
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.
                            



                                Provider Organization Name (Legal Business Name)

                                Provide organization name (legal business name used to file tax returns with the IRS). The Organization Name field allows the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, "at" sign, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon. A field cannot contain all special characters.

                                Other name by which the organization provider is or has been known.
