Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com

Memorial Production Partners Bankruptcy Analysis - Memorial Production Partners LP (NASDAQ:MEMP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Memorial Production Partners Bankruptcy AnalysisJan.23.17 | About: Memorial Production (MEMP) WYCO Researcher Special situations, research analyst, value, long/short equitySummaryUnit holders are getting 2% of the new equity and 5-year warrants to purchase 8% of the stock.Note holders are getting cash and 98% of the new stock.CODI tax liability and asset write-downs impact MEMP unit holders.Memorial is changing from a master limited partnership to a corporation when it exits Chapter 11. Memorial Production Partners LP (NASDAQ:MEMP) unitholders will receive 2% of the stock and 5-year warrants in a newly organized Memorial Parent NewCo (a corporation and not a master limited partnership). Holders of the two note issues will receive 98% and management could eventually get up to 10% of the new stock under an incentive plan according to the disclosure statement (docket 19). Distributions to equity holders is rare in bankruptcy, but valuing their recovery is complicated by very complex income tax issues. Reorganization Plan Memorial's master limited partnership business model of using hedging and bank borrowing leverage caused them to implode as energy prices dropped and the semi-annual determination base amount were decreased. This caused a cash crisis. They announced on December 23 that an agreement was reached for a in-court restructuring and they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 16. Under the pre-packaged plan, there is a very complex exchange of debt held by certain institutions that attempts to avoid transferability and marketability issues associated with the Securities Act of 1933 and to maximize tax deductions for holders of master limited partnership units. Holders of the notes will receive a pro rata share of $24.6 million cash and 98% of the new stock, subject to future dilution. Unit holders would receive a pro rata share of 2% of the new stock plus 5-year warrants to purchase 8% of the new stock at the claim amount of the unsecured noteholders, about $1.1 billion. It is very unusual for equity to receive an actual distribution under a reorganization plan when a higher priority class does not get full recovery. This is an actual distribution and not just some payment for releases. Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc (NYSE:BCEI) shareholders, for example, are getting paid for releases, but technically are not receiving a distribution under the bankruptcy reorganization plan. Under Section 1289 of the bankruptcy code, a plan is "fair and equitable" if the holder of any "claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property". Since a junior claim, equity unit holders, is receiving a very modest distribution, I wonder if a noteholder files an objection to the plan. (Note: In my opinion, I think the benefit of a very modest equity distribution to shareholders, which increases the liquidity and market interest for the new equity distributed to debt holders, is greater than the modest cost.) Current RBL lenders will participate in an exit credit facility that matures March 2021 with a rate of Libor+300-400. They will also receive the proceeds of closing all hedges, except $80 million of hedges will remain. Management will receive up to 10% of the stock under a long-term incentive plan. It does not seem that there is any immediate payment of equity to management on the emergence date. Disclosure Statement Financials Management's financial projections were based on December 30 NYMEX strip natural gas and oil prices. These base prices were then adjusted for the differentials to reflect the estimated prices actually received. Both natural gas and oil prices, however, have dropped since December 30, especially natural gas strip prices for 2017. 

 

 Valuations Perella Weinberg Partners (PWP) estimated the enterprise value to be $700 million-$900 million, which implies multiples of 4.9x-6.3x using 2018 unhedged EBITDA of $142.1 million. Using a multiple of 7x, the enterprise value would be $995 million. Since the estimated net debt is $445 million, PWP estimated equity value would be between $255 million and $455 million. Using a 7x multiple, the equity value would be $550 million. Not only is there a large variance from high and low for equity valuation, but it is a fairly highly leveraged capital structure. The two notes issues are trading around 45. That would imply a total equity valuation, prior to potential future dilution, of approximately $480 million. [There are about $1.1 billion in notes trading at 45 have a market value of $495 million. After deducting the $24.6 million cash distribution to noteholders, the value for the 98% equity distribution is about $470 million, which would indicate a $480 million total equity value ($470 million/0.98 = $480 million).] These values are prior to any future dilution from both the management incentive plan and warrants. The disclosure statement estimated recovery for note holders to be 22%-39%, which is based on PWP's equity estimates of $255 million-$455 million. The stated distribution to current equity holders is $6 million-$12 million. With almost 84 million units outstanding, that would be $0.07-$0.14 per unit. The 2% distribution of the new equity, estimated at $255 million-$455 million, works out to be $6 million-$10 million. Therefore, it seems they are valuing the 5-year warrants to purchase 8% of the stock at only $0.0-$2 million. Estimating the value of the warrants is almost impossible without knowing the future dividend policy. If no or very low dividends are paid, available money could be used for larger capital expenditures, which would increase the stock's value/price. That dividend policy would, therefore, increase the potential that the warrants would be in the money before they expire. Looking at the financial projections, it seems all cash-flow is used for paying down debt, interest, and capital expenditures. There does not seem to be any estimated future dividend payments. With an exercise price at over $1.1 billion, the new equity would have to more than double from PWP's highest estimated value to be in the money. Even using a 7x multiple on 2018 EBITDA for the equity value when it exits bankruptcy, the stock price would have to increase about 14% annually to be at about the exercise price. Time Table * February 27-- hearing to approve adequacy of disclosure statement * Within 90 days after the January 16 filing-- hearing to confirm the plan * Within 15 days after the confirmation hearing-- effective date and exit bankruptcy. Tax Issues Warning: It is extremely important to note that the following income tax information is merely a discussion of possible tax issues. It is not meant to be tax advice. Because there will be cancellation of debt and MEMP is taxed as a partnership, there will be cancellation of debt income (CODI) allocated to MEMP unit holders. (I am assuming it will be allocated to holders of record on the effective day for the plan.) The new entity will be a corporation and new shareholders will not face this problem in the future. Management tried to structure the plan so that there will also be a reduction in asset valuation that would enable unit holders to take this deduction. These two events are not directly offset. They will be reported as two different items - not a net item. The amount of the deduction for the lower asset valuation is limited to an individual investor's adjusted cost basis for their MEMP units. The CODI liability does not have a limit. I may write additional tax information in an InstaBlog based on questions and comments from readers posted below. Conclusion MEMP notes are not trading at a large discount from estimated fair value to justify their purchase. As usual during most bankruptcy proceedings, I would expect high volatility for the securities based on filed motions and hearings. Because of the CODI tax issues and that current price seems actually below estimated recovery, I recommend selling MEMP units. Those with very high adjusted cost basis for MEMP should consult with a qualified CPA to get detailed information for their own specific case to determine the tax impact when determining whether to hold or sell MEMP units.

Energy-Related ETFs or MLPs Losses? 


Did your broker recommend these energy-related top losing ETFs or MLPs?
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a fund that is traded on stock exchanges. An ETF has assets which could include stocks, commodities, or bonds, and trades close to the net asset value on the day it is traded. An ETF may be attractive to an investor because of low costs, tax benefits, and the same type of features as stocks.
A master limited partnership (MLP) is a publicly traded limited partnership which combines the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of public traded securities. Investors are paid through quarterly distributions.
Most of the following ETFs and MLPs have already lost significant market value since energy prices keep tumbling. They follow the fall in crude oil prices.
Linn Energy (LINE)
The United States Oil Fund (USO)
SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP)
Legacy Reserves (LGCY)
Memorial Production Partners (MEMP)
BreitBurn Energy Partners (BBEP)

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com
