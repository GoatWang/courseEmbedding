Ingredients Disclosure

Since 1986, PM USA has disclosed all of the ingredients added to tobacco in our cigarettes to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for products sold in the United States.




















​Information from the CDC:

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – Tobacco Ingredients & Nicotine Reporting

U.S.–grown tobacco is the primary ingredient in our premium tobacco products. 
We try to strike a reasonable balance between providing detailed information about the ingredients in our products while protecting our proprietary recipes from disclosure to competitors.  
On this webpage, you'll find lists of flavorings and other ingredients for Philip Morris USA's products sold in the U.S. You'll also find a list identifying ingredients at levels of 0.1% or more of the weight of the column of tobacco in each cigarette product, organized by brand name.  
 

Cigarette Tobacco & Flavor Ingredients 

This list includes ingredients in all of PM USA’s cigarette products. Not all of the ingredients in this list are present in each cigarette product, and no particular cigarette product contains all of the ingredients. 

For each ingredient, this alphabetical list includes: 


the "quantity not exceeded" (calculated from the highest level of use in a single cigarette and expressed as a percentage of the total weight of the tobacco); and
the function of the ingredient. 
We have chosen to provide a single list rather than a list for each cigarette product to avoid disclosing to our competitors the specific flavorings that give each cigarette product its own unique flavor, taste and aroma.

​Cigarette Non-Tobacco Ingredients
We have grouped the list of non-tobacco ingredients in all Philip Morris USA cigarette products in the following six categories: 
Cigarette papers
Side-seam adhesives
Monogram inks
Filtration materials
Filter papers (including plug wraps, tipping papers and tipping paper inks)
Filter adhesives 
We’ve listed the ingredients in descending order by weight. 
For each ingredient, the list includes the "quantity not exceeded," calculated from the highest level of use in a particular cigarette product and expressed as a percentage of the total weight of the cigarette.
