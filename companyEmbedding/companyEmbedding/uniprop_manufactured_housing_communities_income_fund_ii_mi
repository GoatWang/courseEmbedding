Our History.
Inception
Uniprop was founded in Birmingham, Michigan in 1974 as a diversified real estate equity investment firm. Initial equity capital was provided by individual “qualified investors”. The firm’s first investments were in office buildings, manufactured home communities, and other income producing properties.
In 1978, Paul Zlotoff, company chairman, conducted a strategic review of the company’s portfolio and identified manufactured housing as an attractive niche in the investment real estate market. Gradually, Uniprop shifted its focus to manufactured home communities.
Over the next several years, the company identified opportunistic acquisition opportunities and grew its portfolio to 40 manufactured home communities in twelve states, making it one of the largest privately held companies in the industry.
In the mid-1980’s, Paul Zlotoff purchased Uniprop and became Chairman. Uniprop maintained its business plan and over the next decade embarked on a disciplined growth and diversification strategy. The diversification was geographic and by asset class. As of today, the company owns and manages 45 properties in fourteen states. Property types include Class A general office, medical office, commercial land development, residential land development, and retail uses.
The total portfolio value is approximately $500 million with modest leverage. The principals maintain a substantial liquid net worth with minimal recourse obligations. Recurring property management fees fund all day-to-day operations. Thus, the company is not under any pressure to make new investments. This strong capital base has positioned Uniprop to take advantage of market opportunities.
Financing
To fund its growth, Uniprop expanded its sources of capital over the years. The company was the first to tap the CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) market for mortgages secured by land-lease manufactured home communities. Goldman Sachs was the lead underwriter. Uniprop currently has a borrowing and depository relationship with Comerica Bank and Bank of America, among others.
In the mid-1980’s, Uniprop pioneered equity capital formation for manufactured home communities through two publicly registered limited partnerships. First, the company raised $30 million in equity capital (Uniprop Manufactured Housing Income Fund I) with E F Hutton as Sales Agent for limited partnership interests sold to the public. Subsequently, Fund II was taken to the public market and raised $66 million in equity capital. SEC reports are available on the Uniprop web-site at www.uniprop.com. The investors in Fund I received a return of 100% of their initial capital and distributions for many years. The investors in Fund II have received a quarterly distribution every quarter since the inception of the Fund, and continue to receive a distribution. Investors in Fund II have also received a partial return of capital. Neither public fund has been involved in partner litigation or any SEC investigation, a rare achievement for a publicly registered real estate limited partnership.
Current Status
Uniprop continues to focus on its mission statement: “Best Practices, Best in Class.” The company focuses on its core operations in order to provide the highest level of customer service at the property level. This commitment includes continuous training, updated policy manuals, standard operating procedures, and independent monitoring of performance through objective assessments.
The current portfolio enjoys above-average rental rates and cash flow. While other companies were focused on growth, Uniprop “kept its powder dry” and focused on operations, as it would not overpay for acquisitions. As the market has self-corrected, as it always does, Uniprop is now seeking disciplined growth, which means paying a reasonable price for well-located assets in markets with strong underlying fundamentals.
The company currently employs twelve people at its main office and approximately one hundred employees across its fourteen-state footprint. The team includes industry executives with years of experience in property management, land development, construction and asset sales.
The Senior Management team is comprised of the following individuals:
Paul Zlotoff Chairman
Roger Zlotoff President
Several years ago, Uniprop created a captive Private Equity company under the
“Wingspan” moniker.
In short, Uniprop has forged a strong operating and real estate platform, along with a capital base that allows it to pursue high value acquisition opportunities.

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

September
30, 2010 (Unaudited)

 




1.



Basis of
Presentation:




 

The
accompanying unaudited 2010 financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they
do not include all of the information and notes required by
generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements.  In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been
included.  The balance sheet at December 31, 2009 has
been derived from the audited financial statements at that
date.  Operating results for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2010 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2010,
or for any other interim period.  For further
information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in the Partnership’s Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2009.

 

We have
evaluated subsequent events through the date of this filing. We do
not believe there are any material subsequent events which would
require further disclosure.

 




2.



Mortgage
Payable:




 

On August
29, 2008, the Partnership refinanced its existing mortgage note
payable and executed seven new mortgages payable in the amount of
$23,225,000 secured by the seven properties of the Partnership. To
pay off the prior mortgage balance of $25,277,523 and the costs of
refinancing, the Partnership transferred $2,735,555 from cash
reserves.  The mortgages are payable in monthly
installments of interest and principal through September
2033.  Interest on these notes is accrued at a fixed rate
of 6.625% for five years, at which time, the rate will reset to the
lender’s then prevailing market rate.  As of
September 30, 2010 the balance on these notes was
$22,446,696.

 

The
Partnership incurred $693,798 in financing costs as a result of the
refinancing which is being amortized over the life of the
loan.  This included a 1% fee payable to an affiliate of
the General Partner.

 

Future
maturities on the note payable for the next five years and
thereafter are as follows: remainder of 2010 - $104,720; 2011 -
$436,612; 2012 - $466,432; 2013 - $498,289; 2014 - $532,321; and
thereafter - $20,408,322.

ITEM

MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

 

Critical
Accounting Policies

 

See Part
II, Item 7 – Critical Accounting Policies, our consolidated
financial statements and related notes in Part IV, Item 15 of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009
filed with the SEC on March 22, 2010 for accounting policies and
related estimates we believe are the most critical to understanding
condensed consolidated financial statements, financial conditions
and results of operations and which require complex management
judgment and assumptions or involve uncertainties.  There
have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies
and estimates previously disclosed in that report.

 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

Partnership
liquidity is based, in part, upon its investment
strategy.  Upon acquisition, the Partnership anticipated
owning the properties for seven to ten years.   All
of the properties have been owned by the Partnership for more than
ten years.  The General Partner may elect to have the
Partnership own the properties for as long as, in the opinion of
the General Partner, it is in the best interest of the Partnership
to do so.

 

The
Partnership's capital resources consist primarily of its seven
manufactured home communities. On August 29, 2008, the Partnership
refinanced these properties with Stancorp Mortgage Investors, LLC
(the “Refinancing”) in the amount of $23,225,000
secured by the seven properties of the Partnership. To pay off the
prior mortgage balance of $25,277,523 and the costs of refinancing,
the Partnership transferred $2,735,555 from cash
reserves.  The mortgages are payable in monthly
installments of interest and principal through September
2033.  Interest on these notes are accrued at a fixed
rate of 6.625% for five years, at which time, the rate will reset
to the lenders then prevailing market rate.  As of
September 30, 2010 the balance on these notes was
$22,446,696.

 

The
Partnership incurred $693,798 in financing costs as a result of the
refinancing which is being amortized over the life of the
loan.  This included a 1% fee payable to an affiliate of
the General Partner.

 

As a
result of the Refinancing, all of the Partnership’s seven
properties are mortgaged. At the time of the Refinancing, the
aggregate principal amount due under the seven mortgage notes was
$23,225,000 and the aggregate fair market value of the
Partnership’s mortgaged properties was
