AbstractTo obtain a water-soluble β-D-glucan derivative cleanly and conveniently, a highly efficient mechanochemical method, planetary ball milling, was used to phosphorylate β-D-glucan isolated from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in solid state. Soluble β-D-glucan phosphate (GP) with a high degree of substitution (0.77–2.09) and an apparent PEAK molecular weight of 6.6–10.0 kDa was produced when β-D-glucan was co-milled with sodium hexametaphosphate at 139.5–186.0 rad/s for 12–20 min. The energy transferred was 3.03–11.98 KJ/g. The phosphorylation of GPs was demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 13C and 31P Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Three GP products with different degree of substitution (DS) and degree of polymerisation (DP) were able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells, among which GP-2 with a DS of 1.24 and DP of 30.5 exerted the highest immunostimulating activity. Our results indicate that mechanochemical processing is an efficient method for preparing water-soluble and biologically active GP with high DS.

Introductionβ-D-glucan, a major component of yeast cell walls, is known as a potent immunostimulant and has significant augmenting effects on host defence systems [1]. The target immune cells of β-D-glucan include macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, with macrophages being the principal target cells [2]. The binding of β-D-glucan to these cells triggers phagocytosis and stimulates the release of a cascade of cytokines from macrophages, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and various types of interleukins (ILs) [3]. Macrophages activated by cytokines secrete nitric oxide (NO), which is toxic to tumor cells and microorganisms [4]. Therefore, by enhancing the host immune function, β-D-glucan exhibits antimicrobial and antitumoral activities. A major obstacle to the clinical utilisation of β-D-glucan as a biological response modifier is its relative lack of solubility in aqueous media [5]. The application of insoluble β-D-glucans in clinical settings would cause significant adverse effects, such as hepatosplenomegaly, granuloma formation, microembolisation, inflammation, pain, and increased endotoxin sensitivity, when administered by parenteral routes [6], [7]. Therefore, the preparation of water-soluble β-D-glucans would be advantageous, as reported previously by Qin et al. [8].
To improve the water solubility of β-D-glucans, several methods have been developed. One type of method is the chemical modification of β-D-glucans via, for example, carboxymethylation [8]–[10], sulphation [11], and phosphation [5], [12]. Through chemical modification, hydrophilic groups are introduced into β-D-glucans and the water solubility of these β-D-glucans derivatives is improved. Although the polyelectrolyte formed through these modifications may have different biological properties compared to neutral β-D-glucans, some derivatives of β-D-glucans have been reported to exert high immunomodulatory activity. For example, the water soluble β-D-glucan phosphate can specifically bind to monocyte/macrophage cell lines, accelerate wound healing, and attenuate cardiac dysfunction [13], [14]. The water soluble β-D-glucan sulfate can activate macrophages, stimulate bone marrow, and exerts antitumor therapeutic activity [11], [15]. However, the degree of substitution (DS) and molecular weight influence the antitumor activities of the sulfated β-D-glucan [16]. The water soluble carboxymethylated β-D-glucan can exhibit mitogenic and antioxidative activity [17], [18]. Another type of method is the physical degradation of β-D-glucans, such as through ultrasonic depolymerisation [6]. However, the solubility of the weakly degraded β-D-glucans produced in this manner is not improved as greatly as they are by chemical modification. However, in almost all procedures used to chemically modify β-D-glucans, the reactions are commonly carried out in an organic solvent at elevated temperature under strongly acidic or alkali conditions; thus, the cost associated with solvent recycling and neutralisation and energy consumption are unavoidable. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a simple, clean, and efficient procedure for preparing water-soluble β-D-glucans derivatives.
“Mechanochemistry” offers opportunities for developing new and cleaner synthesis procedures with either no or only nominal amounts of added solvent [19]. Mechanochemistry refers to reactions, normally of solids, induced by the input of mechanical energy, such as by grinding in ball mills. During mechanochemical processing, some mechanical energy can be converted to internal energy in the milled solids, and thus, many metastable active sites can be generated, which facilitate the reaction of the solids with other reagents. Mechanochemistry has been applied in comprehensive fields, such as alloy and materials engineering and pharmacology [20], [21]. Recently, mechanochemical treatment was applied to induce morphological and structural development and to improve the physicochemical properties of some polysaccharides, including cellulose [22], [23], starch [24], and lignocelluloses [25]. A few reports have demonstrated that milled cellulose can react directly with co-milled reagents, such as acetic anhydride [26] and lauric acid [27], to produce cellulose derivatives, such as surface-acetylated cellulose powder and cellulose laurate, indicating mechanochemical processing as a prospective protocol for the solid-state modification of polysaccharides; however, the ball-milling process is typically time-consuming.
In the present study, to obtain a water-soluble β-D-glucan derivative cleanly and conveniently, highly efficient mechanochemical processing via planetary ball milling was applied to phosphorylate β-D-glucan isolated from brewer’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, within 20 min. The obtained β-D-glucan phosphate (GP) was able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated macrophages, including phagocytosis, production of cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, and secretion of NO.

Materials and Methods

Preparation of β-D-glucan phosphate
The mechanochemical preparation of β-D-glucan phosphate was performed in a planetary ball mill (XXM, Jiaxing, China) equipped with two jars (150 mL each). The insoluble β-D-glucan isolated from brewer’s yeast, S. cerevisiae, was provided by Shanghai Gecono Yeast Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The insoluble β-D-glucan particles contained 4% water, 1.5% protein, and 94% β-D-glucan among which about 80% was (1→3)-linked β-D-glucan and 20% was (1→6)-linked β-D-glucan. Before milling, β-D-glucan was mixed thoroughly with sodium hexametaphosphate at different weight ratios (1∶2, 1∶4, and 1∶6). Subsequently, 15 g of the mixture was added to one of the jars and milled with 150 g of balls (diameter = 3 mm) at a certain rotational speed (139.5 or 186.0 rad/s) for a certain time (12, 16, and 20 min). During the milling, the jars were cooled by a water bath. Then, the milled powder was dissolved in deionised water and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min to remove insoluble β-D-glucan. The supernatant was collected, dialysed against deionised water thoroughly to remove excess sodium hexametaphosphate until the elemental phosphorus could not be detected in the permeate of dialysis, and finally lyophilised to obtain the GP products at a maximal DS of 2.07. GPs with different DS could be easily produced by changing the rotational speed, milling time, and charge ratio.


Evaluation of water solubility
The milled powder of β-D-glucan-hexametaphosphate (2.0000 g) was dissolved in 25 mL of deionised water and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The carbohydrate content of the supernatant and that of the initial milled powder were determined by the anthrone-sulphuric acid method [28]. The water solubility of β-D-glucan phosphate was calculated by the carbohydrate content of the supernatant divided by the carbohydrate content of the original milled powder.


Determination of molecular weight by HPLC
The apparent molecular weight of β-D-glucan phosphate and native β-D-glucan (NG) was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters 1525, Waters, USA). Eight milligrams of lyophilised GP and NG powder was dissolved in 2.0 mL of distilled water and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), respectively, and passed through a 0.23-µm filter for HPLC analysis. HPLC was performed on two linked gel-filtration chromatographic columns of ultrahydrogel™ 500 (Waters, USA) (7.8×300 mm) eluted with 0.1 M NaNO3 at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min and detected by a refractive index detector. The PEAK molecular weight of GP was calculated by the calibration curve obtained by using various standard dextrans (Dextran T20, T40, T100, and T200).


Determination of the degree of substitution (DS) and degree of polymerisation (DP)
The DS of β-D-glucan phosphate was calculated by the content of elemental phosphorus according to the following formula [29], which yields the average number of phosphate groups on each glucose residue.
The amount of elemental phosphorus was detected by spectrophotometric method based on the formation of phosphomolybdate with added ammonium molybdate [30], using KH2PO4 as a standard. In this formula, P% is the percentage of phosphorus content of the β-D-glucan phosphate, 162 is the molar mass of the anhydroglucose unit, 3100 is the atomic weight of phosphorus multiplied by 100, and 102 is the molar mass of the phosphate substituent (−NaHPO3) subtracted by the molar mass of the substituted hydrogen atom (−H).
The degree of polymerisation (DP) of GP was calculated according to the formula:


Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
FTIR spectroscopic analysis of the native β-D-glucan and β-D-glucan phosphate was performed using a Nicolet Nexus 470 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Nicolet, USA) with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and a frequency range of 4000–400 cm−1; 32 scans were performed for each sample [31]. Each sample was mixed with KBr thoroughly in a 1∶100 ratio and then pressed into a small pellet measuring approximately 1 mm thick.


13C and 31P Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
13C and 31P NMR analysis of the native β-D-glucan NG and β-D-glucan phosphate GP was performed on an AVANCE-400 spectrometer (Bruker, Switzerland). Before analysis, NG and GP samples were dissolved in DMSO-d6 and D2O, respectively and lyophilised three times from their respective solvent to exchange deuterium. 13C NMR spectroscopy was performed at 400 MHz and 40°C with approximately 15000 scans. 31P NMR spectroscopy was performed at 161.97 MHz and 40°C with 64 scans. Similarly, 31P NMR analysis of the milled sodium hexametaphosphate was performed. Before analysis, sodium hexametaphosphate was milled alone by planetary ball miller and then dissolved in D2O and lyophilised three times from D2O to exchange deuterium.


Cell culture of murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line
The murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 10% foetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in a 96-well plate at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator [32]. RAW264.7 cells were harvested with a trypsin/EDTA solution (Gibco, USA). The cells were counted and plated into 96-well plates at 5×105 cells/mL. Viability was routinely >97%. Cells were incubated overnight prior to beginning experiments.


Cell proliferation of RAW264.7 cells
The effect of β-D-glucan phosphate on the viability of RAW264.7 cells was determined using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium] bromide (MTT) assay [32]. After pre-incubating RAW264.7 cells (5×105 cells/mL) for 12 h, β-D-glucan phosphate or native β-D-glucan (50, 100, or 500 µg/mL) or lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 µg/mL) were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 48 h. Twenty microlitres of the MTT stock solution (5 mg/mL) was then added to each well to attain a total reaction volume of 200 µL. After incubation for 4 h, the plate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were aspirated. The formazan crystals in each well were dissolved in 150 µL DMSO, and the absorbance at 570 nm was recorded on a Molecular Plus-384 ELISA reader (Molecular, USA). Three wells were used for each GP concentration, and three independent experiments were performed.


Neutral red uptake by RAW264.7 Cells
The ability of GP to improve the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells was determined by neutral red uptake analysis. After the pre-incubation of RAW264.7 cells (5×104 cells/mL) for 12 h, each β-D-glucan phosphate or native β-D-glucan (50, 100, or 500 µg/mL) or LPS (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 µg/mL) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 24 h. The supernatant was then removed from the plate. Two hundred microlitres of fresh medium containing 0.01% neutral red was added into each well, and the cells were cultured for an additional 1 h. After 1 h, the cell plate was washed three times with PBS, and 200 µL of cell lysis buffer (acetic acid/ethanol; 1∶1) was added into each well, which was then kept at 4°C overnight [33]. The absorbance at 540 nm was detected using a Molecular Plus-384 ELISA reader.


Determination of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) production and NO secretion in RAW264.7 cells
The ability of GP to induce cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) production and NO secretion in RAW264.7 cells was determined using a commercial ELISA kit and Griess assay, respectively. After pre-incubating RAW264.7 cells (5×105 cells/mL) for 12 h, each β-D-glucan phosphate or native β-D-glucan (50, 100, or 500 µg/mL) or LPS (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 µg/mL) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 48 h. The concentration of TNF-α and IL-6 in culture supernatants was determined using an ELISA kit (eBioscience, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The NO content of the culture supernatants was measured by adding 50 µL of Griess reagent (1% sulphanilamide and 0.1% N-[1-naphthyl]-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 2.5% phosphoric acid) to 50-µL samples. The NO concentration was determined at 540 nm using NaNO2 as a standard [32].


Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as the means ± SD. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for data analysis using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) (10.0) software. Significant differences were indicated at p<0.05, whereas highly significant differences were indicated at p<0.01.


Results

Preparation of GP by planetary ball milling
The β-D-glucan particles isolated from S. cerevisiae were insoluble in water and weakly dissolved in DMSO [11]. After milling, the apparent PEAK molecular weight of all of the GPs prepared decreased greatly to 6.6–10.0 kDa (Table 1), much lower than that of the initial β-D-glucan material (430 kDa) (Fig. 1). Meanwhile, the water solubility and DS of each GP sample were also different, in accordance with the operating conditions (Table 1). Among the three operation parameters, the rotational speed of ball milling affected the water solubility of the GP products to the greatest extent, likely due to the different mechanical forces acting on the materials. The water solubility of GP-2 (78%) prepared at a rotational speed of 186.0 rad/s was much higher than that of GP-1 (54%) prepared at a speed of 139.5 rad/s (Table 1). Therefore, the ball-milling process was performed at a rotational speed of 186.0 rad/s in the following experiments.

              Table 1.  β-D-glucan phosphates prepared under different operation conditions.
              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103494.t001As the milling time increased from 12 min to 20 min, the water solubility of the GP products increased slightly, from 78% for GP-2 to 85% for GP-3 and 84% for GP-4, whereas the DS of the GP products increased significantly, from 1.24 for GP-2 to 2.09 for GP-4 (Table 1), indicating that the milling time has a significant impact on the efficiency of the phosphorylation reaction. Meanwhile, the DP of the GP products decreased from 30.5 for GP-2 to 17.6 for GP-4. In addition, the charge ratio of β-D-glucan to sodium hexametaphosphate also affects the phosphorylation of β-D-glucan. When β-D-glucan was co-milled with sodium hexametaphosphate at weight ratios of 1∶2, 1∶4, and 1∶6, respectively, at a rotational speed of 186.0 rad/s for 20 min, the DS of the GP products reached 0.77, 2.09, and 1.95, respectively, whereas the DP of the GP products decreased to 33.7, 17.6, and 26.0, respectively (Table 1), indicating that 1∶4 is a suitable charge ratio for producing GP with a much higher DS. Meanwhile, the polysaccharide yield after this phosphorylation process was about 70%, with the yield during the milling process 100% and that during the subsequent dialysing process 70%. Therefore, when operating under suitable conditions, soluble GP with a lower molecular weight and high DS could be successfully synthesised by the proposed mechanochemical method.


Energy transferred during the milling process
To estimate the amount of energy transferred to synthesised materials via milling and to reveal the mechanochemical mechanism underlying this process, several methods have been employed to model the dynamics of planetary ball milling, such as the particle element method, the use of analytical/numerical models, and the discrete element method [21]. Among the various models, the one described by Magini and coworkers has been well accepted [22]. The following equation was deduced from this model to calculate the power P* transferred to a unit mass of milled powder [34]. The values predicted by this equation show good agreement with experimental observations made with respect to milling ball motion and energy transfer.
According to the above equation, the energy transferred to a milled powder depends on the number of balls (Nb), the angular velocity of the vial (ωv) and plate (ωp), the geometrical parameters of the planetary ball-milling machine (Rv, Rp, and db), and the milling time (t). In our experiment, the weight of the powder PW = 15 g; the number of milling balls Nb = 1935; the weight of one ball mb = 7.80×10−5 kg; the milling time t = 720, 960, or 1200 s; the angular velocity of the plate ωp = 117.00 or 87.75 rad/s; the angular velocity of the vial ωv = 186.00 or 139.50 rad/s; the distance from the centre of the plate to the centre of the vial Rp = 5.20×10−2 m; the radius of the vial Rv = 3.50×10−2 m; the diameter of the milling balls db = 3.00×10−3 m; and the empirical factor related to the degree of filling of the vial φb = 0.87. Among these parameters, the angular velocity and milling time are the two most important variables, with the former affecting the transferred energy and the resulting mechanochemical reaction more greatly than the latter.
When milling for 12 min, the transferred power P* increased from a value of 3.03 KJ/g for a rotational speed (i.e., ωv) of 139.50 rad/s to 7.19 KJ/g for a rotational speed of 186.00 rad/s (Table 1). Accordingly, the water solubility of the corresponding GP product increased significantly. When the rotational speed was set to 186.00 rad/s, the transferred power P* increased linearly from 7.19 KJ/g for a milling time of 12 min to 11.98 KJ/g for a milling time of 20 min. Although the water solubility of three corresponding GP products was similar (approximately 80%), the DS of these GPs increased from 1.24 to 2.09, whereas the DP of these GPs decreased from 30.5 to 17.6, indicating that through varying the energy to some extent, GP products with different DS and DP could be produced and the energy provided by the planetary ball-milling machine was sufficient to induce the phosphorylation reaction between β-D-glucan and sodium hexametaphosphate as well as depolymerisation of β-D-glucan. However, although the energy transferred to GP-4, GP-5, and GP-6 was same, the DS of these three GPs varied significantly, indicating that besides the energy, other factors such as charge ratio would also influence the efficiency of phosphorylation reaction.


Chemical characterisation of GP
The structural changes in GP were monitored by FTIR as well as 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra of the initial insoluble β-D-glucan particles NG and the soluble derivatives GP-2 and GP-4 are compared in Fig. 2. The spectrum of untreated β-D-glucan is identical to that of β-D-glucan reported elsewhere [35], with the strong peak at 3430 cm−1 attributed to O–H stretching, the peak at 2923 cm−1 attributed to C–H stretching, and a peak at 1632 cm−1 attributed to the bending of bound water molecules. Two new peaks appeared in the spectra of GP-2 and GP-4: a strong peak at 1268 or 1271 cm−1 corresponding to the P = O bond and a slightly weaker peak at 893 or 889 cm−1 corresponding to the P–O bond, indicating that mechanochemical phosphorylation between β-D-glucan and sodium hexametaphosphate occurred during planetary ball milling.

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103494.g002The 13C NMR spectrum of the initial insoluble β-D-glucan particles NG in DMSO-d6 (Fig. 3) is identical to those of S. cerevisiae β-D-glucans reported elsewhere [5], [36]–[38]. The initial insoluble β-D-glucan contains β-(1→3)- and β-(1→6)-linked D-glucosyl units, the former component being the predominant one. The 13C NMR spectrum of NG contains the signals corresponding to the carbon atoms of both types of units (Fig. 3). The main peaks at 103.0, 86.2, 76.3, 72.8, 68.4, and 60.9 ppm are assigned to the C1, C3, C5, C2, C4, and C6 of β-(1→3)-linked D-glucosyl units [5], [36], [37]. While the small peaks at 103.3, 76.5, 75.8, 73.2, 69.8, and 68.1 ppm can be attributed to the C1, C3, C5, C2, C4, and C6 of β-(1→6)-linked D-glucosyl units [36], [38]. The 13C NMR spectrum of the soluble β-D-glucan phosphate GP-2 (DS 1.24) in D2O showed the presence of new peaks (Fig. 3). The main peaks at 102.9, 84.9, 76.1, 71.7/72.0, 68.6, and 61.2/61.0 ppm are assigned to the original C1, C3, C5, C2, C4, and C6 of β-(1→3)-linked D-glucosyl units. While the small peaks at 103.3, 77.7, 75.4, 73.2, and 69.3 ppm can be attributed to the original C1, C3, C5, C2, and C4 of β-(1→6)-linked D-glucosyl units. A strong new peak appeared at 73.6/73.7 ppm in GP-2 is assigned to the substituted C2 (marked as C2s), whereas a small new peak at 70.1/69.9 ppm is designated as the signal of weakly substituted C4 (marked as C4s), because the chemical shift of substituted carbon will move into downfield and partial substitution will widen the peaks of substituted carbon [39]. This is similar to those observed in sulfated derivatives of (1→3)-β-D-glucan with DS of 1.14–1.74 [40] and sulfated derivative of α-(1→3)-D-glucan with DS of 1.4 [41], although the downfield shift of a carbon atom linked by a sulfate group there is 7–10 ppm and here by a phosphate group is about 2 ppm. Moreover, a new peak at 100.1 ppm can be assigned to C1 (marked as C1′) because C2 was substituted and thus influenced the chemical shift of the adjacent C1 [39]. Therefore, phosphate groups have been chemically bound to β-D-glucan.

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103494.g003Further, 31P NMR spectral analysis of the initial insoluble β-D-glucan particles NG in DMSO-d6 and the soluble derivative GP-2 in D2O was undertaken to confirm the presence of the phosphate group in GP product. No signal was observed in NG, whereas a strong phosphorus signal was observed at 2.69 ppm in GP-2 (Fig. 4), similar with previously reported β-D-glucan phosphate [5], [42] as well as phosphated (1→3)-α-D-glucan [43], confirming that phosphate groups were bound to the molecular chain. In addition, two small signals were observed at –7.44 and –18.75 ppm, suggesting that other types of phosphate group were present in the phosphated β-D-glucan derivative, perhaps being minor portions of polysaccharide diphosphates and oligophosphates, as reported in starch phosphates [30]. This was further demonstrated by a weak signal at –9.87 ppm and a strong signal at –21.66 ppm observed in 31P NMR spectrum of sodium hexametaphosphate milled alone [milled (NaPO3)6] (Fig. 4). Therefore, in view of the 13C and 31P NMR results, phosphate groups have been chemically bound to β-D-glucan.

Immunostimulating properties of GP on macrophage RAW264.7 cells
Macrophages play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity and are considered the main target cells of β-D-glucans. Macrophages act as the first line of immune defence by phagocytosing environmental particles and pathogens, recruiting and activating inflammatory cells, and producing a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators, such as TNF-α, ILs, and NO, to regulate their own activity and the activity of other immune cells [44]. To examine whether the mechanochemically produced GP was able to stimulate the functional activation of macrophages, murine macrophage cells of the line RAW264.7 were incubated with 50–500 µg/mL of GP product or native β-D-glucan, and cell proliferation, neutral red uptake, cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) production, and NO secretion were measured and compared to the amount produced by the untreated control group. Three GP products with different DS and DP, i.e., GP-2 with a DS of 1.24 and DP of 30.5, GP-4 with a DS of 2.09 and DP of 17.6, and GP-5 with a DS of 0.77 and DP of 33.7, were measured.


Effect of GP on the proliferation of macrophage RAW264.7
First, the cytotoxic effect or proliferation effect of three GP products on RAW264.7 cells was examined. The MTT assay indicated that GP-2, GP-4, and GP-5 as well as NG and LPS enhanced the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, among which GP-2 exerted the most significant proliferation enhancement effect (114%, 121%, and 127% at concentrations of 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL), which was nearly same with the native β-D-glucan (Fig. 5A). GP-4 and GP-5 only enhanced the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells significantly at 500 µg/mL (p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively).

RAW264.7 cells were treated with NG or GP (50, 100, and 500 µg/mL) or LPS (10, 100, and 1000 ng/mL) in different concentrations as described in the Materials and Methods.After incubation, the viability of RAW264.7 cells was measured by an MTT assay, and the A570 value was recorded, whereas the amount of neutral red uptake was detected by the A540 value. The data represent the means ± SD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared with control. Each point represents the average of three independent experiments.

Effect of GP on the phagocytosis capacity of RAW264.7 cells
The amount of neutral red uptake by macrophages was measured to analyse the phagocytic ability of RAW264.7 cells incubated with GP products and native β-D-glucan. The phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells increased significantly after being stimulated by a higher concentration (500 µg/mL) of GP-2, GP-4, and GP-5, with GP-2 inducing the greatest extent of phagocytosis (161%), which was equal to that stimulated by 1 µg/mL of LPS (Fig. 5B). However, a lower concentration of GP-4 also significantly stimulated the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells (50 µg/mL, p<0.01; 100 µg/mL, p<0.05), whereas a lower concentration of GP-2 and GP-5 did not. But the native β-D-glucan could stimulate the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells at each concentration, in a concentration-dependent manner.


Effect of GP on the TNF-α and IL-6 production and NO secretion of RAW264.7 cells
Finally, the secretion of two major cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, as well as a major inflammatory mediator, NO, by RAW264.7 cells incubated with GP was measured. TNF-α is an important host defence molecule that affects tumor cells. All three GP products and NG, as well as the positive control LPS, significantly stimulated TNF-α production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). The TNF-α production induced by GP-2 was much higher than that induced by GP-4 and GP-5, and also obviously higher that induced by NG. After being stimulated with 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL of GP-2 for 48 h, TNF-α production in the culture supernatant increased to 6.3-, 7.2-, and 13.1-fold that of the control, respectively. However, GP-4 and GP-5 stimulated TNF-α production significantly only at a concentration of 100–500 µg/mL (p<0.01), inducing a level of production 1.4–3.6- and 1.4–3.1-fold that of the control.

After incubation, the TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations in the supernatant were detected using commercial kits. The data represent the means ± SD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared with control. Each point represents the average of three independent experiments.

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103494.g006IL-6 is a major cytokine involved in B cell differentiation, T cell activation, induction of acute phase proteins, and reduction of the G0-residence time of hematopoietic cells. NG, GP-2, and GP-4, as well as LPS, induced IL-6 secretion in RAW264.7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with GP-2 stimulating a higher level of secretion than GP-4 and a lower level of secretion than NG, whereas GP-5 suppressed IL-6 secretion (Fig. 6B). After being stimulated with 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL of GP-2, IL-6 production in the culture supernatant increased significantly to 2.6-, 4.5-, and 14.9-fold that of the control, respectively. GP-4 only induced the secretion of IL-6 significantly at a concentration of 500 µg/mL (p<0.05).
NO is a major mediator of macrophages that acts as a destroyer to bacteria and tumor cells. A Griess assay indicated that all three GP productss and native β-D-glucan, as well as LPS, induced secretion of NO significantly in a concentration-dependent manner, with GP-2 triggering the highest level of NO secretion and GP-5 the lowest among the three GPs, whereas NG similar with GP-2 (Fig. 7). After being stimulated with 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL of GP-2, the concentration of NO in the culture supernatant increased to 4.8-, 50-, and 5.7-fold that of the control, respectively. After being stimulated with 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL of GP-4, the amount of NO secreted increased to 1.7-, 3.0-, and 4.9-fold that of the control, respectively. On the other hand, GP-5 only triggered NO secretion significantly at concentrations of 100 and 500 µg/mL (p<0.01). Therefore, among the three GP products, GP-2 with a DS of 1.24 and DP of 30.5 exhibited the strongest immunostimulating activity and was nearly similar with NG.

DiscussionThe application of an environmentally friendly, solvent-free, and convenient method, mechanochemical processing, to phosphorylate and solubilise β-D-glucan isolated from brewer’s yeast, S. cerevisiae, was investigated in this study. Water-soluble β-D-glucan derivatives, β-D-glucan phosphates, with a greatly reduced apparent PEAK molecular weight of 6.6–10.0 kDa and high DS of 0.77–2.09 as well as greatly decreased DP of 17.6–33.7 were successfully prepared by planetary ball milling (Table 1). The result indicated that the tight helical structure of β-D-glucan molecules could be broken and activated to react with sodium hexametaphosphate by mechanical force. Moreover, the phosphorylation efficiency of the planetary ball-milling process was very high because the reaction could be completed within 20 min, indicating that mechanical energy was effectively transformed into the internal energy of the milled materials. This transformed energy could improve the chemical reactivity of the hydroxyl groups of β-D-glucan molecule and increase the number of metastable active sites, with which the sodium hexametaphosphate could rapidly react. When the insoluble β-D-glucan was depolymerised and modified with the hydrophilic phosphate groups by this process, its water solubility improved significantly. Most importantly, compared to the traditional phosphorylation process of β-D-glucan, which is carried out in an organic solvent at elevated temperature [5], our process is convenient, clean, solvent-free, and easy to implement. The phosphorylation reaction could be performed by a one-step process. Therefore, it may be favourable for environmental and industrial application.
The presence of phosphate groups in the GP products was demonstrated by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 2) as well as 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 3 and 4). The obtained GP products were biologically active and able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated macrophage cells of the RAW264.7 line, such as cell proliferation, phagocytosis, cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) production, and NO secretion (Fig. 5–7), especially TNF-α production and NO secretion, with GP-2 (DS = 1.24, DP = 30.5) exerting the highest immunostimulating activity, which was similar with the native β-D-glucan.
However, according to previous reports, the immunity-modulating activity of yeast β-D-glucans depends on the molecular weight, glycosidic linkages, and chemical groups attached to the main chain. Phosphated β-D-glucan with a DS of 0.14 prepared by traditional chemical modification in an organic solvent has been reported to exert immunity-modulating activity [13], [14]. β-D-glucan sulfate with a DS of 1.14 and molecular weight of 46 kDa has been reported to exhibit the highest anti-tumor activity among several sulfated derivatives [16]. Carboxymethylated β-D-glucan derivative with DS of 0.75 showed the highest mitogenic activity, while derivatives with DS higher than 1.0 were inactive [17]. These researches demonstrate that the appropriate DS and chemical group influences the activity of β-D-glucan. In this study, a comparison of GP products with the similar apparent PEAK molecular weight (6.6–10.0 kDa) and various DS and DP demonstrated that GP-2 with a DS of 1.24 and DP of 30.5 exerted higher biological activity than GP-4 with a higher DS (2.09) and lower DP (17.6) and GP-5 with a lower DS (0.77) and higher DP (33.7) (Fig. 5–7), suggesting that the appropriate DS of phosphate groups and the appropriate DP of β-D-glucan are the two main determinants of immune cell stimulation. Meanwhile, the biological properties of GP-2 were similar with those of the initial β-D-glucan particles, among which the TNF-α secretion of RAW264.7 cells stimulated by GP-2 were even a little higher than that by native β-D-glucan. The reason for the different immunostimulating activities of these GP products will be researched further.
In conclusion, mechanochemical processing can be used as a simple, efficient, and clean method to produce biologically active GP, which may be attractive for industrial application.

					Do they really do anything?  My guess is that you couldn't tell the difference between putting your mattress on box springs or a stone slab.

					Some warranties of really really nice mattresses will be voided if you don't use one.   It's all about money.    As for functionality, ya I am sure it provides slightly more cushion than a stone slab, but i guess it depends how thick your mattress is, materials, etc.

					A stone slab is okay too. They just dont want you putting it on no support at all (ex no slats or slab underneath).

					I think it is just to spread the weight evenly across the bed frame.

Basically it is for the fatties. Or your pear shaped wife.

And mattress sets are too fucking expensive!  My wife tried to talk me into getting the 5k set and I laughed her all the way out of the store.

					A box spring has some give and you would notice the difference. A foundation is just a box you set the mattress on.

Box spring.

Foundation

					We have memory foam at home and you can really tell the difference when fucking on a hotel bed with springs, while traveling.

Bounce it... 



Made better by the fact that the college pays for the hotel room.

					if i didnt have a box spring, then the mattress would break the bed frame since it's tiny sticks of wood across the middle.

					I have box springs at the moment, but I've found equal support both for the mattress on either a plywood sheet or a simple bed box.  I don't think it matters.

					My bed is just below my hip in height.  The 14" bed frame I bought is awesome.  Tons of storage under the bed.

					Box spring gives you something to tuck your sheets into. It lets your comforter hang. It just makes things look finished and neat.

Cookies When you’re craving cookies, make sure you have some on hand. Amazon.com offers a wide range of cookies, including shortbread, oatmeal, peanut butter, chocolate chip, sugar, gluten-free, sandwich cookies, and variety packs. If you can’t resist the creamy center inside of an Oreo, we have several flavors to choose from. If you’re looking for a certain type of Milano or a favorite Kashi cookie, we have those, too. Prefer something simpler? Try our butter cookies, biscotti, or fortune cookies. Let Amazon.com help you satisfy your sweet tooth.

To obtain a water-soluble β-D-glucan derivative cleanly and conveniently, a highly efficient mechanochemical method, planetary ball milling, was used to phosphorylate β-D-glucan isolated from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in solid state. Soluble β-D-glucan phosphate (GP) with a high degree of substitution (0.77-2.09) and an apparent PEAK molecular weight of 6.6-10.0 kDa was produced when β-D-glucan was co-milled with sodium hexametaphosphate at 139.5-186.0 rad/s for 12-20 min. The energy transferred was 3.03-11.98 KJ/g. The phosphorylation of GPs was demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 13C and 31P Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Three GP products with different degree of substitution (DS) and degree of polymerisation (DP) were able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells, among which GP-2 with a DS of 1.24 and DP of 30.5 exerted the highest immunostimulating activity. Our results indicate that mechanochemical processing is an efficient method for preparing water-soluble and biologically active GP with high DS.











Mechanochemical phosphorylation and solubilisation of β-D-glucan from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its biological activities.

Soluble β-D-glucan phosphate (GP) with a high degree of substitution (0.77–2.09) and an apparent PEAK molecular weight of 6.6–10.0 kDa was produced when β-D-glucan was co-milled with sodium hexametaphosphate at 139.5–186.0 rad/s for 12–20 min. The energy transferred was 3.03–11.98 KJ/g. The phosphorylation of GPs was demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 13C and 31P Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Three GP products with different degree of substitution (DS) and degree of polymerisation (DP) were able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells, among which GP-2 with a DS of 1.24 and DP of 30.5 exerted the highest immunostimulating activity. Our results indicate that mechanochemical processing is an efficient method for preparing water-soluble and biologically active GP with high DS.Introductionβ-D-glucan, a major component of yeast cell walls, is known as a potent immunostimulant and has significant augmenting effects on host defence systems [1]. The target immune cells of β-D-glucan include macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, with macrophages being the principal target cells [2]. The binding of β-D-glucan to these cells triggers phagocytosis and stimulates the release of a cascade of cytokines from macrophages, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and various types of interleukins (ILs) [3]. Macrophages activated by cytokines secrete nitric oxide (NO), which is toxic to tumor cells and microorganisms [4]. Therefore, by enhancing the host immune function, β-D-glucan exhibits antimicrobial and antitumoral activities. A major obstacle to the clinical utilisation of β-D-glucan as a biological response modifier is its relative lack of solubility in aqueous media [5]. The application of insoluble β-D-glucans in clinical settings would cause significant adverse effects, such as hepatosplenomegaly, granuloma formation, microembolisation, inflammation, pain, and increased endotoxin sensitivity, when administered by parenteral routes [6], [7]. Therefore, the preparation of water-soluble β-D-glucans would be advantageous, as reported previously by Qin et al. [8].To improve the water solubility of β-D-glucans, several methods have been developed. One type of method is the chemical modification of β-D-glucans via, for example, carboxymethylation [8]–[10], sulphation [11], and phosphation [5], [12]. Through chemical modification, hydrophilic groups are introduced into β-D-glucans and the water solubility of these β-D-glucans derivatives is improved. Although the polyelectrolyte formed through these modifications may have different biological properties compared to neutral β-D-glucans, some derivatives of β-D-glucans have been reported to exert high immunomodulatory activity. For example, the water soluble β-D-glucan phosphate can specifically bind to monocyte/macrophage cell lines, accelerate wound healing, and attenuate cardiac dysfunction [13], [14]. The water soluble β-D-glucan sulfate can activate macrophages, stimulate bone marrow, and exerts antitumor therapeutic activity [11], [15]. However, the degree of substitution (DS) and molecular weight influence the antitumor activities of the sulfated β-D-glucan [16]. The water soluble carboxymethylated β-D-glucan can exhibit mitogenic and antioxidative activity [17], [18]. Another type of method is the physical degradation of β-D-glucans, such as through ultrasonic depolymerisation [6]. However, the solubility of the weakly degraded β-D-glucans produced in this manner is not improved as greatly as they are by chemical modification. However, in almost all procedures used to chemically modify β-D-glucans, the reactions are commonly carried out in an organic solvent at elevated temperature under strongly acidic or alkali conditions; thus, the cost associated with solvent recycling and neutralisation and energy consumption are unavoidable. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a simple, clean, and efficient procedure for preparing water-soluble β-D-glucans derivatives.“Mechanochemistry” offers opportunities for developing new and cleaner synthesis procedures with either no or only nominal amounts of added solvent [19]. Mechanochemistry refers to reactions, normally of solids, induced by the input of mechanical energy, such as by grinding in ball mills. During mechanochemical processing, some mechanical energy can be converted to internal energy in the milled solids, and thus, many metastable active sites can be generated, which facilitate the reaction of the solids with other reagents. Mechanochemistry has been applied in comprehensive fields, such as alloy and materials engineering and pharmacology [20], [21]. Recently, mechanochemical treatment was applied to induce morphological and structural development and to improve the physicochemical properties of some polysaccharides, including cellulose [22], [23], starch [24], and lignocelluloses [25]. A few reports have demonstrated that milled cellulose can react directly with co-milled reagents, such as acetic anhydride [26] and lauric acid [27], to produce cellulose derivatives, such as surface-acetylated cellulose powder and cellulose laurate, indicating mechanochemical processing as a prospective protocol for the solid-state modification of polysaccharides; however, the ball-milling process is typically time-consuming.In the present study, to obtain a water-soluble β-D-glucan derivative cleanly and conveniently, highly efficient mechanochemical processing via planetary ball milling was applied to phosphorylate β-D-glucan isolated from brewer’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, within 20 min. The obtained β-D-glucan phosphate (GP) was able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated macrophages, including phagocytosis, production of cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, and secretion of NO.Materials and MethodsPreparation of β-D-glucan phosphateThe mechanochemical preparation of β-D-glucan phosphate was performed in a planetary ball mill (XXM, Jiaxing, China) equipped with two jars (150 mL each). The insoluble β-D-glucan isolated from brewer’s yeast, S. cerevisiae, was provided by Shanghai Gecono Yeast Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The insoluble β-D-glucan particles contained 4% water, 1.5% protein, and 94% β-D-glucan among which about 80% was (1→3)-linked β-D-glucan and 20% was (1→6)-linked β-D-glucan. Before milling, β-D-glucan was mixed thoroughly with sodium hexametaphosphate at different weight ratios (12, 14, and 16). Subsequently, 15 g of the mixture was added to one of the jars and milled with 150 g of balls (diameter=3 mm) at a certain rotational speed (139.5 or 186.0 rad/s) for a certain time (12, 16, and 20 min). During the milling, the jars were cooled by a water bath. Then, the milled powder was dissolved in deionised water and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min to remove insoluble β-D-glucan. The supernatant was collected, dialysed against deionised water thoroughly to remove excess sodium hexametaphosphate until the elemental phosphorus could not be detected in the permeate of dialysis, and finally lyophilised to obtain the GP products at a maximal DS of 2.07. GPs with different DS could be easily produced by changing the rotational speed, milling time, and charge ratio.Evaluation of water solubilityThe milled powder of β-D-glucan-hexametaphosphate (2.0000 g) was dissolved in 25 mL of deionised water and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The carbohydrate content of the supernatant and that of the initial milled powder were determined by the anthrone-sulphuric acid method [28]. The water solubility of β-D-glucan phosphate was calculated by the carbohydrate content of the supernatant divided by the carbohydrate content of the original milled powder.Determination of molecular weight by HPLCThe apparent molecular weight of β-D-glucan phosphate and native β-D-glucan (NG) was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters 1525, Waters, USA). Eight milligrams of lyophilised GP and NG powder was dissolved in 2.0 mL of distilled water and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), respectively, and passed through a 0.23-µm filter for HPLC analysis. HPLC was performed on two linked gel-filtration chromatographic columns of ultrahydrogel™ 500 (Waters, USA) (7.8×300 mm) eluted with 0.1 M NaNO3 at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min and detected by a refractive index detector. The PEAK molecular weight of GP was calculated by the calibration curve obtained by using various standard dextrans (Dextran T20, T40, T100, and T200).Determination of the degree of substitution (DS) and degree of polymerisation (DP)The DS of β-D-glucan phosphate was calculated by the content of elemental phosphorus according to the following formula [29], which yields the average number of phosphate groups on each glucose residue.The amount of elemental phosphorus was detected by spectrophotometric method based on the formation of phosphomolybdate with added ammonium molybdate [30], using KH2PO4 as a standard. In this formula, P% is the percentage of phosphorus content of the β-D-glucan phosphate, 162 is the molar mass of the anhydroglucose unit, 3100 is the atomic weight of phosphorus multiplied by 100, and 102 is the molar mass of the phosphate substituent (−NaHPO3) subtracted by the molar mass of the substituted hydrogen atom (−H).The degree of polymerisation (DP) of GP was calculated according to the formula:Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopyFTIR spectroscopic analysis of the native β-D-glucan and β-D-glucan phosphate was performed using a Nicolet Nexus 470 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Nicolet, USA) with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and a frequency range of 4000–400 cm−1; 32 scans were performed for each sample [31]. Each sample was mixed with KBr thoroughly in a 1100 ratio and then pressed into a small pellet measuring approximately 1 mm thick.13C and 31P Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy13C and 31P NMR analysis of the native β-D-glucan NG and β-D-glucan phosphate GP was performed on an AVANCE-400 spectrometer (Bruker, Switzerland). Before analysis, NG and GP samples were dissolved in DMSO-d6 and D2O, respectively and lyophilised three times from their respective solvent to exchange deuterium. 13C NMR spectroscopy was performed at 400 MHz and 40°C with approximately 15000 scans. 31P NMR spectroscopy was performed at 161.97 MHz and 40°C with 64 scans. Similarly, 31P NMR analysis of the milled sodium hexametaphosphate was performed. Before analysis, sodium hexametaphosphate was milled alone by planetary ball miller and then dissolved in D2O and lyophilised three times from D2O to exchange deuterium.Cell culture of murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell lineThe murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 10% foetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in a 96-well plate at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator [32]. RAW264.7 cells were harvested with a trypsin/EDTA solution (Gibco, USA). The cells were counted and plated into 96-well plates at 5×105 cells/mL. Viability was routinely >97%. Cells were incubated overnight prior to beginning experiments.Cell proliferation of RAW264.7 cellsThe effect of β-D-glucan phosphate on the viability of RAW264.7 cells was determined using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium] bromide (MTT) assay [32]. After pre-incubating RAW264.7 cells (5×105 cells/mL) for 12 h, β-D-glucan phosphate or native β-D-glucan (50, 100, or 500 µg/mL) or lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 µg/mL) were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 48 h. Twenty microlitres of the MTT stock solution (5 mg/mL) was then added to each well to attain a total reaction volume of 200 µL. After incubation for 4 h, the plate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were aspirated. The formazan crystals in each well were dissolved in 150 µL DMSO, and the absorbance at 570 nm was recorded on a Molecular Plus-384 ELISA reader (Molecular, USA). Three wells were used for each GP concentration, and three independent experiments were performed.Neutral red uptake by RAW264.7 CellsThe ability of GP to improve the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells was determined by neutral red uptake analysis. After the pre-incubation of RAW264.7 cells (5×104 cells/mL) for 12 h, each β-D-glucan phosphate or native β-D-glucan (50, 100, or 500 µg/mL) or LPS (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 µg/mL) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 24 h. The supernatant was then removed from the plate. Two hundred microlitres of fresh medium containing 0.01% neutral red was added into each well, and the cells were cultured for an additional 1 h. After 1 h, the cell plate was washed three times with PBS, and 200 µL of cell lysis buffer (acetic acid/ethanol; 11) was added into each well, which was then kept at 4°C overnight [33]. The absorbance at 540 nm was detected using a Molecular Plus-384 ELISA reader.Determination of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) production and NO secretion in RAW264.7 cellsThe ability of GP to induce cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) production and NO secretion in RAW264.7 cells was determined using a commercial ELISA kit and Griess assay, respectively. After pre-incubating RAW264.7 cells (5×105 cells/mL) for 12 h, each β-D-glucan phosphate or native β-D-glucan (50, 100, or 500 µg/mL) or LPS (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 µg/mL) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 48 h. The concentration of TNF-α and IL-6 in culture supernatants was determined using an ELISA kit (eBioscience, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The NO content of the culture supernatants was measured by adding 50 µL of Griess reagent (1% sulphanilamide and 0.1% N-[1-naphthyl]-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 2.5% phosphoric acid) to 50-µL samples. The NO concentration was determined at 540 nm using NaNO2 as a standard [32].Statistical analysisResults were expressed as the means ± SD. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for data analysis using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) (10.0) software. Significant differences were indicated at p<0.05, whereas highly significant differences were indicated at p<0.01.ResultsPreparation of GP by planetary ball millingThe β-D-glucan particles isolated from S. cerevisiae were insoluble in water and weakly dissolved in DMSO [11]. After milling, the apparent PEAK molecular weight of all of the GPs prepared decreased greatly to 6.6–10.0 kDa (Table 1), much lower than that of the initial β-D-glucan material (430 kDa) (Fig. 1). Meanwhile, the water solubility and DS of each GP sample were also different, in accordance with the operating conditions (Table 1). Among the three operation parameters, the rotational speed of ball milling affected the water solubility of the GP products to the greatest extent, likely due to the different mechanical forces acting on the materials. The water solubility of GP-2 (78%) prepared at a rotational speed of 186.0 rad/s was much higher than that of GP-1 (54%) prepared at a speed of 139.5 rad/s (Table 1). Therefore, the ball-milling process was performed at a rotational speed of 186.0 rad/s in the following experiments.Figure 1HPLC chromatogram of native β-D-glucan NG and three β-D-glucan phosphates, GP-2, GP-4, and GP-5 prepared by planetary ball milling.Table 1β-D-glucan phosphates prepared under different operation conditions.As the milling time increased from 12 min to 20 min, the water solubility of the GP products increased slightly, from 78% for GP-2 to 85% for GP-3 and 84% for GP-4, whereas the DS of the GP products increased significantly, from 1.24 for GP-2 to 2.09 for GP-4 (Table 1), indicating that the milling time has a significant impact on the efficiency of the phosphorylation reaction. Meanwhile, the DP of the GP products decreased from 30.5 for GP-2 to 17.6 for GP-4. In addition, the charge ratio of β-D-glucan to sodium hexametaphosphate also affects the phosphorylation of β-D-glucan. When β-D-glucan was co-milled with sodium hexametaphosphate at weight ratios of 12, 14, and 16, respectively, at a rotational speed of 186.0 rad/s for 20 min, the DS of the GP products reached 0.77, 2.09, and 1.95, respectively, whereas the DP of the GP products decreased to 33.7, 17.6, and 26.0, respectively (Table 1), indicating that 14 is a suitable charge ratio for producing GP with a much higher DS. Meanwhile, the polysaccharide yield after this phosphorylation process was about 70%, with the yield during the milling process 100% and that during the subsequent dialysing process 70%. Therefore, when operating under suitable conditions, soluble GP with a lower molecular weight and high DS could be successfully synthesised by the proposed mechanochemical method.Energy transferred during the milling processTo estimate the amount of energy transferred to synthesised materials via milling and to reveal the mechanochemical mechanism underlying this process, several methods have been employed to model the dynamics of planetary ball milling, such as the particle element method, the use of analytical/numerical models, and the discrete element method [21]. Among the various models, the one described by Magini and coworkers has been well accepted [22]. The following equation was deduced from this model to calculate the power P* transferred to a unit mass of milled powder [34]. The values predicted by this equation show good agreement with experimental observations made with respect to milling ball motion and energy transfer.According to the above equation, the energy transferred to a milled powder depends on the number of balls (Nb), the angular velocity of the vial (ωv) and plate (ωp), the geometrical parameters of the planetary ball-milling machine (Rv, Rp, and db), and the milling time (t). In our experiment, the weight of the powder PW=15 g; the number of milling balls Nb=1935; the weight of one ball mb=7.80×10−5 kg; the milling time t=720, 960, or 1200 s; the angular velocity of the plate ωp=117.00 or 87.75 rad/s; the angular velocity of the vial ωv=186.00 or 139.50 rad/s; the distance from the centre of the plate to the centre of the vial Rp=5.20×10−2 m; the radius of the vial Rv=3.50×10−2 m; the diameter of the milling balls db=3.00×10−3 m; and the empirical factor related to the degree of filling of the vial b=0.87. Among these parameters, the angular velocity and milling time are the two most important variables, with the former affecting the transferred energy and the resulting mechanochemical reaction more greatly than the latter.When milling for 12 min, the transferred power P* increased from a value of 3.03 KJ/g for a rotational speed (i.e., ωv) of 139.50 rad/s to 7.19 KJ/g for a rotational speed of 186.00 rad/s (Table 1). Accordingly, the water solubility of the corresponding GP product increased significantly. When the rotational speed was set to 186.00 rad/s, the transferred power P* increased linearly from 7.19 KJ/g for a milling time of 12 min to 11.98 KJ/g for a milling time of 20 min. Although the water solubility of three corresponding GP products was similar (approximately 80%), the DS of these GPs increased from 1.24 to 2.09, whereas the DP of these GPs decreased from 30.5 to 17.6, indicating that through varying the energy to some extent, GP products with different DS and DP could be produced and the energy provided by the planetary ball-milling machine was sufficient to induce the phosphorylation reaction between β-D-glucan and sodium hexametaphosphate as well as depolymerisation of β-D-glucan. However, although the energy transferred to GP-4, GP-5, and GP-6 was same, the DS of these three GPs varied significantly, indicating that besides the energy, other factors such as charge ratio would also influence the efficiency of phosphorylation reaction.Chemical characterisation of GPThe structural changes in GP were monitored by FTIR as well as 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra of the initial insoluble β-D-glucan particles NG and the soluble derivatives GP-2 and GP-4 are compared in Fig. 2. The spectrum of untreated β-D-glucan is identical to that of β-D-glucan reported elsewhere [35], with the strong peak at 3430 cm−1 attributed to O–H stretching, the peak at 2923 cm−1 attributed to C–H stretching, and a peak at 1632 cm−1 attributed to the bending of bound water molecules. Two new peaks appeared in the spectra of GP-2 and GP-4: a strong peak at 1268 or 1271 cm−1 corresponding to the P=O bond and a slightly weaker peak at 893 or 889 cm−1 corresponding to the P–O bond, indicating that mechanochemical phosphorylation between β-D-glucan and sodium hexametaphosphate occurred during planetary ball milling.Figure 2FTIR spectra of insoluble β-D-glucan particles NG and soluble β-D-glucan phosphate GP-2 and GP-4 prepared by planetary ball milling.The 13C NMR spectrum of the initial insoluble β-D-glucan particles NG in DMSO-d6 (Fig. 3) is identical to those of S. cerevisiae β-D-glucans reported elsewhere [5], [36]–[38]. The initial insoluble β-D-glucan contains β-(1→3)- and β-(1→6)-linked D-glucosyl units, the former component being the predominant one. The 13C NMR spectrum of NG contains the signals corresponding to the carbon atoms of both types of units (Fig. 3). The main peaks at 103.0, 86.2, 76.3, 72.8, 68.4, and 60.9 ppm are assigned to the C1, C3, C5, C2, C4, and C6 of β-(1→3)-linked D-glucosyl units [5], [36], [37]. While the small peaks at 103.3, 76.5, 75.8, 73.2, 69.8, and 68.1 ppm can be attributed to the C1, C3, C5, C2, C4, and C6 of β-(1→6)-linked D-glucosyl units [36], [38]. The 13C NMR spectrum of the soluble β-D-glucan phosphate GP-2 (DS 1.24) in D2O showed the presence of new peaks (Fig. 3). The main peaks at 102.9, 84.9, 76.1, 71.7/72.0, 68.6, and 61.2/61.0 ppm are assigned to the original C1, C3, C5, C2, C4, and C6 of β-(1→3)-linked D-glucosyl units. While the small peaks at 103.3, 77.7, 75.4, 73.2, and 69.3 ppm can be attributed to the original C1, C3, C5, C2, and C4 of β-(1→6)-linked D-glucosyl units. A strong new peak appeared at 73.6/73.7 ppm in GP-2 is assigned to the substituted C2 (marked as C2s), whereas a small new peak at 70.1/69.9 ppm is designated as the signal of weakly substituted C4 (marked as C4s), because the chemical shift of substituted carbon will move into downfield and partial substitution will widen the peaks of substituted carbon [39]. This is similar to those observed in sulfated derivatives of (1→3)-β-D-glucan with DS of 1.14–1.74 [40] and sulfated derivative of α-(1→3)-D-glucan with DS of 1.4 [41], although the downfield shift of a carbon atom linked by a sulfate group there is 7–10 ppm and here by a phosphate group is about 2 ppm. Moreover, a new peak at 100.1 ppm can be assigned to C1 (marked as C1′) because C2 was substituted and thus influenced the chemical shift of the adjacent C1 [39]. Therefore, phosphate groups have been chemically bound to β-D-glucan.Figure 313C NMR spectra of insoluble β-D-glucan particles NG and β-D-glucan phosphate GP-2 prepared by planetary ball milling.Further, 31P NMR spectral analysis of the initial insoluble β-D-glucan particles NG in DMSO-d6 and the soluble derivative GP-2 in D2O was undertaken to confirm the presence of the phosphate group in GP product. No signal was observed in NG, whereas a strong phosphorus signal was observed at 2.69 ppm in GP-2 (Fig. 4), similar with previously reported β-D-glucan phosphate [5], [42] as well as phosphated (1→3)-α-D-glucan [43], confirming that phosphate groups were bound to the molecular chain. In addition, two small signals were observed at –7.44 and –18.75 ppm, suggesting that other types of phosphate group were present in the phosphated β-D-glucan derivative, perhaps being minor portions of polysaccharide diphosphates and oligophosphates, as reported in starch phosphates [30]. This was further demonstrated by a weak signal at –9.87 ppm and a strong signal at –21.66 ppm observed in 31P NMR spectrum of sodium hexametaphosphate milled alone [milled (NaPO3)6] (Fig. 4). Therefore, in view of the 13C and 31P NMR results, phosphate groups have been chemically bound to β-D-glucan.Figure 431P NMR spectra of insoluble β-D-glucan particles NG, β-D-glucan phosphate GP-2 prepared by planetary ball milling, and sodium hexametaphosphate (NaPO3)6 milled alone.Immunostimulating properties of GP on macrophage RAW264.7 cellsMacrophages play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity and are considered the main target cells of β-D-glucans. Macrophages act as the first line of immune defence by phagocytosing environmental particles and pathogens, recruiting and activating inflammatory cells, and producing a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators, such as TNF-α, ILs, and NO, to regulate their own activity and the activity of other immune cells [44]. To examine whether the mechanochemically produced GP was able to stimulate the functional activation of macrophages, murine macrophage cells of the line RAW264.7 were incubated with 50–500 µg/mL of GP product or native β-D-glucan, and cell proliferation, neutral red uptake, cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) production, and NO secretion were measured and compared to the amount produced by the untreated control group. Three GP products with different DS and DP, i.e., GP-2 with a DS of 1.24 and DP of 30.5, GP-4 with a DS of 2.09 and DP of 17.6, and GP-5 with a DS of 0.77 and DP of 33.7, were measured.Effect of GP on the proliferation of macrophage RAW264.7First, the cytotoxic effect or proliferation effect of three GP products on RAW264.7 cells was examined. The MTT assay indicated that GP-2, GP-4, and GP-5 as well as NG and LPS enhanced the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, among which GP-2 exerted the most significant proliferation enhancement effect (114%, 121%, and 127% at concentrations of 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL), which was nearly same with the native β-D-glucan (Fig. 5A). GP-4 and GP-5 only enhanced the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells significantly at 500 µg/mL (p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively).Figure 5Effects of native β-D-glucan and three β-D-glucan phosphates, GP-2, GP-4, and GP-5, on cell proliferation (A) and neutral red uptake (B) of RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were treated with NG or GP (50, 100, and 500 µg/mL) or LPS ...Effect of GP on the phagocytosis capacity of RAW264.7 cellsThe amount of neutral red uptake by macrophages was measured to analyse the phagocytic ability of RAW264.7 cells incubated with GP products and native β-D-glucan. The phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells increased significantly after being stimulated by a higher concentration (500 µg/mL) of GP-2, GP-4, and GP-5, with GP-2 inducing the greatest extent of phagocytosis (161%), which was equal to that stimulated by 1 µg/mL of LPS (Fig. 5B). However, a lower concentration of GP-4 also significantly stimulated the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells (50 µg/mL, p<0.01; 100 µg/mL, p<0.05), whereas a lower concentration of GP-2 and GP-5 did not. But the native β-D-glucan could stimulate the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells at each concentration, in a concentration-dependent manner.Effect of GP on the TNF-α and IL-6 production and NO secretion of RAW264.7 cellsFinally, the secretion of two major cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, as well as a major inflammatory mediator, NO, by RAW264.7 cells incubated with GP was measured. TNF-α is an important host defence molecule that affects tumor cells. All three GP products and NG, as well as the positive control LPS, significantly stimulated TNF-α production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). The TNF-α production induced by GP-2 was much higher than that induced by GP-4 and GP-5, and also obviously higher that induced by NG. After being stimulated with 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL of GP-2 for 48 h, TNF-α production in the culture supernatant increased to 6.3-, 7.2-, and 13.1-fold that of the control, respectively. However, GP-4 and GP-5 stimulated TNF-α production significantly only at a concentration of 100–500 µg/mL (p<0.01), inducing a level of production 1.4–3.6- and 1.4–3.1-fold that of the control.Figure 6Effects of native β-D-glucan and three β-D-glucan phosphates, GP-2, GP-4, and GP-5, on TNF-α (A) and IL-6 (B) production by RAW264.7 cells.IL-6 is a major cytokine involved in B cell differentiation, T cell activation, induction of acute phase proteins, and reduction of the G0-residence time of hematopoietic cells. NG, GP-2, and GP-4, as well as LPS, induced IL-6 secretion in RAW264.7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with GP-2 stimulating a higher level of secretion than GP-4 and a lower level of secretion than NG, whereas GP-5 suppressed IL-6 secretion (Fig. 6B). After being stimulated with 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL of GP-2, IL-6 production in the culture supernatant increased significantly to 2.6-, 4.5-, and 14.9-fold that of the control, respectively. GP-4 only induced the secretion of IL-6 significantly at a concentration of 500 µg/mL (p<0.05).NO is a major mediator of macrophages that acts as a destroyer to bacteria and tumor cells. A Griess assay indicated that all three GP productss and native β-D-glucan, as well as LPS, induced secretion of NO significantly in a concentration-dependent manner, with GP-2 triggering the highest level of NO secretion and GP-5 the lowest among the three GPs, whereas NG similar with GP-2 (Fig. 7). After being stimulated with 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL of GP-2, the concentration of NO in the culture supernatant increased to 4.8-, 50-, and 5.7-fold that of the control, respectively. After being stimulated with 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL of GP-4, the amount of NO secreted increased to 1.7-, 3.0-, and 4.9-fold that of the control, respectively. On the other hand, GP-5 only triggered NO secretion significantly at concentrations of 100 and 500 µg/mL (p<0.01). Therefore, among the three GP products, GP-2 with a DS of 1.24 and DP of 30.5 exhibited the strongest immunostimulating activity and was nearly similar with NG.Figure 7Effects of native β-D-glucan and three β-D-glucan phosphates, GP-2, GP-4, and GP-5, on NO secretion by RAW264.7 cells.DiscussionThe application of an environmentally friendly, solvent-free, and convenient method, mechanochemical processing, to phosphorylate and solubilise β-D-glucan isolated from brewer’s yeast, S. cerevisiae, was investigated in this study. Water-soluble β-D-glucan derivatives, β-D-glucan phosphates, with a greatly reduced apparent PEAK molecular weight of 6.6–10.0 kDa and high DS of 0.77–2.09 as well as greatly decreased DP of 17.6–33.7 were successfully prepared by planetary ball milling (Table 1). The result indicated that the tight helical structure of β-D-glucan molecules could be broken and activated to react with sodium hexametaphosphate by mechanical force. Moreover, the phosphorylation efficiency of the planetary ball-milling process was very high because the reaction could be completed within 20 min, indicating that mechanical energy was effectively transformed into the internal energy of the milled materials. This transformed energy could improve the chemical reactivity of the hydroxyl groups of β-D-glucan molecule and increase the number of metastable active sites, with which the sodium hexametaphosphate could rapidly react. When the insoluble β-D-glucan was depolymerised and modified with the hydrophilic phosphate groups by this process, its water solubility improved significantly. Most importantly, compared to the traditional phosphorylation process of β-D-glucan, which is carried out in an organic solvent at elevated temperature [5], our process is convenient, clean, solvent-free, and easy to implement. The phosphorylation reaction could be performed by a one-step process. Therefore, it may be favourable for environmental and industrial application.The presence of phosphate groups in the GP products was demonstrated by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 2) as well as 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 3 and ​and4).4). The obtained GP products were biologically active and able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated macrophage cells of the RAW264.7 line, such as cell proliferation, phagocytosis, cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) production, and NO secretion (Fig. 5–7), especially TNF-α production and NO secretion, with GP-2 (DS=1.24, DP=30.5) exerting the highest immunostimulating activity, which was similar with the native β-D-glucan.However, according to previous reports, the immunity-modulating activity of yeast β-D-glucans depends on the molecular weight, glycosidic linkages, and chemical groups attached to the main chain. Phosphated β-D-glucan with a DS of 0.14 prepared by traditional chemical modification in an organic solvent has been reported to exert immunity-modulating activity [13], [14]. β-D-glucan sulfate with a DS of 1.14 and molecular weight of 46 kDa has been reported to exhibit the highest anti-tumor activity among several sulfated derivatives [16]. Carboxymethylated β-D-glucan derivative with DS of 0.75 showed the highest mitogenic activity, while derivatives with DS higher than 1.0 were inactive [17]. These researches demonstrate that the appropriate DS and chemical group influences the activity of β-D-glucan. In this study, a comparison of GP products with the similar apparent PEAK molecular weight (6.6–10.0 kDa) and various DS and DP demonstrated that GP-2 with a DS of 1.24 and DP of 30.5 exerted higher biological activity than GP-4 with a higher DS (2.09) and lower DP (17.6) and GP-5 with a lower DS (0.77) and higher DP (33.7) (Fig. 5–7), suggesting that the appropriate DS of phosphate groups and the appropriate DP of β-D-glucan are the two main determinants of immune cell stimulation. Meanwhile, the biological properties of GP-2 were similar with those of the initial β-D-glucan particles, among which the TNF-α secretion of RAW264.7 cells stimulated by GP-2 were even a little higher than that by native β-D-glucan. The reason for the different immunostimulating activities of these GP products will be researched further.In conclusion, mechanochemical processing can be used as a simple, efficient, and clean method to produce biologically active GP, which may be attractive for industrial application.Funding StatementThis work was financially supported by grants from Science and Technology Support Project of Jiangsu Province (BE2012428) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (JUSRP 21109).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

ABSTRACT
We have investigated the entry pathway of Borna disease virus (BDV). Virus entry was assessed by detecting early viral replication
                     and transcription. Lysosomotropic agents (ammonium chloride, chloroquine, and amantadine), as well as energy depletion, prevented
                     BDV infection, indicating that BDV enters host cells by endocytosis and requires an acidic intracellular compartment to allow
                     membrane fusion and initiate infection. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that BDV-infected cells form extensive
                     syncytia upon low-pH treatment. Entry of enveloped viruses into animal cells usually requires the membrane-fusing activity
                     of viral surface glycoproteins (GPs). BDV GP is expressed as two products of 84 and 43 kDa (GP-84 and GP-43, respectively).
                     We show here that only GP-43 is present at the surface of BDV-infected cells and therefore is likely the viral polypeptide
                     responsible for triggering fusion events. We also present evidence that GP-43, which corresponds to the C terminus of GP-84,
                     is generated by cleavage of GP-84 by the cellular protease furin. Hence, we propose that BDV GP-84 is involved in attachment
                     to the cell surface receptor whereas its furin-cleaved product, GP-43, is involved in pH-dependent fusion after internalization
                     of the virion by endocytosis.
                  

Borna disease virus (BDV) causes central nervous system disease in several vertebrate species manifested by behavioral abnormalities
                  and diverse pathology (18, 29,36). Besides, there is accumulating evidence that BDV can infect humans and is possibly implicated in certain human neuropsychiatric
                  disorders (1, 3, 13, 14, 25, 37, 38, 49), providing further impetus for the study of this novel neurotropic agent.
               
BDV is a nonsegmented, negative-stranded (NNS) RNA virus, the prototype of a new family in the Mononegavirales order (12,40). The recent cloning and sequencing of the BDV genome have provided tools to study its molecular biology. BDV has a genomic
                  organization characteristic of Mononegavirales (6,10). However, as with plant nucleorhabdoviruses, BDV replicates and transcribes in the nucleus (5, 8), which is unique among known animal NNS RNA viruses.
               
Previous studies have suggested that a cellular receptor is required for BDV infection (15). However, little is known about the mechanism by which BDV enters the host cell. After adsorption at the cell surface, which
                  is a receptor-mediated event, enveloped viruses enter cells by fusing with cell membranes (reviewed in references32 and 51). This fusion event can occur at the plasma membrane, or alternatively, the virus can be internalized by receptor-mediated
                  endocytosis and delivered to endosomes. The acidic interior of the endosome will trigger fusion events, usually related to
                  a conformational change in a viral glycoprotein (GP) with fusogenic properties, that will allow the viral genome to be released
                  into the cytoplasm. AmongMononegavirales, entry by members of theParamyxoviridae occurs by fusion at the plasma membrane and is pH independent (28), whereas Rhabdoviridae andFiloviridae (31) fuse only when the pH is acidic along the endocytotic pathway. Entry of acid-dependent viruses can be inhibited by treatment
                  with lysosomotropic agents that raise the intracellular pH and hence prevent endosomal acidification (32).
               
To examine the mechanisms of BDV entry, we developed an assay that allows the detection of the early steps of BDV replication
                  and transcription. C6 rat glioma cells (ATCC CCL 107) were seeded in 24-well plates and infected at a multiplicity of infection
                  of approximately 0.5 focus-forming unit per cell with cell-free BDV prepared as described previously (16). RNA was extracted at 0, 4, and 8 h postinfection, and BDV RNA species were detected by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR.
                  We used the previously described primers 3.1 and 3.2, which flank intron I of the BDV transcription map (11). These primers allow the detection of products of 470 and 377 bp, corresponding to unspliced mRNA/antigenomic RNA and spliced
                  mRNA, respectively (Fig. 1). In pilot experiments, we determined those experimental conditions, including multiplicity of infection, number of cycles
                  of PCR, and time postinfection, that would allow a semiquantitative determination of BDV RNA levels (data not shown).

Overview of the RT-PCR assay used to detect early BDV replication and transcription. The positions of primers 3.1 and 3.2
                        relative to the BDV transcription map are indicated.
                     



Cells were left untreated or were treated 1 h prior and during infection with three well-characterized lysosomotropic agents,
                  i.e., ammonium chloride at 20 mM, chloroquine at 60 μM, and amantadine (AD) at 0.5 mM. These concentrations have been shown
                  by others as being optimal in preventing endosomal acidification and having low short-term toxicity (35). Under these conditions, entry of viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and rabies virus is effectively inhibited
                  (4, 46). All three lysosomotropic agents effectively inhibited or greatly decreased BDV RNA synthesis (Fig.2). This effect was not merely virucidal, since treatment of the virus with these agents during the adsorption phase did not
                  block subsequent infection upon removal of drugs (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that entry of BDV is pH dependent.
                  Importantly, AD was used in our assay in the millimolar range of concentrations. At these concentrations, AD is an established
                  pH-raising compound and has a nonspecific antiviral activity on a number of viruses by blocking their endosomal release (23). In contrast, at lower concentrations (micromolar range), AD has a specific antiviral effect against influenza A viruses,
                  due to a specific blockade of the ion channel activity of the influenza M2 protein (22). Although AD has been proposed to have antiviral activity against BDV at micromolar concentrations (2), results from our group (9) and others (20) have contradicted such findings.

Lysosomotropic agents block BDV infection. C6 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with cell-free BDV. The cells
                        were pretreated for 1 h with the different agents indicated at the top of the figure; this treatment was maintained throughout
                        the experiment. RNA was extracted from the cells at 0, 4, and 8 h after the beginning of infection and analyzed by RT-PCR.
                        (A) Results with primers designed to amplify a region of the BDV genome that contains intron I. The use of these primers allows
                        the detection of BDV antigenomic and unspliced mRNA (top arrow) as well as spliced mRNA (bottom arrow). Due to the electrophoresis
                        conditions, the band in lane 12 appears to migrate faster than in that in lane 3 but, however, it corresponds to the 470-bp
                        BDV amplimer. (B) Amounts of RNA recovered for each time point. Pictures of gels were taken with a Stratagene Eagle Eye and
                        scanned with an Agfa Studiostar scanner, and the composite image was generated with Adobe Photoshop and Canvas softwares.
                     



The requirement of a low-pH-dependent step for BDV entry suggests that the virion is internalized by endocytosis. Endocytosis
                  is an energy-driven, ATP-dependent process and therefore can be blocked with inhibitors of ATP synthesis. We examined the
                  effect of energy depletion on BDV entry by treating cells with sodium azide (NaN3) and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (dGluc), which block oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, respectively, by using procedures described before
                  (27). Briefly, Vero cells were preincubated with 0.1% NaN3 and 50 mM dGluc for 1 h. The virus was then adsorbed at 37°C for 90 min, and infection was carried out for 2 h with the inhibitors
                  still present. Extracellular virus was inactivated by incubation for 90 s with acid glycine buffer (pH 2.2). Fresh medium
                  without inhibitors was added, and 6 h later, RNA was extracted and BDV RNA species were detected as described above. Energy
                  blockade prevented BDV infection (Fig.3A, lane 4). However, omission of the inactivation of extracellular virus (Fig. 3A, lane 3), which could then be taken up during the 6-h incubation phase in the absence of the inhibitors, resulted in a productive
                  infection and demonstrated that the treatment with the inhibitors of cellular energy production was reversible. Also, infection
                  with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which penetrates cells by direct fusion at the plasma membrane and does not require
                  cellular energy for this process (43), was not affected by the treatment (Fig. 3B). Sodium azide and dGluc also inhibit transport of nuclear proteins and RNA. Although highly unlikely, our results could
                  also be due to differences between the nuclear import of HSV-1 DNA and that of BDV RNA. Nevertheless, our data support the
                  hypothesis that BDV is taken up by the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and that fusion is pH dependent.

(A) Entry of BDV requires cellular energy. Vero cells were infected for 2 h with BDV with or without the addition of 0.1%
                        sodium azide (NaN3) and 50 mM dGluc. After the infection period, the cells were washed and subjected to a brief low-pH treatment to inactivate
                        external virus (lanes 1 and 4), new medium without inhibitors was added, and the cells were harvested and analyzed 6 h later.
                        BDV replication and transcription were assessed by RT-PCR as illustrated in Fig. 1. In a separate RT-PCR, we used primers specific for GAPDH (bottom arrow) to monitor for the quality of the recovered RNA.
                        Aliquots of both RT-PCR products were combined and loaded on the same gel for analysis. (B) Entry of HSV-1 is not affected
                        by energy depletion. (i) Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 by the same protocol described for panel A. RNA was harvested
                        24 h postinfection and analyzed by Northern blotting with a probe spanning the entire immediate-early gene region of HSV-1.
                        Arrowheads indicate the positions of the HSV-1 transcripts. (ii) The loading of each lane in the gel is illustrated. Images
                        were processed as described in the legend to Fig. 2.
                     



This hypothesis was further supported by the finding that BDV-infected cell lines formed extensive syncytia when subjected
                  to a low-pH treatment (Fig. 4). Cells were washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 5 min with prewarmed 20 mM citrate-phosphate buffer
                  at pH 5 or 7. The cells were washed and returned to normal medium. One hour later, the cells were fixed for 10 min with 0.25%
                  glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, counterstained with 1% methylene blue–0.25% basic fuchsin in methanol, rinsed
                  in water, and examined by light microscopy. Formation of giant multinucleated cells was observed with several BDV-infected
                  cell lines, such as C6 or Vero, when the cell lines were treated at pH 5 but not when they were treated at pH 7. Fusion was
                  not observed in the acid-treated uninfected control cell lines (Fig. 4). Since fusion was complete within 1 h following the pH drop, it is likely that fusion is mediated by a viral protein(s)
                  already present at the cell surface. Fusion was not observed in 100% of the infected cells. This is likely due to the fact
                  that the expression of BDV GP is restricted in persistently infected cells. Only a fraction of cells express levels of BDV
                  GP detectable by immunofluorescence (16).

BDV-infected cells form syncytia when treated at low pH. C6 and Vero cells persistently infected with BDV (C6BV and Vero BV),
                        as well as noninfected control cells, were treated for 5 min with 20 mM citrate-phosphate buffer at pH 7 (top row) or pH 5
                        (bottom row). After the cells were washed and incubated for 1 h in normal medium, they were fixed, counterstained, and examined
                        by light microscopy. Pictures were taken with a video camera and processed as described in the legend to Fig. 2.
                     



Virus surface GPs are usually involved in the penetration of enveloped viruses by triggering fusion of the viral envelope
                  with cell membranes (39). We and others have recently characterized BDV GP (16, 41). We have shown that BDV GP is expressed as two glycosylated products of 84 and 43 kDa (GP-84 and GP-43, respectively). GP-84
                  corresponds to the full length of BDV GP, and GP-43 corresponds to the C terminus of BDV GP. Using a cell surface biotinylation
                  assay described elsewhere (16), we studied which BDV proteins are present at the surface of infected cells. Consistent with our previous results, we found
                  that among the four major BDV structural proteins, only GP-43 is present at the cell surface (Fig.5). Therefore, we postulate that GP-43 is likely to mediate the acid-triggered fusion of BDV-infected cells and, consequently,
                  of virus particles upon infection. To investigate whether BDV GP was sufficient to induce fusion, we transfected Vero cells
                  with a plasmid vector expressing the BDV GP open reading frame under the control of a cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter
                  by using lipofectamine as described previously (17). After acid treatment, the transfected cells were processed as described above and the number of syncytia was counted. We
                  found that cells transfected with the BDV GP expression vector displayed about 10 times more syncytia (defined as foci of
                  three or more nuclei) than cells transfected with BDV nucleoprotein (NP) or matrix (M) protein expression constructs or with
                  a vector without an insert (data not shown). However, the extent of fusion observed was lower than that found in BDV-infected
                  cells. This could be due to experimental conditions. In particular, we observed that BDV GP expression was low and restricted
                  to a limited number of cells, despite transfection efficiencies of 40 to 60%, as monitored by transfection with a vector expressing
                  lacZ under the control of the same cytomegalovirus promoter (data not shown). The reasons for this low expression are presently
                  unknown, but recent evidence suggests that expression of BDV GP is tightly regulated (42). Alternatively, another BDV protein(s), as well as cellular proteins induced by the infection, could play a potentiating
                  role in fusion. BDV p16 protein, the counterpart of the M protein found in other NNS RNA viruses, could play a role in virus
                  entry. It has been shown that BDV M protein is glycosylated and that it might be present at the surface of the virion (21, 26, 45). Nevertheless, we did not detect BDV M protein at the surface of infected cells, suggesting that this protein is unlikely
                  to be involved in triggering fusion of BDV-infected cells.

Fig. 5.
GP-43 is the only BDV polypeptide present at the cell surface of infected cells. BDV-infected C6 cells (C6BV) or uninfected
                        C6 cells (C6) were biotinylated with a lipid-impermeable reagent, and cell surface proteins were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose
                        beads as described previously (16). Aliquots of the surface fraction (Surf) as well as equivalent amounts of whole-cell extracts (WCE) were analyzed by Western
                        blotting with rabbit antisera raised against the BDV GP protein (A), the BDV p40 (NP) and BDV p24 (P) proteins (B), both antisera
                        being combined in this assay, or the BDV p16 (M) protein (38) (C). Arrows indicate the positions of the expected polypeptides. Images were processed as described in the legend to Fig.
                        2.
                     



We have proposed that GP-43 is generated by cleavage of GP-84 by a cellular protease (16). At the expected cleavage site of GP-84, at positions 245 to 249 of the protein, there is a motif of 5 arginine residues
                  (RRRRR). This sequence conforms to the minimal consensus sequence R(K/R)(K/R)R recognized by furin, a cellular calcium-dependent,
                  subtilisin-like endoprotease. Furin cleaves many cellular and viral GP precursors, including the measles virus fusion (F)
                  protein (50) and the gp160 protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (19). It also cleaves the hemagglutinin (H) protein of avian influenza virus (44), and it has been shown that cleavability of this polypeptide is one main determinant of virus pathogenicity (24). To test whether furin is responsible for the cleavage of BDV GP, we infected LoVo cells (LoVo Neo) with a recombinant vaccinia
                  virus expressing the BDV GP (VV-BVGP). LoVo cells, a human colon carcinoma cell line, lacks functional furin because of a
                  single base deletion in the furin gene causing a translational frameshift (47). Cells were harvested 16 h after infection and analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of BDV GP products. Only
                  GP-84 was detected in VV-BVGP-infected LoVo cells. In contrast, production of GP-43 was restored in two VV-BVGP-infected LoVo
                  cell clones stably transfected with the mouse furin gene (LoVo Fur1 and Fur2, a gift from N. Kitamura [48]) (Fig. 6, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, infection of LoVo Neo cells with both VV-BVGP and a vaccinia vector expressing
                  furin (VV-Furin, a gift from G. Thomas), but not with a control vaccinia virus expressing the T7 RNA polymerase (VV-T7), also
                  restored the production of GP-43 (Fig. 6, lane 6). In contrast, production of the BDV p40 protein was not modified upon infection with VV-Furin. These results demonstrate
                  unequivocally that furin is the major cellular protease responsible for cleavage of GP-84 and generation of GP-43. However,
                  we cannot rule out that other subtilisin-like endoproteases are also able to cleave BDV GP.

Fig. 6.
BDV GP-43 is generated by cleavage of GP-84 by the cellular protease furin. LoVo Neo cells, which lack functional furin, and
                        LoVo Fur1 and Fur2 cells, two clones stably transfected with the mouse furin gene, were infected with VV-BVGP (lanes 1 to
                        3). LoVo Neo cells were also infected with different combinations of VV-BVGP, VV-T7, recombinant vaccinia virus expressing
                        the BDV p40 (NP) protein (VV-BVp40), and VV-Furin (lanes 4 to 9). Sixteen hours after infection of the cells, whole-cell extracts
                        were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting with the antisera indicated at the bottom of the figure. Arrows indicate the
                        positions of the expected GP-84 and GP-43 polypeptides. Additional bands, including one close to GP-43, were detected in cells
                        infected with VV-T7 alone (lane 4) and were considered the result of nonspecific binding of the BDV GP antiserum. Images were
                        processed as described in the legend to Fig. 2.
                     



Members of the Mononegavirales exhibit a variety of strategies to enter cells. Paramyxoviridae, such as measles virus, have two surface GPs, the H and F proteins (28). The H protein is responsible for the interaction with the viral cellular receptor, e.g., CD46 in the case of measles virus
                  (30, 34). The F protein, whose precursor is cleaved by furin into the F1 and F2 subunits along the constitutive secretory pathway, induces pH-independent cell fusion and allows entry and cell-to-cell transmission
                  of the virus (33). In some paramyxoviruses, interactions between the H and F proteins are required for fusion (33). In contrast, members of theRhabdoviridae, such as rabies or vesicular stomatitis virus, express only a single GP at the surface of the virion. This protein is responsible
                  for both viral attachment and fusion upon endocytosis and endosomal acidification (7). From our previous results and those presented herein, we would like to propose an alternate mechanism for the processing
                  of BDV GP and its role in virus entry. BDV expresses a single GP as a full-length product of 84 kDa. We have reported that
                  a rabbit antiserum raised against BDV GP, which recognizes only the GP-84 product under native conditions, can neutralize
                  BDV infectivity (16). This leads us to hypothesize that GP-84 is responsible for the interaction with the cellular receptor for BDV. GP-84 is
                  cleaved by furin to generate GP-43, which is also associated with BDV infectious particles. After endocytosis, acidification
                  in the endosome will likely induce a conformational change of GP-43 that will consequently trigger fusion, a situation mimicked
                  by acid treatment of BDV-infected cells. Interestingly, sequence analysis indicates that the new N terminus of GP-43, which
                  is exposed after GP-84 cleavage by furin, is highly hydrophobic. This is reminiscent of the fusogenic domain described for
                  surface GPs of other viruses, such as the H protein of influenza virus or the F protein of paramyxoviruses (51). Nevertheless, there is no significant similarity between the BDV GP sequence and the fusogenic peptide consensus sequence
                  derived from F1 proteins of paramyxoviruses (28).
               
The BDV genome (8.9 kb) is significantly smaller than those of the other known Mononegavirales (11 to 20 kb). Likely as a result of this smaller size, BDV has developed a variety of concurrent strategies for its gene
                  expression regulation. These include an overlap of transcription units and transcriptive signals, a read-through of transcription
                  termination signals, and RNA splicing (12,40). BDV GP expression and function represent a new situation in NNS RNA viruses that is somewhat intermediate between the strategies
                  adopted by paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses. The strategy adopted by BDV for the expression of its GP might be related to
                  its exquisite ability to establish persistence. Animals chronically infected with BDV have high levels of viral antigen and
                  RNA in the central nervous system. However, only extremely low levels of enveloped infectious virions are detected, and viral
                  budding has not yet been observed in BDV-infected tissues and cells (18). This might be related to the restriction of BDV GP expression in infected cells. As a consequence, BDV GP is poorly recognized
                  by serum antibodies from infected animals.
               
The cleavage of GP-84 by furin is likely required for exposure of a new hydrophobic N terminus in GP-43. This new N terminus
                  will, in turn, be responsible for the pH-dependent fusion event necessary for a BDV-productive infection. Despite the localization
                  of BDV GP products in separate cellular compartments, both products are associated with infectious virions (16). Hence, the accumulation of GP-84 and GP-43 in different cellular compartments may impose additional constraints on the
                  production of infectious particles. The low level of virus production may contribute to escape from the host immune response
                  and may favor the establishment of persistent infection.
