Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, our views with respect to future financial and operating results, competitive pressures, market interest rates for our variable interest rate indebtedness, our ability to raise capital or borrow additional funds, changes in the Australian, New Zealand or Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, regulatory changes, customer defaults or insolvencies, litigation, acquisition of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate or control, our ability to secure adequate levels of products to meet customer demand, our ability to procure adequate supplies for our manufacturing operations, labor disruptions, adverse resolution of any contract or other disputes with customers, declines in demand for our products and services from key industries such as the Australian natural resources industry or the U.S. construction of oil and gas industries or a write-off of all or other part of our goodwill and intangible assets.These involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements. We believe that the expectations represented by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, but there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. For more details regarding these risks, please see the Risk Factors section of our periodic reports filed with the SEC and posted to our website at generalfinance.com.

Ron, please go ahead.Ron ValentaThank you, Chris. Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss General Finance’s results for the first quarter fiscal year 2015. As usual, I’ll begin with a brief discussion of our operations and then provide an update on our outlook for fiscal year 2015. Our CFO, Chuck Barrantes will then provide a financial overview and following his remarks, we will open the conference call to your questions.We are extremely pleased to reported as you’ve all seen that we’ve come out of the gate with a very strong performance and operating momentum, generated another quarter of record results. Our North American leasing operations have hit ball out of the park, resulting in our 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in both total revenues and adjusted EBITDA.We continued to successfully execute our strategic initiatives to expand our container fleet while maintaining high average utilization rates and implementing increases across most of our product lines. We also continued our strategy of supplementing our organic growth with creative acquisitions. Since the beginning of this fiscal year, we have completed two acquisitions of portable storage container business in North America investing approximately $20 million and adding four branch locations to our network of approximately 40 locations across 20 states in United States and one province in Canada.Our growth in North America has been driven by across the board, strength in all of our product lines but particularly from our container base products such as portable liquid tank, portable storage and office containers.Revenues from our leasing operations more than doubled and adjusted EBITDA more than tripled in the first quarter for the prior year’s quarter. We have grown our lease fleet in units by 36% over the last 12 months and our overall average utilization for the most recent quarter was 81%, up from 77% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013.The financial contribution from loans are far exceeding our initial expectations as we’re capitalizing on the strength and demand for portable liquid storage tank containers and related services in the Texas region.Pac-Van has also seen broad-based improvement in a number of key sectors including commercial, mining and energy, construction and industrial. Southern Frac, our manufactured portable liquid storage tank containers also had a strong quarter, generating total standalone revenues of $14.8 million, up nearly 50% from the previous year. This was due to increased demand at our North American leasing operations. Adjusted EBITDA on a standalone basis for the first quarter nearly tripled to $3.1 million up from $1.1 million in last year’s first quarter.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com
