Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Vision, Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel and Nova are the All-New, All-Different Avengers - but can they stay together long enough to be more than a footnote in the team's great history? Maybe not, when the events of Standoff pit them against the Uncanny Avengers. Who will prove themselves the mightiest Avengers of all? Things get worse as the mysteries of Pleasant Hill deepen. The Avengers can't tell the heroes from the villains - and now they don't even recognize each other! How can they be effective as a team when their memories have been stolen? Plus, the Avengers must face someone new with an old name - one that goes right back to the beginning. Who is the all-different Wasp? And will she be friend or foe?

The Altar of Sacrifice is the first of “The Books of the Way of Sacrifice.” The first volume in this closely woven trilogy consists of three inner books, each revealing legendary power of the Olde Ways, attained through the Arte of Bloody Sacrifice. The Volumes of Sacrifice are forged from a practice that was born of gnosis received beyond the Gates of the Final Judgement of the Soul, a pact undertaken in free will by the author with Lucifer, in the name of Hecate.
The Path of the Devotee is illuminated from the initial Gift and Pact that opens The Way of Sacrifice, to the formation of the Mother Temple of Four Pillars of Fire through Vortices of Death and Gnosis of the Apocalyptic Keys. Glyphs filled with sacrificial blood open the Backward Atlantean Path of Hecate. The bodies of forest beasts of modern and ancient worlds are entered, with the Formula of Soul Inversion. Knowledge of the Atlantean Priests is revealed. The Elemental Temple Dragon is awoken. The Chalice of Sacrifice, the Grail of Sepheranz, is created as the gateway through which the soul is drawn to bathe in the Blood of the Gods.
In an age of restriction and taboo, engineered to hide the true carnage of man’s occupation of this world, the destruction of the planet itself, this is not solely a book of the Sacrificial Arte. It is the first gate, manifested and opened in blood, through which the Trident Kin reveal the Apocalyptic Keys. Created from flesh in bloody sacrifice, these keys unleash the Wrath of the Gods.
Standard Blood Pact Edition: 999 Handbound volumes of superior quality to all previous standard editions. Bound in luxurious Lynnel Tan Charbon. Finished with Peregrina Majestic Bronze endpapers. Blocked and stamped in deep copper foil with the Sacred Seal of Flesh and Fur. Publishing date Samhain 2013.

The Witchblood Grail is the Second Volume of the trilogy The Way of Sacrifice.
The knowledge within this book was bestowed by the spirits of the Witchflame Arte in the name of Hecate and Her Kin. The prophecies of the Destiny of Man are woven within. The rituals may be used collectively or be singularly adapted to the path of the individual. Independent practitioners of the Magickal Spiritual Arte will find empowerment through the rites of sacrifice and blood within this tome.
For the devotees of Primal Witchflame this is the essential companion to The Altar of Sacrifice. The rites within grant the gnosis of temple initiation and the completion of the formula of the Four Pillars of Flame - the successive performance of which en-fleshes the Bones of the Great Beast with each drop of blood, ultimately awakening and manifesting the Maw of the Dragon; opening the Gateway to the Devil's Throne.
The Witchblood Grail carries gnosis of the Dragon Flame current, ensorcelled within sacrificial blood work by the spirits of Witchcraft that dwell within Belial's Flesh. This second volume consists of the Four Inner Books of the Flesh.
--------------------
Contents include:
The Book of Hecate's Initiate Blood: Rites of Initiation - the Path of the Outcast - are laid bare; Ensouling the spirit and consciousness of Belial within the Fetish Lord; Procurring and bestowing upon others The Toadstone Familiars; The completion of gnosis required to form a Temple or Coven of the Primal Arte is given.
Rites of Body and Soul: Heritage of ritual human sacrifice; The ritual incarnation of spirits and Daemons of Witchflame through human birth; Formation of the inner and physical plane Atlantean Temple of Sepheranz; The embodiment in human flesh of the Serpent God;
Communion with the Vampyric Spirits of both Dark and Full Moons to curse and bless: The formation and flight of Incubus and Succubus forms - as taught by the Spirits of the Arte - to attain sexual congress, to initiate, heal or place the malefic mark upon another from within the horned shadow, forged of blood and sacrificial flesh.
Gnosis of the Gates of Inversion, as universal prophecies, is delivered by Lucifer. The Dragon's Bones are en-fleshed; as the Gateway to the Devil's Throne is opened within the Vortices of Death, created in sacrificial offering.
The formation of The Devil's Flesh grants the ability to remove illness, sickness and malefica, or to inflict them. The Arte of Exorcism: removing unwanted entities from the flesh of others from locations or dwelling places, is granted hand in hand with the power to inflict this possessive indwelling harm. The Devil's Flesh becomes both a reservoir of bound spiritual forces, and the gate through which trapped or damned spirits may be freed.
*As you are reserving your copy for The Witchblood Grail you will be one of the first to receive this priceless release from Mark Alan Smith. As soon as you reserve your copy you will be given a voucher applicable for the remaining balance. Once the book has been published your voucher is valid for up to 60 calendar days from the published date.
