“Great location and well renovated hotel”


Reviewed March 14, 2013




It was a good two day stay at a very affordable price. Most staff was very nice, and I enjoyed staying there very much. The location is great. The internet coming with the hotel worked well for reading e-mails, and you have an option to go faster if you need to do something more (I didn't try). The breakfast was very good. A single bed may be a bit small for some people, but it was good for me. If I have to say something for this recently renovated hotel, I would like to have a power outlet and a desk light near/on the desk for work. I wish they could have one more fire escape route (I didn't check carefully but that's how I felt). I had a dinner which cost me EUR9 including one bottle of beer.

“Definitely a favorite!!!”


Reviewed March 13, 2013




I travel to Belgrade at least 4 times per year and since I first stayed at Excelsior , I had no intention to look for any other hotel. Beautiful and strategic location, modern refurbished spacious rooms, attentive cleaning service and decent breakfast. Most of all though amazing service!!! Friendly, smart and accommodative stuff that will make your day.Recomended with no doubt whatsoever!!

“Pleasant, friendly an enjoyable stay”


Reviewed March 11, 2013




Stayed here for a week on business, hotel is about a 15 minute taxi drive from Nikola Tesla airport. My experience was certainly that all the staff were pleasant, friendly and very helpful. The whole hotel was clean and looks as if it has been recently refurbished to a high standard.I had a double room which had a walk in shower, modern fittings, a little bit small maybe but ample for one person. Room itself had wardrobe, nice comfy bed, small table and two comfy chairs, room safe in wardrobe. What I found really helped was another door between the bedroom and the main door to the room, this made sure you didn't hear anyone else coming back late at night.Wi-Fi throughout the hotel was good although the continual need to login if you changed floors became a bit of a nuisance.Breakfast was continental/buffet style, you were able to order omelettes if you wanted to.If I was returning to Belgrade I would definitely stay here again.

“Excellent choice”


Reviewed March 2, 2013




Read the reviews on Tripadvisor for Hotel Excelsior and agree that it is a very nice, clean hotel with good value. The location was good as we were able to walk to the various tourist areas, and the neighborhood was safe being very close to Parliament and Embassys. The staff was friendly, spoke very good English, and helpful with directions and recommendations.We flew in to Belgrade and took a taxi to the hotel, the driver was familiar with the hotel and took us directly there pointing out sights along the way. There is a flat fee into the city from the airport so avoid the taxi "cowboys" in the terminal and go directly to the taxi kiosk.We left Belgrade by train, and and it was a short inexpensive ride to the train station.

“Stay in Excelsior Hotel Belgrade”


Reviewed February 16, 2013




Excellent value in its class. Excellent location. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast good. Evening meals very good - Serbian Traditional Veal Soup in particular. TV has lots of stations. Room very clean. One criticism is the smell of cigarette smoke in the restaurant though that is the same nearly everwhere in Belgrade and in fairness to Excelsior, there is a spacioous non-smoking section in the restaurant. I'll stay here again.

“Always worth it”


Reviewed January 23, 2013




For several years I have been visiting Belgrade on my regular business trips. Only recently I discovered the Excelsior Hotel and since then I have been staying in the Excelsior several times. The hotel Excelsior and especially the staff made my stays very enjoyable, and there was never any problem that the very friendly and hospitable staff was not able to solve. There was hardly any hotel in Belgrade where I was looking that much forward to breakfast than in the Hotel Excelsior. I can only recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Belgrade, because of the+ good location (not in the heart of the city, but a 15 minutes walk close to it)+ most friendly staff I ever encountered in a Belgrade hotel+ great breakfast with many fresh things, and excellent coffee (you can also get an Espresso, if you just ask for it)+ good Internet connection (wired and wireless)+ clean and new interiour+ comfortable beds+ nice showerThe only downside are the rooms that are located along the main street (Kneza Milosa). In summer you can't leave the window open, as it's quite noisy from 6 a.m. till 8 p.m. If you keep the windows closed, it is however no problem at all.


Room Tip: Rooms that are located along the main street (Kneza Milosa) are generally more noisy than the others...

“My stay in Excelsior hotel, Belgrad”


Reviewed January 12, 2013




Location of hotel magnificent. Close, by foot, to all interesting points of the city.Reception persons are professional and very friendly. Vladimir has an outstanding knowledge of the city and the country. He is permanently ready to help the guest with any question. Special thanks to him and good luck for his professional growing!Breakfast is of average quality. Thus there is no constancy in disposing products. By the way, restaurant staff are good.WiFi quality has to be constant and have good covering on all hotel.Rooms are clean, comfortable with cosy windows. Room rate corresponds to quality.In total very positive impression of my stay. Would come back.Thank you!

Palm Products LLC | The dude abides, man.

Our Mission



Palm Products LLC is a growing and dynamic ecommerce retailer. We track, analyze, and use our years of experience to manage, market and retail products for some of nation’s top manufacturers. We are committed to a mutual success between us and our brand partners-suppliers through versatility, adaptability, and most importantly…quality relationships.
 

 
 



Our Strategies



There is no such thing as a “one size fits all” approach…especially when it comes to ecommerce. Every product we take on deserves a different approach, tailored ultimately for the consumer seeking the purchase. With online shopping, there is no need for the old marketing methods of “broadcasting” in hopes to build a top-of-mind name recognition for when then consumer is ultimately making a buying decision. We focus on a “narrowcasting” approach that seeks to serve as an informational resource for consumers shopping for that product. This can be done through a mix of search engine optimization, keyword strategies, and channel distribution.
 

 
 



Our Insights



Our years of experience in online retailing have taught us a couple things. First, too many retailers use price as their sole marketing method, especially online. It becomes a race to the bottom with pricing by trying to gain a market share strictly through being the lowest price. This is the easy way to do it and takes the least amount of work, strategy, and know-how. We believe this will ultimately hurt the brand in both perception to consumer and bottom line of the income statement. Second, we “Narrowcast”. This is probably something you will hear us say a lot. When focusing on reaching consumers, we try and be as specific as possible. For instance, instead of building an advertising campaign focused on a generality like women, ages 25 to 40, we believe in building a more focused approach like women, ages 31 to 35, who live in the Northeast, and watch Grey’s...
 

 
 



Our Future



The future is bright! We are excited for the direction that our company is moving and the partnerships that we have built. The dynamics of today’s marketplace mean that we are constantly searching and refining what our strategies, focuses, and channels will be in the future.
