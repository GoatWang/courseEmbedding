The MRIdian System







true image guided radiation therapy



The MRIdian System

The MRIdian® system gives clinicians a fresh approach to observing, assessing, and personalizing a patient’s treatment. Using a patented combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radiation therapy delivery technology, the MRIdian system provides high-quality pretreatment images and continuous soft-tissue imaging during treatment—not minutes before the treatment, or after the treatment is delivered, but while the beam is on. When clinicians can clearly see the target and watch where the radiation dose is actually being delivered, they are better able to adapt to changes in the patient’s anatomy.

A new kind of medical technology company


In brief
 Corporate status: Publicly held
 Market: Radiation therapy and imaging technologies  Founded: 2004  Headquarters:                                Cleveland, Ohio
                                  Early adopters: 

Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes&dash;Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri
                                    
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System – Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center 
University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, Madison, Wisconsin



ViewRay®, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRAY), designs, manufactures, and markets the MRIdian® radiation therapy system to address the key limitations
                        of existing external-beam radiation therapy technologies. MRIdian employs MRI-based technology to provide real-time imaging that
                        clearly defines the targeted tumor from the surrounding soft tissue and other critical organs during radiation treatment. MRIdian
                        allows physicians to record the level of radiation exposure that the tumor has received and adapt the prescription as needed. ViewRay
                        believes this combination of enhanced visualization, on-line adapting and accurate dose recording will significantly improve the
                        safety and efficacy of radiation therapy, leading to better outcomes for patients.
                         
ViewRay holds the exclusive worldwide license for its combination of MRI and radiation therapy technologies. MRI-guided radiation therapy
                        was conceived by company founder James F. Dempsey, PhD, while he was a member of the radiation oncology faculty at the University
                        of Florida in 2004. University of Florida leaders encouraged Dempsey to bring his invention to the marketplace, where it could
                        potentially benefit cancer patients, and ViewRay was formed.
In 2011, landmark patents were issued for ViewRay’s core technology in both the United States and Europe. Broadly covering both the
                        medical instrument and the method of implementation, the patents acknowledge the unique combination of simultaneous MRI and radioisotope irradiation.

Here's Why Things Aren't Looking Good for ViewRay, Inc. Today
A lack of product revenue booked in the first quarter isn't sitting well with the market.











                Cory Renauer
            

                (TMFang4apples)



            
            May 16, 2017 at 4:12PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of ViewRay, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRAY), a med-tech company focused on improving cancer treatment, are getting beaten up after a less-than-thrilling earnings report was released after the bell yesterday. As of 3:40 p.m. EDT, the stock was 11.9% lower than its previous close.
So what
ViewRay Inc.'s fancy MRI-guided radiation-therapy delivery systems aren't cheap. This year the company expects to generate between $45 million and $50 million in total revenue, mainly from the sale of seven or eight MRIdian Linac systems.

Image source: Getty Images.

If ViewRay can book that revenue this year, it would be a tremendous launch for the system, which just received FDA clearance in February. Unfortunately, investors will have to be a bit more patient. The company didn't book any product revenue during the first quarter and doesn't expect to do so until the second half of the year.





Now what
The good news is that ViewRay's $144.9 million backlog at the end of this March was 62% higher than the backlog it reported at the same time last year. The company also has a larger cash cushion after completing some value-diluting share offerings recently.
So far this year patient investors have watched ViewRay's share count rise about 32%, but the company also finished the quarter with $49.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Operations lost $10.95 million in the first quarter, which means the company might not require another trip to the equity tap in the foreseeable future, provided it can deliver on its backlog in a timely manner.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of 4,000,000 shares of common
stock in this offering will be approximately $45.0 million at an assumed initial
public offering price of $13.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the range
set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately $52.2 million after
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by
us.

Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of
$13.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page
of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately $3.7 million, assuming that the number of shares
offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the
same, and after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We may also increase or decrease the number of shares we
are offering. An increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 in the number of shares we are
offering would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by
approximately $12.1 million, assuming the assumed initial public offering price
remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discount.

We currently intend to use our existing cash and the net proceeds that we will
receive from this offering as follows:

. approximately $18.0 to $25.0 million to support the ongoing commercialization 
  of MRIdian, including, sales and marketing activities, manufacturing and 
  supply chain management, installation, customer support and product quality; 
  and

. approximately $17.0 to $20.0 million to fund research and development capital 
  and expenses related to continued product development activities; and

. the remainder for general corporate purposes, including working capital.

We do not expect that a change in the offering price or the number of shares by
these amounts would have a material effect on our intended uses of the net
proceeds from this offering, although it may impact the amount of time prior to
which we may need to seek additional capital.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies or
technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or understandings
for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion
of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from
this offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including:

. personnel costs to support our product development and commercialization 
  efforts;

. the outcomes of our research and development efforts; 

. the timing of regulatory approvals for MRIdian in foreign countries; and

. our operations as a public company.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, 
certificates of deposit or government securities.


We compete directly with companies marketing IGRT devices for the treatment of
cancer using CT, ultrasound, optical tracking and X-ray imaging. We also compete
with companies developing next-generation IGRT devices, specifically those
developing MRI-guided devices, amongst others. We expect technological advances,
including the ability to provide real-time imaging, clinical outcomes, size,
price, operational complexity and operational efficiency to drive competitive
market dynamics.

Our major competitors with devices approved for distribution in the United
States or globally include Varian Medical Systems, Inc., or Varian, Elekta AB,
or Elekta, and Accuray Incorporated. Many of our direct competitors have greater
financial, sales and marketing, service infrastructure and research and
development capabilities than we do, as well as more established reputations and
current market share. The main limitations of currently approved devices are the
lack of real-time, clear images before and during the treatment, as well as the
ability to perform on-table adaptive planning.

We are also aware of two commercial and two academic ongoing research efforts to
develop radiation therapy systems incorporating MRI. Elekta and Royal Philips
have formed a consortium to develop the Elekta-Philips MRI-linac, and Varian is
working with IMRIS on a multi-room configuration combining IMRIS’s MR imaging
technology with Varian’s TrueBeam radiation system. The University of Sydney,
Ingham Institute and the University of Queensland have formed a partnership to
develop an MRI-linac and the University of Alberta’s Cross Cancer Institute is
working on an MRI-linac as well. Although these academic research efforts may
not compete directly with us commercially, if one of our competitors were to
form a partnership with one of these institutions to commercialize their system,
it could impact our sales negatively. Of these four, we believe the Elekta-
Philips MRI-linac is the most advanced in development, although we believe this 
system is still years away from approval. MRIdian is the first and only 
commercially available MRI-guided radiation therapy device to image and treat 
cancer patients simultaneously.

The limited capital expenditure budgets of our customers results in all
suppliers to these entities competing for a limited pool of funds. Our customers
may be required to select between two items of capital equipment. For example,
some of our potential customers are considering expensive proton therapy systems
which could consume a significant portion of their capital expenditure budgets.


Company Description
We design, manufacture and market MRIdian, the first and only MRI-guided
radiation therapy system that images and treats cancer patients simultaneously.
Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, is a broadly used imaging tool which has the
ability to differentiate between types of soft tissue clearly,


 unlike X-ray or
computed tomography, or CT, which are the most commonly used imaging
technologies in radiation therapy today. MRIdian integrates MRI technology,
radiation delivery and our proprietary software to locate, target and track the
position and shape of soft-tissue tumors while radiation is delivered. These
capabilities allow MRIdian to deliver radiation to the tumor accurately while
delivering less radiation to healthy tissue than existing radiation therapy
treatments. We believe this leads to improved patient outcomes and reduced side
effects from off-target radiation delivery. Physicians have used MRIdian to
treat a broad spectrum of radiation therapy patients with more than 20 different
types of cancer, as well as patients for whom radiation therapy was previously
not an option.

We received 510(k) marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, for MRIdian in May 2012 and received permission to affix
the CE mark in November 2014. Patients are actively receiving treatment on
MRIdian systems at three cancer centers located at Washington University in 
St.Louis, University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Wisconsin–
Madison. We generated revenue of $3.2 million in 2013 and $6.4 million in 
2014 and had net losses of $27.2 million in 2013 and $33.8 million in 2014. At 
December 31, 2014, we had 10 signed sales contracts for MRIdian systems in 
backlog with a total value of $54.7 million, of which we expect to recognize 
approximately 40% to 60% as revenue in 2015 representing four to six MRIdian 
systems. The determination of backlog includes objective and subjective 
judgment about the likelihood of an order becoming revenue. We evaluate our 
backlog at least quarterly to determine if the orders continue to meet our 
criteria for inclusion in backlog. Our judgment and evaluation may be incorrect 
and orders may be delayed or cancelled for reasons beyond our control. Projects 
included in backlog may be removed if we determine the particular order no 
longer constitutes a valid order. We cannot assure you that our backlog will 
result in revenue on a timely basis or at all, or that any cancelled contracts 
will be replaced. Accordingly, our backlog is an uncertain indicator of our 
future earnings.

Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for over eight
million deaths per year globally. Radiation therapy is a common method used to
treat cancer that uses lethal doses of ionizing energy to damage the genetic
material in cells. Nearly two-thirds of all cancer patients in the United States
will receive some form of radiation therapy during the course of their illness,
according to estimates by the American Society for Radiation Oncology.

In 2013, IMV Medical Information Division, Inc. reported that 93% of patients
receiving radiation therapy in the United States were treated by an
external-beam radiation therapy device called a linear accelerator, or linac.
The global linac market was $2.8 billion in 2011 and was expected to grow to
$3.7 billion by 2016, according to a 2012 Markets and Markets report. IAEA Human
Health Campus reports that there are over 11,000 linacs installed at over 7,500
centers worldwide. We believe the addressable market for MRIdian is the annual
market for linacs due to its ability to treat a broad spectrum of disease sites.
However, we believe that MRIdian may be used more frequently for complex cancer
cases that may be difficult to treat on a standard linac due to the location of
the tumor in relation to the surrounding soft tissues. We currently estimate the
annual market for linacs to be 1,100 units per year globally, the majority of
which are replacement units.

The MRIdian System







true image guided radiation therapy



The MRIdian System

The MRIdian® system gives clinicians a fresh approach to observing, assessing, and personalizing a patient’s treatment. Using a patented combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radiation therapy delivery technology, the MRIdian system provides high-quality pretreatment images and continuous soft-tissue imaging during treatment—not minutes before the treatment, or after the treatment is delivered, but while the beam is on. When clinicians can clearly see the target and watch where the radiation dose is actually being delivered, they are better able to adapt to changes in the patient’s anatomy.
