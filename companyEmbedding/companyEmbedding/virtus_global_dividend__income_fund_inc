Virtus Global Dividend & Income Fund Inc. Declares Distribution And Discloses Sources Of Distribution - Section 19(a) Notice




HARTFORD, Conn., June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Virtus Global Dividend & Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: ZTR) announced the following monthly distribution:



Amount of Distribution


Ex-Date


Record Date


Payable Date



$0.113


June 8, 2017


June 12, 2017


June 19, 2017

Under the terms of its managed distribution plan, the fund will seek to maintain a consistent distribution level that may be paid in part or in full from net investment income and realized capital gains, or a combination thereof. Shareholders should note, however, that if the fund's aggregate net investment income and net realized capital gains are less than the amount of the distribution level, the difference will be distributed from the fund's assets and will constitute a return of the shareholder's capital. You should not draw any conclusions about the fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the fund's managed distribution plan. 
The fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund's investment performance and should not be confused with "yield" or "income." 
The fund provided this estimate of the sources of the distribution:

About the FundThe Virtus Global Dividend & Income Fund Inc. is a diversified closed-end fund that seeks to generate total return, consisting of capital appreciation and income. It currently targets an allocation of 60 percent equity securities and 40 percent fixed income. The equity allocation is invested exclusively in what the managers believe are high-quality companies within the high yielding global equity universe. The fixed income allocation is invested primarily in intermediate-term debt securities across 14 fixed income sectors. The fund also pursues an options income strategy whereby it purchases and sells out-of-the money puts and calls, creating an options spread.

Product Overview

    The Fund is a diversified fund that has a current target allocation of its assets being invested in 60% equity securities and 40% fixed income. The Fund seeks to generate total return, consisting of capital appreciation and income. The equity allocation invests exclusively in what the managers believe are 'high-quality' companies within the high yielding global equity universe.  Businesses and management teams that return the free cash flow generated by the business to shareholders via dividends are the focus. The fixed income portion of the fund is designed to generate high total return from both current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in intermediate-term debt securities across 14 fixed income sectors. The fund employs a time-tested approach of active sector rotation, extensive credit research, and disciplined risk management designed to capitalize on opportunities across undervalued areas of the fixed income markets. A team of investment professionals provides significant research depth across all bond market sectors. The Fund also pursues an options income strategy whereby it purchases and sells out-of-the money puts and calls, creating an options spread. Effective September 7, 2016, Virtus Investment Advisers became the Investment adviser to the Fund and two subadvisers were appointed to manage the Fund. Performance and characteristics prior to that date were attained by the previous Adviser using a different investment strategy. Prior to September 27, 2016, the fund was named The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc.

David Albrycht is president and chief investment officer of Newfleet Asset Management. Prior to joining Newfleet in 2011, Mr. Albrycht was executive managing director and senior portfolio manager with Goodwin Capital Advisers, a former Virtus investment management subsidiary. He joined the Goodwin multi-sector fixed income team in 1985 as a credit analyst and has managed fixed income portfolios since 1991.


Mr. Albrycht is portfolio manager of Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Short Term Bond Fund since 1993 and Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Intermediate Bond Fund since 1994; and co-manager of Virtus Newfleet Senior Floating Rate Fund since 2008, Virtus Tactical Allocation Fund and Virtus Newfleet High Yield Fund since 2011; Virtus Newfleet Bond Fund, Virtus Strategic Allocation Fund, and Virtus Newfleet Low Duration Income Fund since 2012; and Virtus Newfleet Credit Opportunities Fund since 2015.

In February 2013, Virtus Investment Partners was named Barron’s “Best Taxable Bond Fund Family” for 2012, an honor also received in 2010, due in large part both years to the expert management of the firm’s multi-sector fixed income strategies by Mr. Albrycht and the Newfleet team.1 Mr. Albrycht has been a recipient of several Lipper analytical certificates and recognized by industry groups as a leading multi-sector fixed income strategist.

Mr. Albrycht earned a B.A., cum laude, from Central Connecticut State University and an M.B.A., with honors, from the University of Connecticut. He holds the Chartered Financial Analyst designation. He has been working in the investment industry since 1985.


1Best Taxable Bond Fund Family ranked 1 of 62 Fund Families, on a one-year basis, in the 2012 Barron’s/Lipper 2012 Fund Survey, published in the February 11, 2013 issue of Barron’s. Ranked 42 of 58 in 2011 and 1 of 57 in 2010.
Barron’s explanation of how it ranks fund families: To qualify for the Barron’s/Lipper fund survey, a group must have at least three funds in Lipper’s general U.S.-stock category, as well as one in world equity, which combines global and international funds. Also required is at least one mixed-asset (or balanced) fund, which holds stocks and bonds. Fund shops also must have at least two taxable-bond funds and one tax-exempt offering.


For the first time this year, the performance of emerging-market funds was included in the world equity category. Each fund’s returns are adjusted for 12b-1 fees, which are used for marketing and distribution expenses. The funds usually add these fees back into returns. The aim is to measure the manager’s skill. Fund loads, or sales charges, aren’t included in the calculation of returns, either. Each fund’s return is measured against those of all funds in its Lipper category. That leads to a percentile ranking, with 100 the highest and 1 the lowest, which is then weighted by asset size relative to the fund family’s other assets in its general classification. If a family’s biggest funds do well, that boosts its overall ranking. Poor performance in a big fund can have a big effect on the ranking.


Finally, the score is multiplied by the weighting of its general classification, as determined by the entire Lipper universe of funds. 2012 category weightings for one-year results: general equity, 34.9%; world equity, 16.3%; mixed-asset, 17.3%; taxable bonds, 27.2%; and tax-exempt bonds, 4.3%. 2010 category weightings for one-year results: general equity, 40.52%; world equity, 14.32%; mixed equity, 16.46%; taxable bonds, 24.52%; tax-exempt bonds, 4.18%.


The scoring: Say a company has a fund in the general U.S. equity category that has $50 million in assets and that it accounts for half of the company’s assets in that category. Its ranking is the 75th percentile. The first calculation would be 75 times 0.50, which comes to 37.5. That score is then multiplied by 38.04, general equity’s overall weighting in Lipper’s universe. So it would be 37.5 times 0.3804, which totals 14.265. Similar calculations are done for each fund in our study. Then, all the numbers are added up for a total score. The fund shop with the highest score wins, both for every category and overall.


Strong ratings may not be indicative of positive fund performance. Performance for some funds may be negative.

Performance data quoted represents past results. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Performance reflects the deduction of fund operating expenses. Performance does not reflect the incurrence of brokerage expenses, which typically apply to exchange traded products. Total return net of brokerage expenses would be lower than the total returns on market value shown in the table.

Expenses








Net Asset Value vs. Market Price
Net Asset Value (NAV) represents the total value of all assets held by the Fund (minus its total liabilities), divided by the total number of common shares outstanding. The net asset value returns reflect the performance of the manager. Market price is the price at which investors may purchase or sell shares of the Fund. Market price is determined in the open market by buyers and sellers, based on supply and demand. The Fund’s Market Price fluctuates throughout the day and may differ from its underlying NAV. Shares of the Fund may trade at a premium (higher than) or a discount (lower than) to NAV. This characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the Fund’s net asset value could decline. The Fund has no control over the market price. The difference between the market price and the NAV (Premium/Discount) is expressed as a percentage of NAV. Average annual total return is the annual compound return for the indicated period. It reflects the change in share price and the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains.
Automatic Reinvestment Plan
This plan offers shareholders a convenient way to acquire additional shares of the fund. Registered holders will be automatically placed in the Plan. If shares are held at a brokerage firm, contact your broker about participation.
Fund Distributions and Managed Distribution Plan
Under the terms of the Fund’s managed distribution policy, the Fund seeks to maintain a consistent distribution level that may be paid in part or in full from net investment income and realized capital gains, or a combination thereof. Shareholders should note, however, that if the Fund’s aggregate net investment income and net realized capital gains are less than the amount of the distribution level, the difference will be distributed from the Fund’s assets and will constitute a return of the shareholder’s capital. A return of capital is not taxable; rather it reduces a shareholder’s tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund.The amounts and sources of distributions reported in Section 19(a) Notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Please note that the characterization of Fund distributions for federal income tax purposes is different from book accounting generally accepted account principles (“GAAP”). The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Risk Considerations

Fundamental Risk of Investing: There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. An investment in the shares of the Fund is subject to the risk of loss of principal; shares may decrease in value.
Equity Securities: The market price of equity securities may be adversely affected by financial market, industry, or issuer-specific events. Focus on a particular style or on small or medium-sized companies may enhance that risk.
Credit & Interest: Debt securities are subject to various risks, the most prominent of which are credit and interest rate risk. The issuer of a debt security may fail to make interest and/or principal payments. Values of debt securities may rise or fall in response to changes in interest rates, and this risk may be enhanced with longer-term maturities.
High Yield-High Risk Fixed Income Securities: There is a greater level of credit risk and price volatility involved with high yield securities than investment grade securities.
ABS/MBS: Changes in interest rates can cause both extension and prepayment risks for asset- and mortgage-backed securities. These securities are also subject to risks associated with the repayment of underlying collateral.
Foreign & Emerging Markets: Investing internationally, especially in emerging markets, involves additional risks such as currency, political, accounting, economic, and market risk.
Leverage: When a fund leverages its portfolio, the value of its shares may be more volatile and all other risks may be compounded.
Call/Put Spreads: Buying and selling call and put option spreads on the SPX Index risks the loss of the premium when buying, can limit upside participation and increase downside losses.
Market Price/NAV: At the time of purchase and/or sale, an investor's shares may have a market price that is above or below the fund's NAV, which may increase the investor's risk of loss.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
