                    CEL-SCI is dedicated to research and development directed at improving the treatment of cancer and other diseases by utilizing the immune system, the body's natural defense system.
CEL-SCI's lead investigational therapy, Multikine�* (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection), is currently being developed as a potential therapeutic agent directed at using the immune system to produce an anti-tumor immune response.  Data from Phase I and Phase II clinical trials suggest that Multikine simulates the activities of a healthy person's immune system, enabling it to use the body's own anti-tumor immune response.  Multikine is the trademark we have registered for this investigational therapy, and this proprietary name is subject to review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in connection with our future anticipated regulatory submission for approval.
Twenty four Regulatory Agencies, including leading regulators in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom, have allowed Multikine to be studied in a global Phase 3 clinical trial as a potential neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN. This trial is currently primarily under the management of two clinical research organizations, or CROs, ICON Inc. (who acquired Aptiv Solutions, Inc., one of the two CROs), or ICON, and Ergomed Clinical Research Limited, or Ergomed. Ergomed is responsible for new patient enrollment and the clinical study management of the various study sites, although enrollment of new patients has been on hold since the Company received verbal notice of FDA's Partial Clinical Hold on September 26, 2016. CEL-SCI is diligently continuing to work with the FDA to have the partial clinical hold lifted.  CEL-SCI has been in a continuing dialogue with the FDA to try to resolve their questions and to supply them with supplemental information.   The following is a brief summary of the key operational successes:

86 clinical sites in 24 countries on three continents participate in the global Phase III study.
Patients have been enrolled in the study on all three continents (North America, Europe and Asia). 
Our partners Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries (Israel) and Orient Europharma (Taiwan) have enrolled patients in their respective territories. 
We have produced multiple lots of Multikine in our manufacturing facility near Baltimore, Maryland, USA and provided drug in sufficient amounts at all clinical sites.

In our Phase 3 clinical trial, Multikine is administered to cancer patients prior to their receiving any conventional treatment for cancer, including surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy.  This could be shown to be important because conventional therapy may weaken the immune system, and may compromise the potential effect of immunotherapy. Multikine is given before conventional cancer therapy when the immune system may be more intact.  We believe the possibility exists for it to have a greater likelihood of activating an anti-tumor immune response under these conditions than administering it after radiation and/or chemotherapy. This likelihood is one of the clinical aspects being evaluated in the ongoing global Phase 3 clinical trial. Read more about our trial
The current standard of care, or SOC, treatment regimen for patients with SCCHN consists of surgical resection of the tumor and involved lymph nodes, followed by either radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Our ongoing Phase 3 trial is testing the hypothesis that Multikine treatment, administered prior to such SOC treatment regimen, will extend overall survival, enhance the local/regional control of the disease and reduce the rate of disease progression in patients with SCCHN.
On September 26, 2016, CEL-SCI received verbal notice from the FDA that the Phase 3 clinical trial has been placed on clinical hold. Pursuant to this communication from FDA, patients currently receiving study treatments can continue to receive treatment, and patients already enrolled in the study will continue to be followed. In accordance with the partial clinical hold, CEL-SCI is continuing to follow the 928 patients enrolled in the study, and this includes following patients until the targeted 298 deaths between the 2 comparison groups is observed.  This number of deaths is required to evaluate if the study's primary endpoint is achieved.
On October 21, 2016, CEL-SCI received a partial clinical hold letter from FDA. In its partial clinical hold letter, a) FDA stated that there is an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury to human subjects and cited among other things the absence of prompt reports by us to the FDA of Independent Data Monitoring (IDMC) recommendations to close the study entirely (made in spring of 2014) or at least to close it to accrual of new patients (made in spring of 2016); b) FDA stated that the investigator brochure is misleading, erroneous, and materially incomplete; and c) FDA stated that the plan or protocol is deficient in design to meet its stated objectives. In its partial clinical hold letter, FDA also identified the information needed to resolve these deficiencies. In addition, FDA's partial clinical hold letter included two requests relating to quality information regarding our investigational final drug product, which were noted by FDA as non-hold issues. We believe that our response submitted to FDA on November 18, 2016, addressed each of the deficiencies identified by FDA including detailing our belief that, under the applicable FDA guidance, there was no obligation to report the cited IDMC recommendations to the FDA at the time they were issued, and it also requested a face-to-face meeting with FDA, and outlined our commitment to diligently work with FDA in an effort to have the partial clinical hold for the study lifted.
On December 8, 2016, FDA advised us that the Agency was denying our request for a meeting at that time because FDA's review of our November 18, 2016 response was ongoing. We also were advised that we would be receiving a letter addressing its November 18, 2016 response by December 18, 2016.
On December 16, 2016, FDA issued an Incomplete Response To Hold letter to us indicating that based on the Agency's preliminary review of our November 18, 2016 submission, FDA has determined that it is not a complete response to all of the issues listed in FDA's clinical hold letter. In its letter a) FDA stated that we did not provide the information identified as necessary to address FDA's statement that patients enrolled in the study are exposed to unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury to human subjects; b) FDA stated that we did not provide the information identified as necessary to address FDA's statement that continued enrollment of patients in the study exposes the patients to unreasonable risks and the FDA furthermore stated that the study is unlikely to demonstrate that the addition of our investigational drug Multikine to the standard of care is superior to standard of care and thus should be terminated for futility; (c) FDA stated that we did not provide the information identified as necessary to address FDA's statement that the investigator brochure is misleading, erroneous, and materially incomplete; (d) FDA stated that we did not provide the information identified as necessary to address FDA's statement that the proposed revised clinical protocol is inadequate in design to meet its stated objectives and FDA furthermore stated that this deficiency cannot be addressed by further revisions to the protocol. In its incomplete response to hold letter, FDA also identified the steps we must take to address these deficiencies. In addition, FDA's Incomplete Response to Hold letter noted with respect to FDA's two requests relating to quality information regarding our investigational final drug product, which we had been instructed by FDA to submit separately from the response to the partial clinical hold, which again were noted by FDA as non-hold issues, that our November 18, 2016, submission had not included the information addressing these two requests.
In early January 2017, in preparation for the request for a Type A meeting with FDA and resolution of the partial clinical hold issues, we prepared a comprehensive submission to FDA detailing our belief, accompanied by what we believe to be appropriate supporting data, records, and information reflecting that we have taken the steps necessary to address the specific deficiencies identified by FDA, including: a) demonstrating that patients enrolled in the study are not exposed to unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury; b) demonstrating that continued enrollment of patients in the study does not expose the patients to unreasonable risks and that the study should not be terminated for futility; (c) demonstrating that a supplemented investigator brochure is not misleading, erroneous, or materially incomplete; (d) demonstrating that the proposed revised clinical protocol is adequate in design to meet its stated objectives and that this deficiency can be addressed by the proposed revisions to the protocol.
On February 8, 2017, we met with the FDA to allow an open and frank discussion of the clinical hold issues raised by the FDA and to secure the FDA's input and clarification on how to address the partial hold issues. On March 1, 2017 CEL-SCI received the written minutes of this meeting from FDA.  The Action Items for CEL-SCI to pursue per the minutes from the FDA were the following: 1) provide an updated Investigator's Brochure and current procedures for compliance with requirements under 21 CFR 312 Subpart D to address the partial clinical hold, and 2) provide a list of major protocol deviations, which CEL-SCI believes will affect study results, and provide a plan to identify major protocol deviations across all patients enrolled in the Phase 3 protocol.
We are diligently continuing to work with the FDA to have the partial clinical hold lifted.  We have been in a continuing dialogue with them to try to resolve their questions and to supply them with supplemental information.  We have supplied our response to those Action Items to the FDA.  In accordance with the partial clinical hold, we are continuing to follow the 928 patients enrolled in the study, and this includes following patients until the targeted 298 deaths between the 2 comparison groups is observed.  This number of deaths is required to evaluate if the study's primary endpoint is achieved.
If it were to be approved for use following completion of our clinical development program, Multikine would be a different kind of therapy in the fight against cancer. It would be designed to make the first cancer treatment more successful. Multikine is a defined mixture of cytokines; it is a combination immunotherapy, possessing both active and passive properties.
Phase I and II clinical trial data suggest that Multikine has the potential to directly affect/kill the tumor cells. These data also indicate that it appears to be able to activate the patient's own anti-tumor immune response. During the early investigational phase, in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in a total of over 220 subjects who received the investigational therapy Multikine in (daily) doses of 200 to 3200 IU as IL-2 (over 2-3 weeks in Phase II and up to a few months in early-Phase I), no serious adverse events were reported by the clinical investigators as being expressly due to administration of this investigational therapy.  Adverse events which were reported included pain at the injection site, local minor bleeding and edema at the injection site, diarrhea, headache, nausea, and constipation. No "abnormal" laboratory results were reported following Multikine treatment - other than those commonly seen by treating physicians in this patient population - regardless of Multikine administration. Similarly, in these early-phase clinical studies in patients, there was no reported increased toxicity of follow-on treatments as a result of Multikine administration. No complications following surgery, such as increased time for wound healing, were reported. No definitive conclusions can be drawn from these data about the safety or efficacy profile of this investigational therapy, and further research is required and the global Phase III study is ongoing in an effort to confirm these results.
Multikine is manufactured in CEL-SCI's state-of-the-art "Cold-Fill" manufacturing facility outside of Baltimore. Read more about the investigational therapy Multikine. 
CEL-SCI's other immunotherapy platform technology L.E.A.P.S.** (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System), or LEAPS, currently has multiple investigational therapies in various stages of development, primarily at the pre-clinical stage (in animal studies). These preclinical products/therapies have been shown to protect animals from infection or disease by a number of viruses and parasitic agents. In animal models of the disease, the LEAPS product candidate CEL-2000 has shown promise for development as a therapeutic vaccine for rheumatoid arthritis.   In addition, CEL-SCI is developing another potential LEAPS product candidate, LEAPS-H1N1-DC, a potential treatment for H1N1 influenza in hospitalized patients. Further preclinical research and development is required to elucidate the way these compounds work and is currently ongoing.
* Multikine is the trademark that CEL-SCI has registered for this investigational therapy, and this proprietary name is subject to FDA review in connection with our future anticipated regulatory submission for approval.  Multikine has not been licensed or approved for sale, barter or exchange by the FDA or any other regulatory agency. Similarly, its safety or efficacy has not been established for any use. Moreover, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from the early-phase, clinical-trials data summarized on this page or elsewhere on this website involving the investigational therapy Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection). Further research is required, and early-phase clinical trial results must be confirmed in the well-controlled, Phase III clinical trial of this investigational therapy that is currently on Partial Clinical Hold by the US FDA.
** No LEAPS investigational therapy has been approved for sale, barter or exchange by the FDA or any other regulatory agency for any use to treat disease in animals or humans. The safety or efficacy of these products has not been established for any use. Lastly, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these early-phase, preclinical-trials data involving these investigational products.

Products in Development
Multikine� (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection), or Multikine* -- an investigational immunotherapy under development for the potential treatment of certain head and neck cancers, and peri-anal warts or cervical dysplasia in human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and human papillomavirus, or HPV co-infected patients.
L.E.A.P.S. (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System) technology, or LEAPS** -- has two investigational therapies, LEAPS-H1N1-DC, a product candidate under development for the potential treatment of pandemic influenza in hospitalized patients, and CEL-2000, a vaccine product candidate under development for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
The following chart depicts our product candidates, their indications and their current stage of development:

Multikine
Multikine, CEL-SCI's lead investigational immunotherapy, is an immunotherapeutic agent that is being developed as a potential first-line neoadjuvant therapy  in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and potentially, as a treatment for peri-anal warts in HIV/HPV co-infected patients. If it were to be approved for use following completion of CEL-SCI's clinical development program, Multikine would be a different kind of therapy in the fight against cancer; one that appears to have the potential to work with the body's natural immune system in the fight against tumors.
On September 26, 2016, the FDA placed the Phase 3 clinical trial on partial clinical hold. Subject to the partial clinical hold, CEL-SCI is not be able to enroll any additional patients in the Phase 3 study unless FDA lifts the partial clinical hold. CEL-SCI is diligently continuing to work with the FDA to have the partial clinical hold lifted.  CEL-SCI has been in a continuing dialogue with the FDA to try to resolve their questions and to supply them with supplemental information.  In accordance with the partial clinical hold, CEL-SCI is continuing to follow the 928 patients enrolled in the study, and this includes following patients until the targeted 298 deaths between the 2 comparison groups is observed.  This number of deaths is required to evaluate if the study's primary endpoint is achieved.  Currently CEL-SCI is not looking to enroll any more patients.  CEL-SCI will not be able to enroll any additional patients in the Phase 3 study unless FDA lifts the partial clinical hold.
Multikine may also have the potential to be a first in a new class of cancer immunotherapy drugs. It is the first investigational combination immunotherapy thought to have both passive and active immune properties. More... 
L.E.A.P.S.
LEAPS is a patented, T-cell modulation, peptide epitope delivery technology that enables CEL-SCI to design and synthesize proprietary peptide immunogens. LEAPS compounds consist of a small T-cell binding peptide ligand linked with a disease-associated peptide antigen. This technology has been shown the potential in several animal models to preferentially direct immune response to a cellular (e.g., T-cell), humoral (antibody) or mixed pathway. Diseases for which antigenic epitope sequences have been identified, such as some infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, allergic asthma and allergy, and select CNS diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's) may be potential candidates for development using this technology platform.

Research & Clinical Trials
At CEL-SCI, we are dedicated to changing the way cancer and other diseases are treated.  
Multikine� (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection) is the full name of this investigational therapy, which, for simplicity, is referred to in the remainder of this page as Multikine*.
CEL-SCI's research and development programs focus on utilizing immunotherapy to develop new therapies that have the potential to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer and infectious diseases. To that end, CEL-SCI has initiated a Global Phase III clinical trial of Multikine in patients with Advanced Primary Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity and soft palate (Head and Neck Cancer), a debilitating life-threatening disease, for which the overall five year survival rate has not materially improved over several decades.
On September 26, 2016, the FDA placed the Phase 3 clinical trial on partial clinical hold. Subject to the partial clinical hold, CEL-SCI is not be able to enroll any additional patients in the Phase 3 study unless FDA lifts the partial clinical hold. CEL-SCI is diligently continuing to work with the FDA to have the partial clinical hold lifted.  CEL-SCI has been in a continuing dialogue with the FDA to try to resolve their questions and to supply them with supplemental information.

					Full Description



CEL-SCI Corporation, incorporated on March 22, 1983, is engaged in the research and development at developing the treatment of cancer and other diseases by using the immune system, the body's natural defense system. The Company is focused on activating the immune system to fight cancer and infectious diseases. It operates through the segment of research and development of certain drugs and vaccines. It is focused on the development of product candidates and technologies, including Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection) (Multikine), an investigational immunotherapy under development for the treatment of certain head and neck cancers, and anal warts or cervical dysplasia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) co-infected patients and Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System (L.E.A.P.S.) technology, with over two investigational therapies, LEAPS-H1N1-DC, a product candidate under development for the treatment of pandemic influenza in hospitalized patients, and CEL-2000 and CEL-4000, vaccine product candidates under development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.Multikine is being tested in a Phase III clinical trial in primary head and neck cancer. Multikine has been cleared by the regulators in over 20 countries across the world, including the United States. Multikine is also being used in a Phase I study at the Naval Medical Center, San Diego under a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) with the United States Navy in HIV/HPV co-infected men and women with peri-anal warts. Multikine is an immunotherapy product candidate consisting of a defined mixture of over 10 human natural cytokines and is manufactured in its manufacturing facility. The first indication the Company is pursuing for its Multikine product candidate is an indication for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).Multikine is being developed as a therapeutic agent directed at using the immune system to produce an anti-tumor immune response. Data from Phase I and Phase II clinical trials suggests that Multikine simulates the activities of a healthy person's immune system, enabling it to use the body's own anti-tumor immune response. Multikine is designed to be used in a different way than immune therapy is normally used. Multikine is designed to be administered locally to treat local tumors before any other therapy has been administered. In the ongoing Phase III clinical trial, Multikine is injected locally at the site of the tumor and near the adjacent draining lymph nodes as a first line of treatment before surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. In clinical studies of Multikine, administration of the investigational therapy to head and neck cancer patients has demonstrated the potential for less or no appreciable toxicity.The Company also owns and is developing a pre-clinical technology called Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System (LEAPS). Its T-cell Modulation Process, referred to as LEAPS, uses heteroconjugates to direct the body to choose a specific immune response. LEAPS is designed to stimulate the human immune system to fight bacterial, viral and parasitic infections, as well as autoimmune, allergies, transplantation rejection and cancer, when it cannot do so on its own. Administered like a vaccine, LEAPS combines T-cell binding ligands with small, disease-associated peptide antigens. The Company is developing over two drug candidates, CEL-2000 and CEL-4000, as potential rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic vaccines.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
