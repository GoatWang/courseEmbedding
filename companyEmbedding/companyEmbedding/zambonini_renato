NEEDHAM, Mass. — (BUSINESS WIRE) — May 18, 2011 —

      PTC (Nasdaq: 
PMTC), The Product Development Company®, today 
      announced the appointment of Renato “Ron” Zambonini to its Board of 
      Directors. The appointment of Zambonini as an independent director 
      expands PTC’s Board to seven members.
    

      “Ron Zambonini is a technology industry veteran who brings a wealth of 
      software experience to PTC,” said James E. Heppelmann, president and 
      CEO, PTC. “Throughout his distinguished career, Ron has successfully 
      contributed to the growth and transformation of leading companies. We 
      are pleased to have him on our board as PTC continues along the path of 
      delivering increasing value to its customers, shareholders, and 
      employees.”
    

      Zambonini is the former chairman, as well as president and CEO, of 
      Cognos, where he also served in senior research and development 
      positions. During his 19-year tenure with Cognos, Zambonini was credited 
      with leading the company’s transformation from a specialized business 
      intelligence software tools provider to a global leader in corporate 
      performance management solutions.
    

      “Over the years, PTC has consistently proven itself to be a visionary in 
      its industry,” noted Zambonini. “Its leading-edge product lifecycle 
      management solutions are helping manufacturers overcome increasingly 
      complex product development challenges and, with its new Creo strategy, 
      the company is poised to revolutionize the product design market once 
      again. I look forward to helping PTC capitalize on its tremendous market 
      opportunities.”
    

      Earlier in his career, Zambonini was vice president of research and 
      development at Cullinet Software, Inc. Prior to that, he was general 
      manager for Applied Development Corporation and also held positions at 
      Warrington Inc. and Comtech Group International. Zambonini currently 
      serves on the Board of CA Technologies, Inc. and was previously a 
      director at Reynolds and Reynolds Inc., the world's largest software 
      company servicing automotive dealerships.
