Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Cindi Buckwalter, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Cindi Buckwalter - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cablevision's second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Jim Dolan, CEO; Kristin Dolan, Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Sweeney, President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim will start off the call and then Kristin will provide an operational and product update. Brian will conclude with a review of our financial results. Gregg Seibert, our Vice Chairman, will be available for Q&A. If you do not have a copy of today's earnings release, it is available on our website at cablevision.com.

On page six of today's earnings release, we provide a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating cash flow or AOCF.
I would now like to introduce Jim Dolan, CEO of Cablevision.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Cindi, and good morning. Our second quarter financial results met our expectations. Consolidated revenue grew 2% and AOCF decreased 3% compared to the prior year period. Year-to-date, AOCF is in line with our 2015 outlook. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were $215 million, free cash flow was $158 million, and we continue to return capital to shareholders with a dividend of $0.15 per share declared on August 6th. Overall, we're satisfied with our results.
Turning to operations, the metric we are most enthusiastic about is customer relationships. We gained 5,000 total customers, marking the first quarter of growth in more than two years. New technologies and consumer behaviors continue to challenge the big bundle. It's clear that the dynamic with the customers is changing, which is why today the overall customer relationship number is more relevant to individual product metrics.
As a leading service provider in the most sophisticated markets in the country, we saw these trends coming. And that is why earlier this year, we were the first and only provider to introduce cord cutter packages. We recognize that the traditional video bundle does not work for all consumers, so we are offering flexibility, choice and new products to meet their evolving connectivity needs.

We have been positioning the company to address this changing market for several years. Beginning in 2012, Cablevision embarked on a new strategic path to become the premier connectivity company in the New York market. We made substantial investments in technology, tools and people to provide the best experience to our customers.
Most importantly, we focused on the reliability and performance of our network. As a result, we more than doubled our broadband capacity, optimized the density and quality of our WiFi experience, enabled a more innovative product set with flexible service offerings and improved our ability to monitor network performance and address issues proactively. These investments have also made our operations more efficient. We have reduced trouble call truck rolls in half and customer calls by nearly 30% compared to the 2012 levels. This has led to lower cost and improved customer satisfaction.
At the same time, we chose to compete on value, not solely on price by taking a more disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and customer credit policies. The changes in the way we do business have resulted in a stronger base of customers who are more satisfied. That has helped decrease our voluntary competitive churn to a nearly six-year low in the second quarter.
On the product side, we've continued to innovate with our over-the-top offerings and recent speed increase in our core data service. We have also changed the Cablevision employee experience by investing in the development of our people. As a result, we have created a performance-based culture throughout all levels of the company.
I'm going to close my portion of the call with some remarks about Verizon. Our first direct competition with them was in the landline phone business. From a standing start, we took more than 2 million of their residential phone customers and Cablevision became a dominant phone provider in our market. Verizon has invested billions of dollars in FiOS in the tri-state area. Today, Cablevision service more than 3.1 million customers, down from 3.3 million customers at our peak in 2008. This is despite FiOS' heavily-funded overbuild and deeply discounted pricing, as well as the economy and other competitive forces.
The impact of FiOS on Cablevision has been minimal. To the extent that we have lost customers to FiOS, we believe that they are usually promotional shoppers in search of the lowest priced services. FiOS has almost certainly performed better against the satellite companies than it has against Cablevision. We believe that the Verizon FiOS is an unprofitable business today and we doubt that they will ever be profitable.
Our strategic plan and investments during the past three years have helped to transform Cablevision. Our focus on price discipline has allowed us to grow revenue per customer. Our voluntary churn is down and we have retained our highest value customers. In addition, today Cablevision operates the nation's most robust WiFi network while Verizon has no public WiFi.
Cablevision has changed its culture. We no longer think like a monopoly, and instead we are strategic, effective, and competitive. Our approach to connectivity as a new frontier is gaining traction. This is reflected by our growth in customer relationships this quarter. The Verizon FiOS effect, if there ever was one, in our opinion is over. Our business is healthy and I'm confident that it will get even stronger as we move forward.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kristin Dolan for an operational and product update.
Kristin A. Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thank you, Jim. The actions we've taken over the last three years to reimagine Cablevision have resulted in a faster, more reliable network that excels at delivering new and sophisticated products and services. Expanding on Jim's update, the improvements we have made have enhanced the customer experience and have reduced costly service-related transactions.

For example, through proactive monitoring of the network, we're able to identify risk points and intervene before the customer is affected. We triage every trouble call before we roll a truck, identifying the source of the issue and eliminating unnecessary truck rolls. And we've armed our technicians with advanced tools that enable faster repair times and facilitate the goal of first call resolution, solving the problem in our first visit to the home. These initiatives are resonating with our customers and leading to a superior service experience. Accordingly, second quarter trouble call truck rolls decreased 19% as compared with the prior year period. We also experienced a 13% reduction in calls to customer service over the same period.
We implemented a Voice of the Customer dashboard earlier this year to capture real-time customer feedback and measure Net Promoter Score, a tool widely used by many leading companies to obtain feedback from customers. Responses to this new approach have been strong. We'll harness the insights from these surveys to further improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiencies.
We've also continued to innovate in the product area. In the second quarter, we introduced our cord cutter packages to serve a new generation that prefers to access video content through the Internet. The cord cutter offerings provide access to different levels of Internet service at varying price points. They all include a digital antenna at no charge for over-the-air TV. This allows customers to bypass the big bundle and still watch broadcast television as well as over-the-top content. These packages are attracting new interest. They have also allowed us to engage differently with consumers who are looking for options to fit their individual connectivity needs and budgets.
Changes in our acquisition and retention practices helped improve customer activity during the quarter with fewer disconnects and an overall net gain of 5,000 total customers as Jim mentioned. We also experienced the largest quarterly data net additions since the first quarter of 2013.
Turning to our network, our investments in this area have transformed our high-speed data service into the premier broadband offering in the New York marketplace. Let me share a few statistics. During the last two years, average data usage per customer has increased by 190%. Today, 90% of customer relationships include broadband service. In addition, nearly half of Optimum Online customers currently subscribe to premium speed tiers and more than half of data customers use 50 gigabits or more per month.
Now let's turn to WiFi. Over the last three years, WiFi access and usage has grown exponentially across all metrics. For example, Optimum WiFi access points have increased from less than 50,000 to more than 1.3 million. We rolled out 1 million in-home smart routers at no incremental cost to our customers, and monthly WiFi data usage per customer increased from less than 1 gigabyte to more than 6 gigabytes over the same three-year period. We will continue to make investments in our WiFi network through the deployment of additional WiFi access points in high data usage areas.
Moving on, other highlights for the quarter include offering HBO NOW and Hulu as over-the-top alternatives for our broadband customers, entering into a long-term agreement with ESPN Disney for our data and analytics service, and continuing to work with other MSOs to provide combined insights from set-top box tuning data. We're pleased with our progress in the first half of 2015 and will remain focused on delivering superior service and enhancing our customer relationships.
With that, let me turn to Brian Sweeney to review our financial results.
Brian G. Sweeney - President and Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. During the quarter, total customers increased by 5,000 and high-speed data customers increased by 14,000. Video and voice customers declined by 16,000 and 7,000, respectively. We're seeing more favorable customer trends over the last few quarters as a direct result of the numerous actions taken to increase broadband capacity, improve network reliability and enhance customer service. We have also built a stronger customer base with reduced churn and lower voluntary disconnects.
Average monthly revenue per customer in the second quarter increased by nearly $6 to $158.52, as compared with the prior year period. This performance was principally driven by recent rate initiatives and our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and retention policies, as well as increased transactional revenue from a pay-per-view event during the quarter.
Second quarter total Cable revenue increased by 1.8%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customers compared to the prior year period and lower advertising. Cable AOCF decreased 3.4% in the second quarter as compared with the prior year period. This primarily reflects higher programming costs, legal fees and product development and marketing costs, partially offset by the impact of revenue growth and lower customer service-related costs.
I want to provide a little more color on our advertising business. As compared with 2014, second quarter Cable advertising revenue decreased by 11% primarily due to reduced political spending with fewer candidate campaigns this year along with lower spending in the financial, gaming and cable programming sectors. The declines in certain categories of our advertising revenue were offset in part by higher local, recreational and consumer spending. Notably, the number of addressable advertising campaigns doubled compared to the prior year period, and we are seeing pronounced interest in impression-based sales.
Moving on to CapEx, Cable capital spending in the second quarter was $186 million, a $21 million decrease from the same period in 2014. This primarily reflects lower year-over-year spending on set-top box and modem purchases, as well as the timing of certain video-related projects. These declines were partially offset by higher project spending to support broadband and WiFi expansion. We expect increased CapEx spending in the back half of 2015 as we continue to invest in the evolution of our product offerings and ensure a quality service experience.
Moving on to our other business segments; Lightpath's second quarter revenue increased 3% and AOCF grew nearly 12% as compared with the prior year period. The revenue increase reflects growth in Ethernet-based services, partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services. AOCF growth was also driven by lower expenses.
In our Other segment, second quarter revenue decreased 3.7% and the AOCF deficit increased by 4%. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower advertising revenue at Newsday, partially offset by higher advertising revenue at News 12. The decline in AOCF reflects lower overall net revenues and higher employee-related costs at corporate, partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses at Newsday.
Now turning to the company's financial position; the company's second quarter consolidated cash position was $797 million and net debt was $7.7 billion. We had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings as of the end of the second quarter. As previously mentioned on our May earnings call, during the second quarter, we made a voluntary repayment of our CSC Holdings term loan B facility in the amount of $200 million. This repayment will result in cash interest savings over the term of the facility. We remain focused on identifying opportunities to reduce leverage, strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position.

At June 30th, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.1 times. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group bank leverage ratio was 2.7 times. We have not repurchased shares of Cablevision stock during 2015, and we have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization. We continue to anticipate that 2015 total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for new product initiatives will be substantially similar to our 2014 results.
Before we move to Q&A, we know the topic of M&A continues to be on all of your minds. But this call is to discuss our second quarter results. We will not be entertaining questions today relating to industry consolidation.
Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And your first question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jessica J. Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Oh, thank you. I've got two questions. The first one, I just wanted – I hope to follow-up on what Kristin was just talking about on the video bundle. Kristin, can you give any color on – you guys offer more choice in different packages. This is obviously the – I mean, given what's happened in the last few days and the fears that the bundle is falling apart and your experience, can you tell us like who's taking the non-traditional packages, the skinny packages? How quickly are you seeing customers to pick – go down and move down from the big video packages, traditional video packages to the skinny bundles?
Kristin A. Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
So, let me start by saying that the skinny bundle – let me talk about it differently, sorry. The cord cutting packages are definitely making the phone ring, but the bulk of people are still buying three products. And the cord cutter packages are really going to new acquisitions, to customers that we wouldn't normally get. So, we're not seeing a migration of existing products moving to cord cutters or to skinnier bundles. We're really, I think, attracting new customers and also making the phone ring with the price point associated and then up-selling the bulk of those customers to a traditional three-product bundle.
Jessica J. Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
So, I guess just to follow up, do you guys have a point of view on how quickly the traditional bundle will – how much in terms of – I'm sorry...
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I do.
Jessica J. Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Jessica.
Jessica J. Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, Jim.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't think the sky is falling quite yet. And I think that there's not enough programming weight yet in the Internet, right, and then the over-the-top services that are out there to really entice a mainstream video customer, right, you're going to see innovators, et cetera, some of the, I won't call them fringe, but some of the not mainstream video watchers start to adopt the over-the-top.
I do think eventually though that there will be enough programming for over-the-top to be competitive with the traditional video bundle. But this is not something that I think is going to happen over a very short period of time. The consumers have become very, very comfortable with the amount of choices that cable offers, and if you want to have a very, very wide variety of choice, the bundle actually is somewhat still efficient.
It's essentially buying the entire magazine stand, even though you're going to – because you want the choice of every magazine in there, but you only look at maybe several a day or whatever, but you don't want to give up your access to the whole magazine stand. The consumers have gotten very used to that, but it's pricey.

And so, as you continue to see that price push up which inevitably you will because the programmers are raising their rates obviously on a regular basis, particularly the broadcasters who see it as a bit of a pot of gold. That will drive their people who are more price sensitive into alternatives, and Internet is obviously, IP over-the-top is starting to become a real alternative. And then that is why we introduced the cord cutter package with the digital antenna because the digital antenna essentially takes the programming bundle up to the point where it is somewhat competitive with the traditional bundle and at a price that's affordable.
So yes, I think it's right for you to watch what happens with that, but I don't think that we're going to see a landslide of consumers move from one to the other. And my own prediction is that it will be at least five years for 10% of the market to move and 10 years for 30% of the market to move.
Jessica J. Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
How's that for an answer?
Jessica J. Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. Can I just ask one different question which is when would you reconsider reinstating the share repurchase program?
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman
Jessica, we view the dividend as the primary form of return of capital to our shareholders. The original repurchase programs were put in place at a time when we had transactions that for one reason or another provided additional liquidity such as the spin-off of AMC which provided a lot of liquidity for share repurchase. But I think now the board is quite comfortable with the dividend being the primary return of capital. I'm not going to rule it out. But we'd look at it only on an opportunistic basis at this point in time. We've been reinvesting in the business, paying the dividend, and deleveraging. Those are the primary uses of capital.
Jessica J. Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I have one for Jim and just a quick one for Brian. Jim, on, you have repositioned the company as a connectivity company as you said and the subscriber numbers are showing that's been quite successful. Interestingly, Verizon seems to be going a little bit in the opposite direction with their Go90 product where they're actually getting into the programming business. So, when you guys look at your product suite and all the innovation that you've got there which again seems to be resonating nicely, do you ever think about getting into a mobile programming package business or do you think that's just the wrong strategy? And then, Brian, I'm just wondering if you could talk about the pay-per-view impact in the quarter for us given it was an unusually popular fight, so we could understand that. Thanks.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I'm actually going to pass that one over to Kristin because that's really her, that's her sweet spot area.
Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Sure.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So, go ahead. Did you get the question?
Kristin A. Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yes. No. I didn't know if Brian was going to go first. We've had programming entities in the past that we've spun. We understand the business really well. I think it's a crowded marketplace right now, where I think they have seen success is, things like having Major League Baseball available on an exclusive basis to mobile customers. It's a really expensive proposition. I don't think necessarily that it's additive to our overall strategy. I don't think it generates incremental revenue particularly. And our focus is really on delivering the product, having the best service and the best pipeline to deliver whatever anybody wants to buy from us or from over-the-top providers. So, I don't see the mobile content strategy as being one that would really be critical to us, to our overall approach.

James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think that the mobile carriers are trying to differentiate themselves, because they don't have much to differentiate themselves. I mean, that's why they're investing in that kind of thing. But I think it's really all about mobile revenue, right. It's not about a new product set. It's about winning the battle against a competitor for them.
Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes. Makes sense.
Brian G. Sweeney - President and Chief Financial Officer
So, Ben, on the pay-per-view question, that fight was actually the most successful pay-per-view that we ever had. So, it did have a meaningful contribution on revenue. I think on a AOCF basis, it contributed about $5 million of AOCF during the quarter. We're also quite pleased that with all the enhancements that we've put in the network, that we didn't have any customer service issues in dealing with the huge interest that was in that fight.
Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo.
Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks. I have two. Jim, when you talked about Verizon at the beginning, you often get asked on these calls if there's been any change in competition, and normally the answer is no. So when you come out with such a strong commentary, is it that competition is actually getting easier? I mean, FiOS didn't put up the best numbers or is Cablevision just that much stronger? That's the first question.
And then the second question, do you envision as video subs go down, whatever it is, 10% or 30%, that you can make all of that up in high-speed data pricing and tiers? Or is it your vision that at some point you're in a – or the industry is in a secular decline? Thanks.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. The first one was about – I'm getting old. I'm sorry. What was the first question about?
Brian G. Sweeney - President and Chief Financial Officer
Verizon.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
That's right. Verizon.
Kristin A. Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Verizon.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Oh. Yes. No, thank you. Great. I turned 60 this year; that's my excuse. I really see Cablevision having over the last three years focused very heavily on our culture and our attitude here about how we do business. And we saw ourselves back three years ago, four years ago as really being a sort of operating in the form of a classic cable company, which is really a monopoly. I know that some in the industry don't like to call themselves that. But if you're the only provider, that sort of makes you the monopoly. We're clearly not the only provider in our marketplace, and it was time for us to recognize that.
But just recognizing it doesn't change you overnight, it's taken us a good 3.5 years to get ourselves in a position where we are truly effective competitors and we address the realities of the marketplace. What I said today is a reflection of Cablevision's strength and I think the numbers bear that out quite nicely. And I expect that we will get only stronger as a competitor. And so, that's really the basis of my comments on that.
Other than that, I think we do find it at least a little annoying over here that Verizon continues to tout its FiOS product as being successful when we know very well that that is definitely not the case at least in our footprint. And they refuse to break out their numbers. And so they just sit there and beat their chest saying, yes, I am, yes, I am. And everything that we see says no, they aren't. So, there's a little bit of that in there.

The second part of your question was on the bundle and the erosion of the bundle. And I do see our ability actually to make up for loss of video customers. But you should understand that video customers actually are not the most valuable customers. By far, in a way, data customers are the most valuable customers at a ratio here of close to 7 to 1. And so, as we continue to improve our ability to offer connectivity to our customers, I do expect that our suite of offerings to them will increase, that there'll be more revenue opportunities in there for specialized use, as well as expanded use.
And use, by the way, continues to grow exponentially. And so, the outlook for data is very strong. And with video, their margins continue to decrease and our intention is to ultimately be able to offer to our customers, not only our video package but other's videos packages versus an IP connection and further reduce our costs, but improve the profitability of the company that way.
Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.
Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC
Hi. Jimmy, I wonder if we could continue just with this same theme for a second. As someone who is an owner of assets in the physical distribution business but also AMC's content and MSG Sports. How do you think about where value is going to be created in the value chain within the assets that you own and how is that evolving as you start to think about skinny bundles on your side of the distribution business?
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Craig. Hey, Craig, let me ask you a favor please, right. Only my mother calls me Jimmy. So, I appreciate if you call me Jim.
Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC
You got it Jim.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Right. And as far as the value chain, today is a call about Cablevision, right. I will be doing a call about Madison Square Garden I think later in the month. But I think the value equation here is just what I just said in my last answer. I mean, it's in the data services. It's in the – we have gone over the last 10 years from a point where our customers valued video as the – that was the most important product and that was the decisive product in terms of choosing providers.
Now, it's data and it's connectivity. And it's not just connectivity to the home, but it's wireless connectivity. And the ability to offer products and services in both areas in both at home and mobile-y is where we're focusing. And along with that, I think that we will be able to distinguish ourselves, to separate ourselves from our competitors and be able to charge a premium for services that really only we provide.
Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC
Can I ask a follow-up question about your 7 to 1 ratio that you said for the value of customers? What's the solution to that? Is it to say we're going to be very selective for which customers within video we take or is it to say we're going to re-price video in order to ensure that for the customers that we have that it's profitable, or is it simply to shift away from video and pare back expenses including potentially dropping some programming in order to sort of right-size the cost side of the video equation?
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't know about the programming part, Craig. But video is turning into, if it isn't already, the milk, eggs, and bread of the convenience store. You have to have them, right. The customer wants them, right. But it's not as I said before, it's not the most important product, right. Data is the most important product. But if you just offer data alone, right, the other providers who offer video would capture the customer because you have to sell milk, bread and eggs along with everything else in the back of the store.

Now, we, by far, in a way, have the best back of the store. And the milk, bread and eggs should just need to make sure they stay fresh and they're equal to what's available out there and to what the most customers want. So, that means you don't have to carry every service, it's – you don't have to be on the cutting edge of every technology that has to do with video because customers don't necessarily always want those. You can keep your cost down and you can try and maintain some level of margin, right. But over the long run, it's the back of the store that's going to make you profitable.
Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC

Thank you. Your next question comes from Amy Yong of Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Thanks. I wanted to focus a little bit more on the cord cutting packages. I know it's early days, but are there any take rates that you can talk to for Hulu and HBO? And I think, Kristin, you mentioned in your earlier comments that most customers are still taking the triple-play package. So, are these cord cutting packages just drumming up call center volumes or are people actually taking them? And if they are, is it because of economic or generational shifts in viewing? Thank you.
Kristin A. Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
So, yes, just to repeat, Amy, what I said before, you are correct. They do make the phone ring. The bulk of people are being up-sold into triple-product bundles. We do see, like I said, acquisitions. So, Millennials are definitely interested in cord cutting packages. And we're actually happy on the lower end cord cutting package that we're allowing people in more financially conservative situations to have access to Internet and to broadcast television. And to kind of go back a little bit to Craig's question about expense; we are able to see, too, that the broadband-only customers require much lower level of service from us. They call us less and our need to roll trucks against them are less.
So, combining those two things, we're very positive on the opportunity to sell this type of package. But it's really – it's fringe. It's people that we haven't had before, and again, the attractiveness of it makes the phone ring but again to the bread-and-eggs model, when people do call and we say okay in order to get that price, these are the programming services you'll get. And when they see that they're missing a lot of their core fundamental cable TV content, they much prefer to go to a more traditional television package.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Great. And then you mentioned that CapEx is going to bump up in the back half. Can you just speak to the magnitude of the bump-up and where are the bigger buckets of CapEx spend at this point? Looks like CPE and scalable infrastructure actually went down in the quarter. So just wondering what you're actually investing in?
Brian G. Sweeney - President and Chief Financial Officer
So just as a comment, our guidance for the year is that CapEx spending is expected to be substantially similar to what it was last year, and so I think what you've seen in terms of lower CapEx this quarter year-to-date is more just timing of projects, timing of CPE purchases, and so we still expect to, for total CapEx spending to be comparable to last year.
I think relative to why we're lower relative to last year, as examples, we had higher investment in scalable infrastructure last year as we were doing investments in our cloud DVR services where we've had lower of that this year. Relative to first quarter, why it being up, basically it's timing. It's set-top box purchases and just higher spending on overall bandwidth augmentation to support the higher speeds that we put in place.

Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Morris of Guggenheim Partners.
Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Thank you. Good morning, guys. My question is about how you think about the over-the-top offerings from companies that you pay for the same content. So an example, not specific to this, but an example would be CBS All Access, where their over-the-top product looks extremely similar to what you pay retransmission fees for. So I guess generally speaking for these types of offerings, do your agreements allow for this? I know you don't speak to specific agreements, but just generally, is this something you feel the need or you try to protect yourself against when you do go into an agreement? And in the future, if somebody launches something like this, do you expect more flexibility with respect to being able to maybe tier those networks or drop them from the bundle? How do you think about that dynamic in terms of protecting your own investment in the programming? Thanks.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well first off, our focus first and foremost is the customer and we don't believe that anywhere in our task is directing the customer one way or another. So, when CBS comes out with an over-the-top package, et cetera, right, that's more choice for our customer, right. They're still going to use our service to get it and so we really don't have that much difficulty with that and there are plenty of others that are doing over-the-top services too. Remember if you heard earlier, I mean the video product itself is, what our biggest concern is that the customer have available to them a video product that they like, at a price that they can afford.
And so whether they get that through our big bundle or whether they get that through our cord cutter package which allows them to get, for instance, CBS for free. To us, what's most important is that they're satisfied. And we focus on providing the best connectivity to them, so they can access all of those products. But we don't see ourselves as trying to stop the flow of over-the-top programming to our customers. That isn't something that we're very interested in doing. And what was the other part of your question, or was there?
Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Well, maybe I'll ask the question more bluntly. Let's take something like ESPN, which is obviously an expensive programming cost for you.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Right.
Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC
And they're talking about at some point going over-the-top. So, if they launch an over-the-top service, would you expect to still pay full price for that in your most broadly distributed bundle or would you say if you're going to make that available direct, perhaps we should at least be able to tier it out of our most basic package or give our customers more options?
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No. We don't think like that. It's basically it's the same answer. I mean look, if ESPN does offers an over-the-top service, right, and one of our customers takes the ESPN over-the-top service, right, then the likelihood is that they're not a bundle subscriber, right. They're more like the – they're for sure going to be a data subscriber because they're going to need the connectivity especially for that kind of programming, right. And they could very well have the digital antenna, et cetera. And they're still our customer, and that's what we want.
Remember, it's on a per customer basis that ESPN charges. So, as long as they're pricing – if they under-price us and go to the consumer with a lesser price than what they're getting from us, which by the way I can't imagine why they would do that, because they're just decreasing their overall revenue, right. But if they did that, I could see us possibly going back to them and saying, hey look, you know we need to at least even up here.

But other than that, we don't have a problem with it because for us, it's not about capturing the video customer, it's about connectivity. And we ultimately expect that customers will be getting – a good portion of our customers will be getting their video product from over-the-top. It may take five years to 10 years, but that is the way things are going to happen. And we think that what we really want the customer to think is that the best way to get that, the very best way to get that is with Cablevision, by using our connectivity product.
Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC
That's very helpful. Thanks, Jim.
James Lawrence Dolan - Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks. Two if I may. First, it's nice to see RGUs do better. I'm curious how much of that strength you think is seasonal versus more sustainable? And if you could talk about the seasonality of the business overall, especially your more seasonal second-home market, I'm curious if you've seen the seasonality of video connects in 2Q and 3Q disconnects fade, as well as seeing a less seasonal variation in HSD as people keep these homes lit up with broadband year round.
Kristin A. Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
So, I'd just say to that, overall, the impact of seasonality on our business has really declined over the last few years. So, I wouldn't say it's completely flat but the peaks and valleys have definitely have gotten smaller over the years. So, we don't see it as a huge impact. We do see fewer moves this year than anticipated. But really our overall – what makes us happy is just the level of voluntary churn and being at such a significant low. But the seasonality I think plays less and less of an impact over time.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then second, at the risk of using myself as an example, as a Cablevision customer I've been surprised by the difference in quality of Netflix and HBO NOW, where I get a lot of buffering on HBO, almost none on Netflix. I assume it's because Netflix has a direct connection into your network. Is there any momentum to do this with others like Hulu or HBO or others? And when could your network be ready for a fully functional over-the-top partnership that Jim alluded to?
Wilt Hildenbrand - Senior Advisor, Cablevision Systems Corp.
It's Wilt. Well Netflix certainly has a direct connect and that is one of the benefits, although the benefits of direct connect takes the Internet out of the equation and just uses our local network, right, the pipe going through your house to deliver the service. Why HBO would be working any less than Netflix, we might want to check out your house, the drop to your house or your house itself because there's no endemic reason for it to be that way. If Netflix is running well on the local area network, then HBO and everything else should be running just as well. I mean, Netflix there is the barometer. So, I think you might have something going on in your neighborhood because it shouldn't be any different. Would you like to give us your phone number and street address?
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
I'll give it right here on the line. Thank you, guys.
Cindi Buckwalter - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations
Operator, we'll take one more question, please.

Thank you. Your final question will come from James Ratcliffe of Buckingham Research.
James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Thanks for taking the question. Two on the cost structure if I could. First of all, you called out an increase in legal fees as a drain on AOCF in the quarter. Can you give us some really to size that and if that's expected to be recurring step-up or a one-time? And secondly, if we look at the Other category, any way to break out how much of the AOCF deficit there is really driven by the businesses in that category and how much is corporate overhead? Thanks.

Brian G. Sweeney - President and Chief Financial Officer
So, on the legal fees, higher legal fees that we're seeing this year, are just related to matters that we're dealing with relative to programmers, labor, false advertising, et cetera. We're not going to give any guidance on that. That's part of being in a competitive environment and our environment with the programmers. Relative to your question on deficit in the AOCF...
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman
The Other category.
Brian G. Sweeney - President and Chief Financial Officer
...in the Other category. I think, more of that increase is probably on the – hold on one second.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman
It's not corporate overhead. That's what he's asking. No, it's the other.
James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
I'm just asking if there's a way to sort of break up that AOCF deficit between the sort of the businesses where the revenues included in Other and otherwise on unallocated costs.
Brian G. Sweeney - President and Chief Financial Officer
No. I don't think there's no real – I think each of them had small components of it. There's not one that's overwhelming relative to the others.
James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
All right. Thank you.

James L. Dolan (born May 11, 1955) is an American businessman who serves as Executive Chairman of Madison Square Garden Company and MSG Networks.[1] As the company's chairman, Dolan oversees all operations within the company and also supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams, the New York Knicks, New York Rangers, and New York Liberty, as well as their regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. Dolan previously served as CEO of Cablevision until its sale in June 2016.

Personal life
Family
Dolan is married and resides on Long Island with his wife. He is the son of Cablevision founder Charles Dolan and nephew of Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan. Dolan's two brothers, Patrick and Thomas, serve on Cablevision's Board of Directors. Dolan is of Irish descent.[2]
Early life
After originally pursuing a career in music, Dolan eventually switched to a major in communications at SUNY New Paltz and began working for Cablevision in various capacities including sales before eventually being dispatched to Cleveland by his father to manage the launching of a sports radio station. In 1995, he was made CEO of Cablevision.
Drug and alcohol abuse
Throughout his early adult life, Dolan battled drug and alcohol problems and was reportedly known for having a volatile temper. In 1993, he went to drug rehabilitation at the Hazelden clinic in Center City, Minnesota.[3]
Hobbies
Dolan performs blues-inspired rock as the singer for JD & The Straight Shot and is also an avid sailor.
Business management
Dolan was an ardent opponent of his father's proposed Voom satellite service, which became a polarizing controversy among Cablevision's Board of Directors. While supporters argued Voom could propel Cablevision into the future emerging satellite market and a wider customer base, opponents of the plan, including James Dolan, argued it was too expensive with no expense relief for the foreseeable future. In the end, the younger Dolan prevailed and Voom was shut down. This was an instrumental event in Dolan emerging from his father's shadow, albeit reluctantly, as a viable businessman.[4]
However, his business career has not been without failures, which include purchasing the failing Wiz electronics and entertainment chain which ended up posting losses of $250 million before being liquidated and the Clearview Cinemas chain which has failed to generate any significant revenue.[5]
Philanthropy
Dolan is also dedicated to Cablevision's philanthropic partnership with The Lustgarten Foundation, the nation's largest private supporter of pancreatic cancer research. Together with Charles Dolan and former Cablevision Vice Chairman and Madison Square Garden Chairman Marc Lustgarten.[6] Dolan established the Foundation in 1998. In 2008, Cablevision made a multi-year commitment to underwrite the Foundation's costs, ensuring that 100 percent of every donation goes directly to researching this deadly disease.[7] With Dolan's backing, Cablevision also uses its assets to advance the curePC campaign, aimed at increasing public awareness of pancreatic cancer, and is responsible for organizing the Holiday Rock & Roll Bash, the Foundation's biggest annual fundraiser.[8][9]
Dolan also led MSG's response to local and national tragedies. He played a principal role in organizing the recent "12-12-12" benefit concert, which raised an initial $50 million for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, with additional money still coming in.[10] Other extraordinary benefit concerts have included "The Concert For New York City," which generated more than $35 million in aid for 9/11 victims and heroes, and "From The Big Apple to The Big Easy," which raised nearly $9 million for Hurricane Katrina relief.[11] Dolan also supports MSG's ongoing commitment to the community, particularly through the Garden of Dreams Foundation, the non-profit charity that partners with MSG to help children facing obstacles throughout the New York metropolitan area.[12]
Sports management
In 1994, Paramount Communications, the owner of Madison Square Garden, was acquired by Viacom, who in turn sold the MSG properties to Cablevision and ITT Corporation, which had 50% ownership each. ITT sold its share to Cablevision three years later.
In 1999, Dolan was given an increased role in managing Cablevision's sports properties and is now the primary manager of these assets. The teams under his domain include most notably the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks, the National Hockey League's New York Rangers, the Women's National Basketball Association's New York Liberty, and the American Hockey League's Hartford Wolf Pack.
As Chairman of Madison Square Garden, he supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams and regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. He also serves as a governor of the Knicks and Rangers to their respective leagues.
Controversies
New York Knicks
Like the Rangers, the Knicks performed abysmally in the early 2000s and have yet to recover, which fans mostly blame on Dolan's management missteps. Although the Knicks made the NBA Finals in 1999, they have not posted a winning season until the 2012-2013 season. Furthermore, the Knicks had not made the playoffs from the 2003-2004 season to the 2010-2011 season, which both ended in first round four game sweeps for the Knicks. Dolan has come under fire from many Knicks' fans for the team's run of consecutive losing seasons from 2001-2002 to 2009-2010. Numerous media[who?] and informal fan polls, including a recent Sports Illustrated poll, have ranked Dolan the worst owner in the NBA.[13] In 2007, NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Dolan's management of the Knicks, saying "they're not a model of intelligent management."[14][15] One widely criticized decision was to give shooting guard Allan Houston a 6-year, $100 million maximum contract in 2001, when no other team had offered Houston more than $75 million. Houston retired due to injury after just four seasons and with over $40 million remaining on his contract.
In 2003, Dolan hired Isiah Thomas as Team President of Basketball Operations and General Manager to replace embattled executive Scott Layden. Thomas made aggressive moves to re-tool and upgrade the Knicks roster through trades, the NBA Draft, and free agency. Despite the talent Thomas imported, the team did not perform up to expectations and Thomas was often the target of the frustration of Knick fans; Dolan was also on the receiving end of the ire of Knicks' fans for his commitment to Thomas in spite of Thomas' sometimes questionable decisions.
After the 2004-2005 season, the Knicks signed head coach Larry Brown to a 5-year, $50 million contract. After just one (losing) season, Brown was fired and the team bought-out Brown's contract for $18 million. Brown walked away with a total of $28 million for coaching the Knicks for just one year.
After firing Larry Brown, Isiah Thomas assumed the duties of being the head coach of the Knicks. During a staged interview on MSG Network, which is the last time Dolan answered questions from the media, Dolan gave Thomas an ultimatum to show "evident progress" or potentially be fired. In the latter half of the 2006-2007 season, with the Knicks within reach of a playoff spot, Dolan signed Thomas to a multi-year contract extension. The team subsequently fell out of contention and Dolan was castigated in many quarters for his extension of Thomas' contract. The next season, Dolan stripped Thomas of his front office duties because Thomas had taken the Knicks to the playoffs just once during his tenure. New team President Donnie Walsh removed Thomas as head coach upon the conclusion of the season.
Other coaches that also had short-lived tenures as head coaches of the Knicks include Don Chaney (2001–2003) and Lenny Wilkens (2003–2005). Like Thomas and Brown, they remained on the Knicks' payroll following their departure from the bench due to multi-year contracts signed with the owner (and in Chaney's case, 2 separate contract extensions).
In 2007, Dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former Knicks executive, Anucha Browne-Sanders. Browne-Sanders accused Dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from Isiah Thomas. The court ruled in favor of Brown-Sanders and Dolan had to pay $3 million of the $11 million settlement. MSG was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement.[16]
In July 2012, Dolan faced criticism for allowing popular Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin to sign with the Houston Rockets without matching their $25.1 million offer.[17]
In February 2015, Dolan responded to a letter from Irving Bierman, a 73-year-old, lifelong Knicks fan, that criticized Dolan's ownership of the Knicks and questioned his leadership with a seething letter of his own, telling the fan to "root for the Nets because the Knicks don't want you" and that Bierman was "a sad person" and probably an "alcoholic maybe".,[18][19][20] Dolan later addressed the issue with the press, but did not apologize, only saying the letter was a case of "tit for tat" and declaring the incident "over".,[21][22] Newly appointed NBA Commissioner Adam Silver did not reprimand or penalize Dolan, but instead further brushed the incident under the rug by calling Dolan a "consummate New Yorker” who received "an unkind email and responded with an unkind email”.,[23][24]
On February 9, 2017, former Knicks player Charles Oakley was removed from Madison Square Garden during a Knicks–Clippers game following an altercation with MSG security. Oakley contends that Dolan has ignored, if not ostracized, him.[25][26][27]
New York Rangers
After winning the Stanley Cup in 1994, the Rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of Dolan's increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the 1997-1998 season until the 2004–05 NHL lockout, despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years. This was the longest playoff drought in the franchise's history, in part due to questionable, expensive free-agent signings, such as Eric Lindros, Pavel Bure, and Theo Fleury. Despite fan and media calls for the team's general manager Glen Sather to be fired for the organization's shortcomings, Sather was retained. However, since the resolution of the NHL lockout in 2005, Dolan has allowed Sather to rebuild from the ground up, which has led to a revival of the club and the organization, culminating with a trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 2012, their first since 1997. However, when Dolan spoke of the team's Stanley Cup chances in January 2012, Rangers head coach John Tortorella took issue with his remarks. "I have my owner up here talking about a Stanley Cup. That's a bunch of bullshit," Tortorella said in response. "We need to take it one game at a time."[28]
New York Liberty
On May 5, 2015 Dolan announced that Isiah Thomas would serve as president of the WNBA’s Liberty. Considering Thomas' history being both a failed President/GM of the Knicks and Thomas being implicated in the Anucha Browne-Sanders sexual harassment incident, it was questioned by many fans and members of the press.[29][30][31][32]
Media policies
Dolan rarely speaks with members of the media and communicates to the press through released statements or in interviews with MSG Network. In 2000, Dolan instituted media training for all Garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media.[33] Under Dolan's watch MSG implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players. Some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and Knicks' beat writers from interviewing players without an MSG public relations official present, forbidding one-on-one interviews, and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the organization. The policies also forbid the MSG Network from being critical of the Knicks and the Rangers, regardless of their performance. Such measures were not standard practice for other NBA teams.[34] In addition, the Knicks did not make their medical staff available to the press.[35] In 2004, longtime broadcaster Marv Albert's contract was not renewed by MSG Network, allegedly because of his criticism of the Knicks' play.[36][37]

Personal life
Family
Dolan is married and resides on Long Island with his wife. He is the son of Cablevision founder Charles Dolan and nephew of Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan. Dolan's two brothers, Patrick and Thomas, serve on Cablevision's Board of Directors. Dolan is of Irish descent.[2]
Early life
After originally pursuing a career in music, Dolan eventually switched to a major in communications at SUNY New Paltz and began working for Cablevision in various capacities including sales before eventually being dispatched to Cleveland by his father to manage the launching of a sports radio station. In 1995, he was made CEO of Cablevision.
Drug and alcohol abuse
Throughout his early adult life, Dolan battled drug and alcohol problems and was reportedly known for having a volatile temper. In 1993, he went to drug rehabilitation at the Hazelden clinic in Center City, Minnesota.[3]
Hobbies
Dolan performs blues-inspired rock as the singer for JD & The Straight Shot and is also an avid sailor.
Business management
Dolan was an ardent opponent of his father's proposed Voom satellite service, which became a polarizing controversy among Cablevision's Board of Directors. While supporters argued Voom could propel Cablevision into the future emerging satellite market and a wider customer base, opponents of the plan, including James Dolan, argued it was too expensive with no expense relief for the foreseeable future. In the end, the younger Dolan prevailed and Voom was shut down. This was an instrumental event in Dolan emerging from his father's shadow, albeit reluctantly, as a viable businessman.[4]
However, his business career has not been without failures, which include purchasing the failing Wiz electronics and entertainment chain which ended up posting losses of $250 million before being liquidated and the Clearview Cinemas chain which has failed to generate any significant revenue.[5]
Philanthropy
Dolan is also dedicated to Cablevision's philanthropic partnership with The Lustgarten Foundation, the nation's largest private supporter of pancreatic cancer research. Together with Charles Dolan and former Cablevision Vice Chairman and Madison Square Garden Chairman Marc Lustgarten.[6] Dolan established the Foundation in 1998. In 2008, Cablevision made a multi-year commitment to underwrite the Foundation's costs, ensuring that 100 percent of every donation goes directly to researching this deadly disease.[7] With Dolan's backing, Cablevision also uses its assets to advance the curePC campaign, aimed at increasing public awareness of pancreatic cancer, and is responsible for organizing the Holiday Rock & Roll Bash, the Foundation's biggest annual fundraiser.[8][9]
Dolan also led MSG's response to local and national tragedies. He played a principal role in organizing the recent "12-12-12" benefit concert, which raised an initial $50 million for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, with additional money still coming in.[10] Other extraordinary benefit concerts have included "The Concert For New York City," which generated more than $35 million in aid for 9/11 victims and heroes, and "From The Big Apple to The Big Easy," which raised nearly $9 million for Hurricane Katrina relief.[11] Dolan also supports MSG's ongoing commitment to the community, particularly through the Garden of Dreams Foundation, the non-profit charity that partners with MSG to help children facing obstacles throughout the New York metropolitan area.[12]
Sports management
In 1994, Paramount Communications, the owner of Madison Square Garden, was acquired by Viacom, who in turn sold the MSG properties to Cablevision and ITT Corporation, which had 50% ownership each. ITT sold its share to Cablevision three years later.
In 1999, Dolan was given an increased role in managing Cablevision's sports properties and is now the primary manager of these assets. The teams under his domain include most notably the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks, the National Hockey League's New York Rangers, the Women's National Basketball Association's New York Liberty, and the American Hockey League's Hartford Wolf Pack.
As Chairman of Madison Square Garden, he supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams and regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. He also serves as a governor of the Knicks and Rangers to their respective leagues.
Controversies
New York Knicks
Like the Rangers, the Knicks performed abysmally in the early 2000s and have yet to recover, which fans mostly blame on Dolan's management missteps. Although the Knicks made the NBA Finals in 1999, they have not posted a winning season until the 2012-2013 season. Furthermore, the Knicks had not made the playoffs from the 2003-2004 season to the 2010-2011 season, which both ended in first round four game sweeps for the Knicks. Dolan has come under fire from many Knicks' fans for the team's run of consecutive losing seasons from 2001-2002 to 2009-2010. Numerous media[who?] and informal fan polls, including a recent Sports Illustrated poll, have ranked Dolan the worst owner in the NBA.[13] In 2007, NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Dolan's management of the Knicks, saying "they're not a model of intelligent management."[14][15] One widely criticized decision was to give shooting guard Allan Houston a 6-year, $100 million maximum contract in 2001, when no other team had offered Houston more than $75 million. Houston retired due to injury after just four seasons and with over $40 million remaining on his contract.
In 2003, Dolan hired Isiah Thomas as Team President of Basketball Operations and General Manager to replace embattled executive Scott Layden. Thomas made aggressive moves to re-tool and upgrade the Knicks roster through trades, the NBA Draft, and free agency. Despite the talent Thomas imported, the team did not perform up to expectations and Thomas was often the target of the frustration of Knick fans; Dolan was also on the receiving end of the ire of Knicks' fans for his commitment to Thomas in spite of Thomas' sometimes questionable decisions.
After the 2004-2005 season, the Knicks signed head coach Larry Brown to a 5-year, $50 million contract. After just one (losing) season, Brown was fired and the team bought-out Brown's contract for $18 million. Brown walked away with a total of $28 million for coaching the Knicks for just one year.
After firing Larry Brown, Isiah Thomas assumed the duties of being the head coach of the Knicks. During a staged interview on MSG Network, which is the last time Dolan answered questions from the media, Dolan gave Thomas an ultimatum to show "evident progress" or potentially be fired. In the latter half of the 2006-2007 season, with the Knicks within reach of a playoff spot, Dolan signed Thomas to a multi-year contract extension. The team subsequently fell out of contention and Dolan was castigated in many quarters for his extension of Thomas' contract. The next season, Dolan stripped Thomas of his front office duties because Thomas had taken the Knicks to the playoffs just once during his tenure. New team President Donnie Walsh removed Thomas as head coach upon the conclusion of the season.
Other coaches that also had short-lived tenures as head coaches of the Knicks include Don Chaney (2001–2003) and Lenny Wilkens (2003–2005). Like Thomas and Brown, they remained on the Knicks' payroll following their departure from the bench due to multi-year contracts signed with the owner (and in Chaney's case, 2 separate contract extensions).
In 2007, Dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former Knicks executive, Anucha Browne-Sanders. Browne-Sanders accused Dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from Isiah Thomas. The court ruled in favor of Brown-Sanders and Dolan had to pay $3 million of the $11 million settlement. MSG was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement.[16]
In July 2012, Dolan faced criticism for allowing popular Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin to sign with the Houston Rockets without matching their $25.1 million offer.[17]
In February 2015, Dolan responded to a letter from Irving Bierman, a 73-year-old, lifelong Knicks fan, that criticized Dolan's ownership of the Knicks and questioned his leadership with a seething letter of his own, telling the fan to "root for the Nets because the Knicks don't want you" and that Bierman was "a sad person" and probably an "alcoholic maybe".,[18][19][20] Dolan later addressed the issue with the press, but did not apologize, only saying the letter was a case of "tit for tat" and declaring the incident "over".,[21][22] Newly appointed NBA Commissioner Adam Silver did not reprimand or penalize Dolan, but instead further brushed the incident under the rug by calling Dolan a "consummate New Yorker” who received "an unkind email and responded with an unkind email”.,[23][24]
On February 9, 2017, former Knicks player Charles Oakley was removed from Madison Square Garden during a Knicks–Clippers game following an altercation with MSG security. Oakley contends that Dolan has ignored, if not ostracized, him.[25][26][27]
New York Rangers
After winning the Stanley Cup in 1994, the Rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of Dolan's increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the 1997-1998 season until the 2004–05 NHL lockout, despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years. This was the longest playoff drought in the franchise's history, in part due to questionable, expensive free-agent signings, such as Eric Lindros, Pavel Bure, and Theo Fleury. Despite fan and media calls for the team's general manager Glen Sather to be fired for the organization's shortcomings, Sather was retained. However, since the resolution of the NHL lockout in 2005, Dolan has allowed Sather to rebuild from the ground up, which has led to a revival of the club and the organization, culminating with a trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 2012, their first since 1997. However, when Dolan spoke of the team's Stanley Cup chances in January 2012, Rangers head coach John Tortorella took issue with his remarks. "I have my owner up here talking about a Stanley Cup. That's a bunch of bullshit," Tortorella said in response. "We need to take it one game at a time."[28]
New York Liberty
On May 5, 2015 Dolan announced that Isiah Thomas would serve as president of the WNBA’s Liberty. Considering Thomas' history being both a failed President/GM of the Knicks and Thomas being implicated in the Anucha Browne-Sanders sexual harassment incident, it was questioned by many fans and members of the press.[29][30][31][32]
Media policies
Dolan rarely speaks with members of the media and communicates to the press through released statements or in interviews with MSG Network. In 2000, Dolan instituted media training for all Garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media.[33] Under Dolan's watch MSG implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players. Some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and Knicks' beat writers from interviewing players without an MSG public relations official present, forbidding one-on-one interviews, and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the organization. The policies also forbid the MSG Network from being critical of the Knicks and the Rangers, regardless of their performance. Such measures were not standard practice for other NBA teams.[34] In addition, the Knicks did not make their medical staff available to the press.[35] In 2004, longtime broadcaster Marv Albert's contract was not renewed by MSG Network, allegedly because of his criticism of the Knicks' play.[36][37]

Personal life
Family
Dolan is married and resides on Long Island with his wife. He is the son of Cablevision founder Charles Dolan and nephew of Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan. Dolan's two brothers, Patrick and Thomas, serve on Cablevision's Board of Directors. Dolan is of Irish descent.[2]
Early life
After originally pursuing a career in music, Dolan eventually switched to a major in communications at SUNY New Paltz and began working for Cablevision in various capacities including sales before eventually being dispatched to Cleveland by his father to manage the launching of a sports radio station. In 1995, he was made CEO of Cablevision.
Drug and alcohol abuse
Throughout his early adult life, Dolan battled drug and alcohol problems and was reportedly known for having a volatile temper. In 1993, he went to drug rehabilitation at the Hazelden clinic in Center City, Minnesota.[3]
Hobbies
Dolan performs blues-inspired rock as the singer for JD & The Straight Shot and is also an avid sailor.
Business management
Dolan was an ardent opponent of his father's proposed Voom satellite service, which became a polarizing controversy among Cablevision's Board of Directors. While supporters argued Voom could propel Cablevision into the future emerging satellite market and a wider customer base, opponents of the plan, including James Dolan, argued it was too expensive with no expense relief for the foreseeable future. In the end, the younger Dolan prevailed and Voom was shut down. This was an instrumental event in Dolan emerging from his father's shadow, albeit reluctantly, as a viable businessman.[4]
However, his business career has not been without failures, which include purchasing the failing Wiz electronics and entertainment chain which ended up posting losses of $250 million before being liquidated and the Clearview Cinemas chain which has failed to generate any significant revenue.[5]
Philanthropy
Dolan is also dedicated to Cablevision's philanthropic partnership with The Lustgarten Foundation, the nation's largest private supporter of pancreatic cancer research. Together with Charles Dolan and former Cablevision Vice Chairman and Madison Square Garden Chairman Marc Lustgarten.[6] Dolan established the Foundation in 1998. In 2008, Cablevision made a multi-year commitment to underwrite the Foundation's costs, ensuring that 100 percent of every donation goes directly to researching this deadly disease.[7] With Dolan's backing, Cablevision also uses its assets to advance the curePC campaign, aimed at increasing public awareness of pancreatic cancer, and is responsible for organizing the Holiday Rock & Roll Bash, the Foundation's biggest annual fundraiser.[8][9]
Dolan also led MSG's response to local and national tragedies. He played a principal role in organizing the recent "12-12-12" benefit concert, which raised an initial $50 million for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, with additional money still coming in.[10] Other extraordinary benefit concerts have included "The Concert For New York City," which generated more than $35 million in aid for 9/11 victims and heroes, and "From The Big Apple to The Big Easy," which raised nearly $9 million for Hurricane Katrina relief.[11] Dolan also supports MSG's ongoing commitment to the community, particularly through the Garden of Dreams Foundation, the non-profit charity that partners with MSG to help children facing obstacles throughout the New York metropolitan area.[12]
Sports management
In 1994, Paramount Communications, the owner of Madison Square Garden, was acquired by Viacom, who in turn sold the MSG properties to Cablevision and ITT Corporation, which had 50% ownership each. ITT sold its share to Cablevision three years later.
In 1999, Dolan was given an increased role in managing Cablevision's sports properties and is now the primary manager of these assets. The teams under his domain include most notably the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks, the National Hockey League's New York Rangers, the Women's National Basketball Association's New York Liberty, and the American Hockey League's Hartford Wolf Pack.
As Chairman of Madison Square Garden, he supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams and regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. He also serves as a governor of the Knicks and Rangers to their respective leagues.
Controversies
New York Knicks
Like the Rangers, the Knicks performed abysmally in the early 2000s and have yet to recover, which fans mostly blame on Dolan's management missteps. Although the Knicks made the NBA Finals in 1999, they have not posted a winning season until the 2012-2013 season. Furthermore, the Knicks had not made the playoffs from the 2003-2004 season to the 2010-2011 season, which both ended in first round four game sweeps for the Knicks. Dolan has come under fire from many Knicks' fans for the team's run of consecutive losing seasons from 2001-2002 to 2009-2010. Numerous media[who?] and informal fan polls, including a recent Sports Illustrated poll, have ranked Dolan the worst owner in the NBA.[13] In 2007, NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Dolan's management of the Knicks, saying "they're not a model of intelligent management."[14][15] One widely criticized decision was to give shooting guard Allan Houston a 6-year, $100 million maximum contract in 2001, when no other team had offered Houston more than $75 million. Houston retired due to injury after just four seasons and with over $40 million remaining on his contract.
In 2003, Dolan hired Isiah Thomas as Team President of Basketball Operations and General Manager to replace embattled executive Scott Layden. Thomas made aggressive moves to re-tool and upgrade the Knicks roster through trades, the NBA Draft, and free agency. Despite the talent Thomas imported, the team did not perform up to expectations and Thomas was often the target of the frustration of Knick fans; Dolan was also on the receiving end of the ire of Knicks' fans for his commitment to Thomas in spite of Thomas' sometimes questionable decisions.
After the 2004-2005 season, the Knicks signed head coach Larry Brown to a 5-year, $50 million contract. After just one (losing) season, Brown was fired and the team bought-out Brown's contract for $18 million. Brown walked away with a total of $28 million for coaching the Knicks for just one year.
After firing Larry Brown, Isiah Thomas assumed the duties of being the head coach of the Knicks. During a staged interview on MSG Network, which is the last time Dolan answered questions from the media, Dolan gave Thomas an ultimatum to show "evident progress" or potentially be fired. In the latter half of the 2006-2007 season, with the Knicks within reach of a playoff spot, Dolan signed Thomas to a multi-year contract extension. The team subsequently fell out of contention and Dolan was castigated in many quarters for his extension of Thomas' contract. The next season, Dolan stripped Thomas of his front office duties because Thomas had taken the Knicks to the playoffs just once during his tenure. New team President Donnie Walsh removed Thomas as head coach upon the conclusion of the season.
Other coaches that also had short-lived tenures as head coaches of the Knicks include Don Chaney (2001–2003) and Lenny Wilkens (2003–2005). Like Thomas and Brown, they remained on the Knicks' payroll following their departure from the bench due to multi-year contracts signed with the owner (and in Chaney's case, 2 separate contract extensions).
In 2007, Dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former Knicks executive, Anucha Browne-Sanders. Browne-Sanders accused Dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from Isiah Thomas. The court ruled in favor of Brown-Sanders and Dolan had to pay $3 million of the $11 million settlement. MSG was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement.[16]
In July 2012, Dolan faced criticism for allowing popular Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin to sign with the Houston Rockets without matching their $25.1 million offer.[17]
In February 2015, Dolan responded to a letter from Irving Bierman, a 73-year-old, lifelong Knicks fan, that criticized Dolan's ownership of the Knicks and questioned his leadership with a seething letter of his own, telling the fan to "root for the Nets because the Knicks don't want you" and that Bierman was "a sad person" and probably an "alcoholic maybe".,[18][19][20] Dolan later addressed the issue with the press, but did not apologize, only saying the letter was a case of "tit for tat" and declaring the incident "over".,[21][22] Newly appointed NBA Commissioner Adam Silver did not reprimand or penalize Dolan, but instead further brushed the incident under the rug by calling Dolan a "consummate New Yorker” who received "an unkind email and responded with an unkind email”.,[23][24]
On February 9, 2017, former Knicks player Charles Oakley was removed from Madison Square Garden during a Knicks–Clippers game following an altercation with MSG security. Oakley contends that Dolan has ignored, if not ostracized, him.[25][26][27]
New York Rangers
After winning the Stanley Cup in 1994, the Rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of Dolan's increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the 1997-1998 season until the 2004–05 NHL lockout, despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years. This was the longest playoff drought in the franchise's history, in part due to questionable, expensive free-agent signings, such as Eric Lindros, Pavel Bure, and Theo Fleury. Despite fan and media calls for the team's general manager Glen Sather to be fired for the organization's shortcomings, Sather was retained. However, since the resolution of the NHL lockout in 2005, Dolan has allowed Sather to rebuild from the ground up, which has led to a revival of the club and the organization, culminating with a trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 2012, their first since 1997. However, when Dolan spoke of the team's Stanley Cup chances in January 2012, Rangers head coach John Tortorella took issue with his remarks. "I have my owner up here talking about a Stanley Cup. That's a bunch of bullshit," Tortorella said in response. "We need to take it one game at a time."[28]
New York Liberty
On May 5, 2015 Dolan announced that Isiah Thomas would serve as president of the WNBA’s Liberty. Considering Thomas' history being both a failed President/GM of the Knicks and Thomas being implicated in the Anucha Browne-Sanders sexual harassment incident, it was questioned by many fans and members of the press.[29][30][31][32]
Media policies
Dolan rarely speaks with members of the media and communicates to the press through released statements or in interviews with MSG Network. In 2000, Dolan instituted media training for all Garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media.[33] Under Dolan's watch MSG implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players. Some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and Knicks' beat writers from interviewing players without an MSG public relations official present, forbidding one-on-one interviews, and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the organization. The policies also forbid the MSG Network from being critical of the Knicks and the Rangers, regardless of their performance. Such measures were not standard practice for other NBA teams.[34] In addition, the Knicks did not make their medical staff available to the press.[35] In 2004, longtime broadcaster Marv Albert's contract was not renewed by MSG Network, allegedly because of his criticism of the Knicks' play.[36][37]

Personal life
Family
Dolan is married and resides on Long Island with his wife. He is the son of Cablevision founder Charles Dolan and nephew of Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan. Dolan's two brothers, Patrick and Thomas, serve on Cablevision's Board of Directors. Dolan is of Irish descent.[2]
Early life
After originally pursuing a career in music, Dolan eventually switched to a major in communications at SUNY New Paltz and began working for Cablevision in various capacities including sales before eventually being dispatched to Cleveland by his father to manage the launching of a sports radio station. In 1995, he was made CEO of Cablevision.
Drug and alcohol abuse
Throughout his early adult life, Dolan battled drug and alcohol problems and was reportedly known for having a volatile temper. In 1993, he went to drug rehabilitation at the Hazelden clinic in Center City, Minnesota.[3]
Hobbies
Dolan performs blues-inspired rock as the singer for JD & The Straight Shot and is also an avid sailor.
Business management
Dolan was an ardent opponent of his father's proposed Voom satellite service, which became a polarizing controversy among Cablevision's Board of Directors. While supporters argued Voom could propel Cablevision into the future emerging satellite market and a wider customer base, opponents of the plan, including James Dolan, argued it was too expensive with no expense relief for the foreseeable future. In the end, the younger Dolan prevailed and Voom was shut down. This was an instrumental event in Dolan emerging from his father's shadow, albeit reluctantly, as a viable businessman.[4]
However, his business career has not been without failures, which include purchasing the failing Wiz electronics and entertainment chain which ended up posting losses of $250 million before being liquidated and the Clearview Cinemas chain which has failed to generate any significant revenue.[5]
Philanthropy
Dolan is also dedicated to Cablevision's philanthropic partnership with The Lustgarten Foundation, the nation's largest private supporter of pancreatic cancer research. Together with Charles Dolan and former Cablevision Vice Chairman and Madison Square Garden Chairman Marc Lustgarten.[6] Dolan established the Foundation in 1998. In 2008, Cablevision made a multi-year commitment to underwrite the Foundation's costs, ensuring that 100 percent of every donation goes directly to researching this deadly disease.[7] With Dolan's backing, Cablevision also uses its assets to advance the curePC campaign, aimed at increasing public awareness of pancreatic cancer, and is responsible for organizing the Holiday Rock & Roll Bash, the Foundation's biggest annual fundraiser.[8][9]
Dolan also led MSG's response to local and national tragedies. He played a principal role in organizing the recent "12-12-12" benefit concert, which raised an initial $50 million for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, with additional money still coming in.[10] Other extraordinary benefit concerts have included "The Concert For New York City," which generated more than $35 million in aid for 9/11 victims and heroes, and "From The Big Apple to The Big Easy," which raised nearly $9 million for Hurricane Katrina relief.[11] Dolan also supports MSG's ongoing commitment to the community, particularly through the Garden of Dreams Foundation, the non-profit charity that partners with MSG to help children facing obstacles throughout the New York metropolitan area.[12]
Sports management
In 1994, Paramount Communications, the owner of Madison Square Garden, was acquired by Viacom, who in turn sold the MSG properties to Cablevision and ITT Corporation, which had 50% ownership each. ITT sold its share to Cablevision three years later.
In 1999, Dolan was given an increased role in managing Cablevision's sports properties and is now the primary manager of these assets. The teams under his domain include most notably the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks, the National Hockey League's New York Rangers, the Women's National Basketball Association's New York Liberty, and the American Hockey League's Hartford Wolf Pack.
As Chairman of Madison Square Garden, he supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams and regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. He also serves as a governor of the Knicks and Rangers to their respective leagues.
Controversies
New York Knicks
Like the Rangers, the Knicks performed abysmally in the early 2000s and have yet to recover, which fans mostly blame on Dolan's management missteps. Although the Knicks made the NBA Finals in 1999, they have not posted a winning season until the 2012-2013 season. Furthermore, the Knicks had not made the playoffs from the 2003-2004 season to the 2010-2011 season, which both ended in first round four game sweeps for the Knicks. Dolan has come under fire from many Knicks' fans for the team's run of consecutive losing seasons from 2001-2002 to 2009-2010. Numerous media[who?] and informal fan polls, including a recent Sports Illustrated poll, have ranked Dolan the worst owner in the NBA.[13] In 2007, NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Dolan's management of the Knicks, saying "they're not a model of intelligent management."[14][15] One widely criticized decision was to give shooting guard Allan Houston a 6-year, $100 million maximum contract in 2001, when no other team had offered Houston more than $75 million. Houston retired due to injury after just four seasons and with over $40 million remaining on his contract.
In 2003, Dolan hired Isiah Thomas as Team President of Basketball Operations and General Manager to replace embattled executive Scott Layden. Thomas made aggressive moves to re-tool and upgrade the Knicks roster through trades, the NBA Draft, and free agency. Despite the talent Thomas imported, the team did not perform up to expectations and Thomas was often the target of the frustration of Knick fans; Dolan was also on the receiving end of the ire of Knicks' fans for his commitment to Thomas in spite of Thomas' sometimes questionable decisions.
After the 2004-2005 season, the Knicks signed head coach Larry Brown to a 5-year, $50 million contract. After just one (losing) season, Brown was fired and the team bought-out Brown's contract for $18 million. Brown walked away with a total of $28 million for coaching the Knicks for just one year.
After firing Larry Brown, Isiah Thomas assumed the duties of being the head coach of the Knicks. During a staged interview on MSG Network, which is the last time Dolan answered questions from the media, Dolan gave Thomas an ultimatum to show "evident progress" or potentially be fired. In the latter half of the 2006-2007 season, with the Knicks within reach of a playoff spot, Dolan signed Thomas to a multi-year contract extension. The team subsequently fell out of contention and Dolan was castigated in many quarters for his extension of Thomas' contract. The next season, Dolan stripped Thomas of his front office duties because Thomas had taken the Knicks to the playoffs just once during his tenure. New team President Donnie Walsh removed Thomas as head coach upon the conclusion of the season.
Other coaches that also had short-lived tenures as head coaches of the Knicks include Don Chaney (2001–2003) and Lenny Wilkens (2003–2005). Like Thomas and Brown, they remained on the Knicks' payroll following their departure from the bench due to multi-year contracts signed with the owner (and in Chaney's case, 2 separate contract extensions).
In 2007, Dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former Knicks executive, Anucha Browne-Sanders. Browne-Sanders accused Dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from Isiah Thomas. The court ruled in favor of Brown-Sanders and Dolan had to pay $3 million of the $11 million settlement. MSG was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement.[16]
In July 2012, Dolan faced criticism for allowing popular Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin to sign with the Houston Rockets without matching their $25.1 million offer.[17]
In February 2015, Dolan responded to a letter from Irving Bierman, a 73-year-old, lifelong Knicks fan, that criticized Dolan's ownership of the Knicks and questioned his leadership with a seething letter of his own, telling the fan to "root for the Nets because the Knicks don't want you" and that Bierman was "a sad person" and probably an "alcoholic maybe".,[18][19][20] Dolan later addressed the issue with the press, but did not apologize, only saying the letter was a case of "tit for tat" and declaring the incident "over".,[21][22] Newly appointed NBA Commissioner Adam Silver did not reprimand or penalize Dolan, but instead further brushed the incident under the rug by calling Dolan a "consummate New Yorker” who received "an unkind email and responded with an unkind email”.,[23][24]
On February 9, 2017, former Knicks player Charles Oakley was removed from Madison Square Garden during a Knicks–Clippers game following an altercation with MSG security. Oakley contends that Dolan has ignored, if not ostracized, him.[25][26][27]
New York Rangers
After winning the Stanley Cup in 1994, the Rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of Dolan's increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the 1997-1998 season until the 2004–05 NHL lockout, despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years. This was the longest playoff drought in the franchise's history, in part due to questionable, expensive free-agent signings, such as Eric Lindros, Pavel Bure, and Theo Fleury. Despite fan and media calls for the team's general manager Glen Sather to be fired for the organization's shortcomings, Sather was retained. However, since the resolution of the NHL lockout in 2005, Dolan has allowed Sather to rebuild from the ground up, which has led to a revival of the club and the organization, culminating with a trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 2012, their first since 1997. However, when Dolan spoke of the team's Stanley Cup chances in January 2012, Rangers head coach John Tortorella took issue with his remarks. "I have my owner up here talking about a Stanley Cup. That's a bunch of bullshit," Tortorella said in response. "We need to take it one game at a time."[28]
New York Liberty
On May 5, 2015 Dolan announced that Isiah Thomas would serve as president of the WNBA’s Liberty. Considering Thomas' history being both a failed President/GM of the Knicks and Thomas being implicated in the Anucha Browne-Sanders sexual harassment incident, it was questioned by many fans and members of the press.[29][30][31][32]
Media policies
Dolan rarely speaks with members of the media and communicates to the press through released statements or in interviews with MSG Network. In 2000, Dolan instituted media training for all Garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media.[33] Under Dolan's watch MSG implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players. Some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and Knicks' beat writers from interviewing players without an MSG public relations official present, forbidding one-on-one interviews, and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the organization. The policies also forbid the MSG Network from being critical of the Knicks and the Rangers, regardless of their performance. Such measures were not standard practice for other NBA teams.[34] In addition, the Knicks did not make their medical staff available to the press.[35] In 2004, longtime broadcaster Marv Albert's contract was not renewed by MSG Network, allegedly because of his criticism of the Knicks' play.[36][37]

I would now like to introduce Jim Dolan, CEO of Cablevision.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Cindi, and good morning. Cablevision delivered strong financial results in 2014, while continuing to transform the Optimum experience. We developed higher quality customer relationships by offering products and services that provide superior value, provided expanded connectivity inside and outside the home, and enhancing the performance of our network. Our full year 2014 financial results reflect our progress.
Total company net revenue increased nearly 4% and AOCF increased by 9% compared with 2013. Our capital expenditures were $892 million, 6% lower than 2013. Full year 2014 free cash flow was $487 million and we declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend on February 24.
Our fourth quarter net customer results compared favorably with the third quarter. We added data customers despite significant competitive discounting and economic pressures in portions of our footprint. We also significantly reduced the loss of our customer relationships, even in our most competitive areas. Our results reflect a decrease in move and non-pay related churn versus the third quarter.

During the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue per customer. Disciplined approaches to pricing, promotional eligibility and customer credit policies are key elements of our strategy. While these policies reduce the number of our available sales opportunities, we believe they contribute to a stronger base of customers over time. We plan to continue these policies in 2015 while differentiating the value of Optimum in the marketplace.
During 2014, we introduced several new products and enhancements. Let me mention some of them of the more notable initiatives. We introduced two new Optimum Online speed tiers. We enhanced our TV to GO video experience by integrating more than 50 networks into the Optimum app. We improved our multi-room DVR by increasing simultaneous recordings to 15 shows. We also signed our first advertising clients to our new data and analytics service.
In addition to these product enhancements, we continued to improve our customer service activity. 2014 total customer service phone calls declined by nearly 16%. Trouble call truck rolls declined 21%, each as compared with 2013. These achievements reflect the contributions of our nearly 15,000 employees. In 2014, we continued to invest in our people and transform our culture to one that is more performance-based. We did this through new recognition, training and development programs as well as a new non-executive performance bonus plans.
And finally, let's discuss our Wi-Fi initiatives. In 2014, we launched our newest Wi-Fi Smart Router. We also surpassed our goal of reaching more than 1 million Optimum Wi-Fi access points within our service area. We continued to see remarkable growth in our Optimum Wi-Fi usage. During the fourth quarter, our customers used more than four times the amount of data than during the fourth quarter of 2013.
Wi-Fi is a critical part of our product strategy and one of our most important strategic assets. As I have noted before, we plan to continue to innovate in this area, which brings me to Freewheel, our most recent effort to monetize our investment in Wi-Fi. Freewheel is the first all-Wi-Fi device from a cable provider. It is available nationwide and delivers unlimited data, talk, and text. It works anywhere in the world where you are connected to Wi-Fi. Freewheel is backed by our carrier-grade Optimum Wi-Fi network with 1.1 million hotspots in the tri-state area.
Today, Optimum Wi-Fi customers pass an average of more than 6 gigabytes of data per month. That is nearly three times more data than the most commonly purchased data plans from cellular providers. Against this backdrop, we believe Freewheel will be the beginning of a disruptive force to the cellular industry.
As a company, we are solidifying our position as our customers' preferred connectivity company. Freewheel is a natural progression of this strategy. It is the first in a series of new products and services which we intend to launch in order to better serve our customers' needs.
For three years, we have been improving our relationships with our customers. Today, service quality has become a key differentiator of the Optimum experience, and we remain committed to being the best service provider in the industry. In 2015, as we continue this important work, we expect to introduce additional innovative products and repackage certain of our current offerings. Our goal is to meet and exceed the rapidly evolving demands of our customers.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Gregg Seibert.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Well, thank you, Jim, and good morning. Total company fourth quarter net revenue increased 3% and AOCF declined by 3.4% as compared with the prior-year period. Capital expenditures were $262 million compared with $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $88 million.

During the quarter, we gained nearly 4,000 net high-speed data customers. Customer relationships and voice customers both decreased by 11,000, and video customers declined by 34,000.
Fourth quarter average monthly revenue per customer increased by nearly $8 to $155.20 as compared with the prior-year period. This increase is consistent with our pricing strategies and principally reflects recent rate initiatives, our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and higher advertising revenue. Fourth quarter total Cable revenue increased by 3.1%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customer relationships.
As compared with 2013, fourth quarter Cable advertising revenue increased by 9%, driven primarily by increased political and issue-related spending. This growth was offset in part by lower banking and leisure spending. Our audience data and addressable advertising campaigns contributed to this growth and we are successfully attracting new national advertisers with our advanced advertising and measurement capabilities.
Cable AOCF declined 4.6% in the fourth quarter as compared with the prior-year period. This primarily reflects the impact of fewer customers and higher programming, employee-related and marketing costs, as well as higher legal expenses and other fees. This was partially offset by revenue growth and lower costs associated with the decline in trouble call related truck rolls and customer service calls.
Cable's fourth quarter AOCF margin was 30.3%. Full year 2014 AOCF margin was 31.7%, slightly higher than the prior year period comparable margin of 31.2%. Cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was $222 million, a $46 million increase from the same period in 2013. This increase reflects the timing of CPE purchases and higher spending on Wi-Fi and support capital.
Total Cable capital spending for 2014 was approximately 8% lower than the comparable 2013 level. AOCF and capital expenditures for the fourth quarter reflect modest pre-launch investments in Freewheel.
Lightpath's fourth quarter revenue increased 6.2% and AOCF increased 10% over the prior-year period. These increases reflect revenue growth in Ethernet-based services, partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services. During 2014, Lightpath's network expanded to approximately 7,400 buildings, an increase of 600 connections. Lightpath also added 100-gigabit Optical Transport services and managed video conferencing to its suite of products. Lightpath's expanding product portfolio and nearly ubiquitous footprint, continue to present us with a great opportunity to grow into the mid and large enterprise space.
In our Other segment, fourth quarter revenue was essentially flat and the AOCF deficit improved by 4.5%. These results principally reflect higher advertising revenue at News 12, partially offset by lower advertising revenue at Newsday. AOCF also reflects reduced expenditures at certain other businesses. We continue to focus on transforming the Optimum experience and strengthening our position as the market's premier connectivity company by investing in our network, products, and employees while continuing to respond to the evolving marketplace with innovative products, such as Freewheel.
Looking forward to 2015, we currently anticipate that total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for Freewheel, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results. However, this is a dynamic business and we anticipate updating our guidance as the year progresses.
Now, turning to the company's financial position, the company's fourth quarter consolidated cash position was $850 million and net debt was $7.9 billion. We had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings as of the end of 2014. During 2014, we executed a number of successful financing transactions, which extended our maturities, strengthened our balance sheet, and improved our strong liquidity position while funding our quarterly dividend. We plan to apply our 2015 free cash flow in a similar manner.

In May, we issued $750 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2024 at par, which was the lowest bond issuance coupon in the company's history. The net proceeds and a portion of our cash on hand were used to repay $750 million of our term loan B credit facility.
Later in the year, CSC Holdings made a $200 million voluntary repayment of its term loan B facility. This transaction results in cash interest savings over the remaining term of the facility as well as improving our debt maturity profile by reducing our 2020 debt maturities. We also used cash on hand to opportunistically repurchase approximately $37 million of Cablevision senior notes. This was executed at an average price below par and will generate cash interest savings over the term of the notes.
At December 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.5 times. The CSC Holdings' Restricted Group bank leverage ratio was 3.1 times. In calculating our total company leverage ratio, AOCF is determined using latest quarter annualized AOCF. As a result, our leverage ratios are more sensitive to changes in quarterly AOCF than they would be if our leverage was measured based on trailing 12-month AOCF.
We did not repurchase shares of Cablevision stock during 2014. We have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization. Finally, in June, Charter Communications reached a settlement with the Montana Department of Revenue related to a property tax dispute that was originally litigated during our ownership of Bresnan Communications. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we received substantially all of the approximately $6.6 million in cash that we expect to receive from Charter as a result of this settlement.
Operator, we're now prepared to open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And your first question comes from Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo.
Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks. Two questions. First, Gregg, can you just clarify, when you talk about AOCF and CapEx being similar in 2015 and 2014, are you talking about an absolute basis or growth?
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Well, I'm talking about absolute numbers, Marci. And I think, as we look to the 2015 guidance, as everybody on this call is aware, we manage this business on a long-term basis. We're not managing it for quarterly earnings. And one of the things that's very important to us is to be able to manage the business in a dynamic fashion. Jim alluded to the fact that we're considering additional new products this year. And while we have nothing to announce today, what we're trying to do is provide guidance that (15:23) very thoughtful guidance.
Last year, we got a tiny bit of criticism for the fact that we were conservative in our guidance. I'm not saying that we're conservative in the guidance for 2015 but, again, rather thoughtful. As we look at AOCF percentage changes, 1 percentage point change in AOCF is roughly $18 million. That's a relatively small amount when you're talking about numbers for the magnitude that this business generates. So, from our perspective, we're optimistic about 2015, but we are going to update the guidance as we go through the year. And we're comfortable looking at AOCF and capital being substantially similar to where they came in in 2014.
Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you for that. And then my follow-up is for Jim. You mentioned in your opening comments the competitive environment, which I think you probably mention every quarter. Is there anything that you're seeing that's different now either in the fourth quarter going into the first quarter? Thanks.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
From the point of view, you mean, of competition? I mean, our competitor hasn't changed. They're not competing any more than they were competing before or any less than they were competing before. So, no, I guess, there's not much of a change.

Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies.
Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks. Gregg, just if you could think more about on the CapEx side, you've had pretty elevated CPE with some of the project work you've been undertaking. And not to sort of shed light on what 2015 projects look like, but I guess we're sort of looking and saying, why shouldn't that be a lower number in 2015. And then, if you could, maybe just a comment on cash taxes for 2015.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Let's start with the cash tax comment. Thankfully, we have bonus depreciation again. So I do not anticipate that we'll run through the NOL in 2015, so cash taxes will be quite light yet again.
In terms of the capital side of the equation, Mike, you call out the CPE number. We had an increase in CPE in the fourth quarter. But a lot of what happens with CPE, as you know, is timing of expenditures. We ended up with additional purchases of boxes, of managed routers, some remotes in the fourth quarter. But it's not necessarily CPE that will keep capital expenditures sort of roughly these levels. We continue to invest in WiFi, we continue across-the-board to invest in our network, and we're going to continue those efforts. As you'll recall from a few years ago, there was a period where we didn't feel the plant was up to the capability it needed to be up to. But that's not going to – as we said many times, that's not going to happen again. We're going to keep the level of investment up to a point where we can truly realize this ambition of being the premier connectivity company in the New York marketplace.
Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC
Great. Gregg, I'm sorry. Just on the other thing on the SG&A, looks like a pretty good sequential increase. Is there seasonality there? And maybe just if you could size up the employee-related impact, that'd be great.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Well, what I'd actually do is – want to talk just a tiny bit about the gross margin items in the quarter, because we had a couple of items that jump off the sheet, which you'll see in the K, because, for example, our Cable recurring revenue was up $40 million in the quarter, our programming costs were up $25 million. So you would normally expect more of a margin improvement under that type of scenario. But we had $10 million of severance in the quarter.
Severance in the fourth quarter of 2013 was below the AOCF line item because of the fact that we had a formal restructuring. This year, it's not, so that's a $10 million delta. And advertising expense was up by $13 million year-over-year. Some of that was related to the Freewheel launch. And those two items and some additional fees associated with the launch of Freewheel had an impact on the quarter. So those were sort of the bigger items. There was some increase in compensation cost, but that's something that happens fairly frequently in the fourth quarter as we true up the ultimate incentive programs to the actual results for the year.
Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC
Great. Good luck on the new role.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I have three if that's okay. The first is for Jim, Gregg, and Kristin. Jim, you said at the beginning of the call that WiFi is one of your most important strategic assets. Obviously, you're starting with Freewheel. Can you give us your longer term, like, how you're thinking about things over the longer term?

James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
You mean about WiFi or just overall about the company?
Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Well, if you want to do both, that's fine. I meant specifically WiFi because you said it was one of the most important strategic assets.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Sure. WiFi is connectivity, and connectivity on a wireless basis. And what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we believe is the, for lack of a better term, the wave of the future is more and more and more reliance on WiFi by our customers, because their use of data is going up. But also, for instance, if you went to the Consumer Electronics Show this year, I don't think there was hardly anything on the floor that wasn't connected using a WiFi device. I didn't see one thing, by the way, being connected using a cellular device.
All of this tells us that connectivity, particularly on a wireless basis, is going to become more and more important to our consumers. We want to be the company that provides that connectivity. We want to be the company that's seen as being the best at providing that connectivity. Now, we think that that's sort of the first part of the wave. The second part is that there are products and services that will go along with that strategic position. The first of which you've just seen, which is Freewheel. But there will be others and we feel that we will be poised and ready to take advantage of the strategic position that we've created by investing in WiFi in order to do that.
So, other than that, from the company point of view, I would say that the other thing that we see which is really very closely related is that connectivity has surpassed video as the primary product for a company like ours. And we need to continue to strategize our product offerings to reflect that with different packaging, et cetera, which is something I think we will do in 2015.
Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. And then one for Gregg. Gregg, just a little more specific, but you mentioned that there was an increase in the build-out. I think you said 600 buildings. Is there a way that you can size how big the opportunity – as you continue to increase buildings, is there like a potential market size that you can address?
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
On the Lightpath side, Jessica, the building count matters a lot, but it matters in two directions. One of the – when I first started working closely with Dave Pistacchio, who runs Lightpath, a couple of years ago, one of the key attributes of the business at that point in time was that we were spending roughly $0.35 in capital for every dollar of revenue that we were generating. And I think that we had a very high AOCF margin in that business which was great, but when you're putting so much back into capital, the free cash flow profile of the business is not as attractive as the free cash flow profile is in Cable.
And one of the things that we were doing was we were lighting a lot of additional buildings, and not getting the same type of sell-through or at least sort of targeted-type of sell-through for additional tenants in already wired buildings. So I think what Dave and his team are doing now is they are selectively lighting new buildings when they have a new anchor tenant. But one of the reasons the margins have been expanding, particularly the cash flow margin, in that business has been the fact that we're doing a better job of making sure that we're marketing through secondary tenants in those buildings. We don't have to light a new building in the Lightpath business in order to generate incremental revenue. The cash flow characteristics of that account become substantially better.

I'd argue lots of growth opportunity for Lightpath. We mentioned some of the new managed services they're providing, and lots of room in the footprint. It's still a very fragmented business of which we have a minority share. And my expectation is that we're going to keep building that share.
Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. And then the last one for Kristin. So you guys – obviously, it's an advertising question. I just was wondering if you could give us some color on the progress you've had in selling data. And how willing are advertisers to use that data versus, say, Nielsen?
And I guess the second part of the question would be, you've been building, and building, and building targeted advertising. Where do you think you are in the process? Is it where you want to be, or is there still like a runway?
Kristin Aigner Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yes. We continue to be very enthusiastic. I think last quarter despite a decline in local TV ad markets of 10%, our ad revenue grew by 9%. So that is definitely something we're enthusiastic about. We view and a significant amount of development work and now that Dibble is here, and we think more about integrating more data like with we did with Time Warner Cable and utilizing the analytics that we derived from that data to create new products and services. We think there's a lot more room to grow. I don't know if that answers your question.
Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And then when you're selling the data, like, how willing are people to – how willing are your customers to use that versus, let's say, Nielsen?
Kristin Aigner Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
I don't think I can speak directly to Nielsen. What I will say is the value of census level, which is household data down to individual homes versus an extrapolation that we always talk about, the fact that Nielsen has 365 people meters in the entire New York Metro footprint, which doesn't even equates the amount of channels that we offer, shows the big difference of us being able to monitor every single channel tuned in real time for every single set-top across our entire footprint. So if you look at 365 boxes to indicate activity versus 7 million set-tops, I think you can kind of get a sense of why the advertisers are interested and why it matters.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Isn't it more important from the advertiser perspective than actually selling the data, in terms of how you're optimizing packages for a lot of our customers and using up a lot of dayparts...
Kristin Aigner Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yes.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
...that otherwise wouldn't be used up.
Kristin Aigner Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yeah. The long-tailed content, non-traditional daypart, the value of cable overall, there's a lot of different tails to this, and all of them are positive. And we're enthusiastic about all of them.
Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Amy Yong of Macquarie.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Thanks. Two questions. You spent a lot of time talking about WiFi. Do you expect that you could actually increase your market share outside of the current footprint? My second question is more for Gregg. As you look into 2015, you gave a lot of AOCF and free cash flow guidance. At what point could you actually tap down on the buyback? Thanks.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Well, I'll take the buyback question first which is, at this point in time, we continue to have our $0.15 per share quarterly dividend. That's a very attractive return of capital for our shareholders. And at this point, we're looking at that really as the primary return of capital.

The additional free cash flow that we generated above and beyond dividend requirement last year was for the most part used for debt reduction. And I think that we're going to continue to be prudent in the way that we run our leverage and maturity profiles. So, I think that to the extent we're generating free cash flow in excess of the dividend, it is much more likely that you will see us use that free cash flow to pay down additional debt rather than to repurchase shares at this point. But, again, if there was a market event, if there was – we'll continue to be opportunistic, and that's one of the reasons we keep the share repurchase program in place.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
As far as going outside of our footprint, I assume you're talking about Freewheel, because as far as the network and the cable systems go, we certainly have no plans to go out and overbuild anybody because we don't think they work. But, Freewheel is available across the United States, and, actually, across the world. And we are seeing uses for the product outside of our footprint. In fact, Kristin, you want to talk about Europe or...
Kristin Aigner Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yeah. So we're seeing some interest – really enthusiastic interest from expats and from people who travel frequently outside the country, because they're able to maintain a U.S. phone number, they don't incur any roaming charges when they're on WiFi, either in their hotel or particularly in the UK where there's a lot of WiFi available and throughout Europe. So the idea of having a flat rate U.S. sort of sat phone that they can use to conduct all their U.S. business is one of the sort of interesting opportunities for us that we've uncovered as we started rolling out Freewheel. So we think there's more opportunity there, particularly in Europe and also in the Caribbean.
Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. I think you guys had about $935 million of federal gross NOLs at the end of 2013. I was just wondering if you could update us on where those are at year-end 2014. And then when do you expect to become a full cash taxpayer? What year? And is it important for you to either minimize or not pay sizeable federal income taxes in the long term? Thank you.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Okay, Jason. So, right now, the balance of the NOL is at $620 million. I would have predicted at this time a year ago if I were making forecasts, which I don't, that the NOL would be running out during 2015. However, once again, we've got bonus depreciation this year, which has extended our runway by an additional year. And the question really becomes what does tax policy look like going forward. Will we get bonus depreciation again? If we do, my guess is that that would push the target out another year.
So, right now, my belief is that 2015 we'll not have material cash taxes. 2016 is a little bit up in the air toward the end of the year. But again, we'll see what tax policy looks like. As far as taxes are concerned, it's very straightforward. A dollar that you pay in tax comes out of free cash flow. And so what we do within the limits of the tax code is we aggressively manage our exposure and so far we've been quite successful in maintaining the free cash flow profile.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.
Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC
Hi. Good morning. Two if I could. First, I guess, Jimmy or Kristin, can you just talk about how you think about strategically the push and pull of trying to balance margins on the one hand and trying to sustain subscriber growth on the other – or at least subscriber stability on the other, and how you make those decisions? And then second – first, congratulations to both Gregg and Brian. Gregg, could you just talk a little bit about your new role and what it is you hope to accomplish in the new role that's spanning the different organizations?

Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Jim or Kristin, would you like to go first?
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, this is Jimmy.
Kristin Aigner Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Not Kristy.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Right. And I'm not quite sure I completely understand your question, Craig. I mean, do you want to know how we balance margin against subscriber...
Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC
Against subscriber growth. How do you think about raising prices in a way that sustains your margins, but may also hurt your subscriber metrics? And how do you prioritize between those two things?
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I mean, we try and keep the margins. Right? We're trying to keep our expenses as low as possible and we think there's more opportunity in that. But we are not willing to sacrifice any of our levels of service. And, in fact, we think we can improve them. And I think if you take a look at our performance over the last 18 months, we've done exactly that.
As we transition from being what is a traditional cable company to a connectivity company, we anticipate that our ability to reduce expenses will continue to increase, except in the area of programming. In the area of programming, there's very little that a cable company can do to reduce its exposure in terms of increasing programming cost and there's no real way to continue – to pass that on to the customer in a competitive environment.
So I expect, on the video side, we will expect to see reducing margins, primarily due to programming expense. On the other side, I expect that we will see increasing margins from the data side. The good news is with that is that the consumer values the connectivity product more than they do the video product at this point. And so that's roughly how we look at it. I'm not sure that even answers your question, but.
Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC
No, that's helpful. Thank you.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Good. And Craig, from my perspective, I'm obviously not going to speak for Josh or for Ted. You'll hear about their views as to the strategic landscape, Josh's tomorrow and I think Ted just went through his on the MSG call. But from my perspective, it's an opportunity to continue to look at the ecosystem and the way that each of these three companies fits within a rapidly changing ecosystem. It's obviously not just the changes, not just affecting Cablevision.
And I felt very comfortable taking this new role because of the fact that we have a very experienced financial team here at Cablevision. You've met a number of the individuals, as have many of the investors on this call. It's a great team. I think Brian's leadership is going to be instrumental in making sure that this is a smooth transition. But I also have to tell you, I'm still going to be here. Jim and the board have asked me to continue to play a key role at Cablevision working with the leadership team across-the-board on the company's financial and corporate strategy, and additionally on Investor Relations. So, for some period of time, you're going to be hearing my voice on these calls and at investor meetings, and I look forward to continuing in that role.
Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC
That's helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. One on Freewheel and one on video. Jim, you alluded to some new packaging, I think on the video side, in your prepared remarks. But as you know, the programmers sort of make you carry everything. So just wondering if you have some color you can add to that, how you might think about repackaging video and what the strategy is there in terms of addressing maybe a different kind of customer set than you've had in the past.

And then on the Freewheel side, all the carriers who just spent, whatever it was, $40 billion on spectrum would claim WiFi has QoS issues and hand-off issues. Now that you have a product in the market, can you talk about how the consumer experience is? Are you finding people are happy with the service, and do you have a plan for hand-off where WiFi can become a true replacement for cellular in terms of moving around? Thanks.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'll handle it. I think...
Kristin Aigner Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Okay.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
...if I need help. So, in terms of WiFi, I think it's a little early on the customer experience. We do have some early indications that customers are finding the product to do what we said it was going to do, and that they're enjoying it. I hear a lot of anecdotal information from individual customers, et cetera, users of the product that we find very positive and reinforcing. But I don't think we're ready yet to start defining the user experience, and we don't have enough metrics in the house yet to do that. So – and see I'm trying – your other question?
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just on video packaging, how you think about changing that.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So, I mean, the thing about it is that the big shift here is what I said before. The consumer would, if given a choice, they – you said, you can either have your video product or you can have your data product. Right? Now, almost overwhelmingly, will take the data product. And that's a pretty big shift, particularly as we go out to the marketplace.
Now, as far as what the cellular companies are suggesting, right, in terms of hand-offs, et cetera, we already do do hand-offs, but not over 30 miles an hour, which basically means that if you're in a car going down the LIE, it won't help you there. But we're very upfront with that with the product and now I think pretty much everybody knows that about WiFi.
And our anticipation is that the technology will continue to develop and I think that at some point, even that will be included in the product set. But I think the bigger indication and the one that cellular companies have to truly worry about is the one I talked about before, nobody's building connectivity using cellular, nobody. Everybody is using WiFi, and so why is that?
I think the answer to that is obvious, right? WiFi is a much more efficient effective method of delivering data between a device, a network and a server. And so, we can listen to the people who already invested their $40 billion defend why they invested their $40 billion. But technology is technology, science is science and this is what it is, and I think that, in my opinion, the die is cast here.
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So...
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Is there an opportunity on the video side to do smaller packages based on your contracts? It seems like sort of skinny video or maybe some kind of HBO over-the-top. Are you looking at any of those opportunities?
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Look, I don't want to let any cats out of the bag, but I will tell you that we're going to be very reactive to what we see, what the consumer wants. The consumer wants their connectivity first. They're a little less concerned, right, with what their video packages are and some of them would prefer to save money on those. We're going to be reactive to that and we're going to continue to package our products so that we meet their needs and their demands. More to come maybe the next call.

Kristin Aigner Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
May I just add one thing, too? If you're talking about QoS, think about QoS on streaming video and compare your cellular experience to your WiFi experience, because that's what we're chasing. We're not chasing QoS on a phone call.
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. That's very helpful. Thank you, both.

Thank you. Your next question comes from James Ratcliffe of Buckingham Research.
James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. One is in housekeeping. Why did homes passed tick down in 4Q? Is it something seasonal or anything else going on? And secondly, with all the debate around net neutrality, I mean, assuming the rules that are going into effect are in line with the Chairman's comments and proposals from earlier this month, is there anything you do differently in your business versus a world where we are continuing to have no net neutrality rules on the books? Thanks.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. James, I'll address serviceable passings. From time to time, we do a review of our 5 million-plus serviceable passings to eliminate discrepancies and accurately depict our footprint. The net decrease during the fourth quarter was just the result of that year-end review, nothing more.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
And as far as net neutrality goes, we're never – I mean, we're like any other business. The idea of more regulation is never great for us. But to be honest, we don't really see at least what the Chairman's been discussing as having any real effect on our business. So, therefore, we're sort of neutral.
James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks. So I'm talking to you over a WiFi phone. Please forgive me if it doesn't work. But...
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Sounds pretty good from here.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
It does, right? Given your comments, it sounds like you don't believe you'll ever need cellular. Is that fair as a backup on that service?
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I don't know. It's certainly not in our plans at the moment, right. Freewheel is a WiFi product. So, I don't – we're not going out after the voice market per se from that perspective. So, I mean, Kristin, do you want to...
Kristin Aigner Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yeah. I mean, as we keep saying, it's a product that has the data and also makes phone calls and texting. But we did nearly 1 billion sessions over WiFi in the fourth quarter, and our average customer is utilizing more than 6 gigabits of data a month. From where we sit, data is what matters, WiFi was built for data, and we don't see any indications that people's thirst – aggressive thirst for data is going into decline. So, we're planning for the future. We're not chasing, as I said before, we're not chasing the cellular markets to be a mobile phone provider. That's just not what the strategy for this product is about.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Go ahead.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And then given that – I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
No. No. No. Please.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
So, given the CapEx budget is essentially flat, should we look for that WiFi rollout within the base to continue at essentially the 2014 pace?
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer

I don't know that it's flat. I chose my words very specifically, Phil, and I said substantially similar. I wouldn't necessarily read flat into that. I think our capital budget in 2015 is just going to be dependent on what changes we opt to make in the business. I think you'll continue to see WiFi build-out throughout. It continues to be a core product for us. But it's going to be a dynamic budget, and I'm not really comfortable breaking it into components at this point in the year.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. But given that WiFi is now called a third of the base over just a little bit over a year, that should still have a long way to go. Is that correct?
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think you can certainly anticipate that there's going to be more proliferation of both private and public WiFi hotspots. I mean, it's part of the core strategy of the company. You're going to see us continue to invest in the areas that will make connectivity even better for our customers. Clearly, that's one of them. So...
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Thanks, guys.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Operator, we're going to take one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Your final question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Thank you. Just quickly, so now that you're saying access is the most important product, I assume that you're more inclined to support over-the-top and just be more agnostic on that. Is that what we could expect to see a little bit more aggressively? And then looking at the offer in Lightpath, what tactics are you using to get the additional tenants in the building? That's been a little bit elusive for other fiber providers that have wired-up buildings. How are you having success there where some of your competitors have not?
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
I think what Dave and his team are doing on the Lightpath side is they've made substantial changes in the sales organization. There also have been substantial changes made in the incentive compensation or commission structure for the sales organization. Two years ago, I would say that the bulk of our sales effort within Lightpath was concentrated on Long Island. We're a Long Island-based company. And yet quite a bit of the growth was occurring in New Jersey and Connecticut. Been some pretty significant shifts there, and as we have shifted resources from one part of the footprint to another part of the footprint, we've also changed the structure, changed the incentive, changed the sales management, and I think it's all just basic blocking and tackling within the building. So I'd love to tell you there's a specific silver bullet that could be applied across the industry, but I really think it's just that basic blocking and tackling that makes a difference.
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
What was the other part of your question?
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Well, just being more agnostic as far as whether you're selling linear video versus over-the-top products, whether it's your own product or others that are out there. How should we think about your mix a couple years out?
James Lawrence Dolan - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, the way the current trajectories are headed, I would suggest that we'll probably be agnostic about the video and not about the connectivity.
Kristin Aigner Dolan - Chief Operating Officer & Director
I think to your question about access, we already have 100 networks accessible through our Optimum app. Our Optimum app gets a ton of usage, and the combination of the Optimum app with any network that's allowing out-of-home streaming is a total win. And then when you combine that with the WiFi backbone, it's really – that's the vision for us with our customers to access any product anywhere, anytime within the footprint.

Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Thank you. That's very helpful.
Gregg G. Seibert - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, all.

Personal life
Family
Dolan is married and resides on Long Island with his wife. He is the son of Cablevision founder Charles Dolan and nephew of Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan. Dolan's two brothers, Patrick and Thomas, serve on Cablevision's Board of Directors. Dolan is of Irish descent.[2]
Early life
After originally pursuing a career in music, Dolan eventually switched to a major in communications at SUNY New Paltz and began working for Cablevision in various capacities including sales before eventually being dispatched to Cleveland by his father to manage the launching of a sports radio station. In 1995, he was made CEO of Cablevision.
Drug and alcohol abuse
Throughout his early adult life, Dolan battled drug and alcohol problems and was reportedly known for having a volatile temper. In 1993, he went to drug rehabilitation at the Hazelden clinic in Center City, Minnesota.[3]
Hobbies
Dolan performs blues-inspired rock as the singer for JD & The Straight Shot and is also an avid sailor.
Business management
Dolan was an ardent opponent of his father's proposed Voom satellite service, which became a polarizing controversy among Cablevision's Board of Directors. While supporters argued Voom could propel Cablevision into the future emerging satellite market and a wider customer base, opponents of the plan, including James Dolan, argued it was too expensive with no expense relief for the foreseeable future. In the end, the younger Dolan prevailed and Voom was shut down. This was an instrumental event in Dolan emerging from his father's shadow, albeit reluctantly, as a viable businessman.[4]
However, his business career has not been without failures, which include purchasing the failing Wiz electronics and entertainment chain which ended up posting losses of $250 million before being liquidated and the Clearview Cinemas chain which has failed to generate any significant revenue.[5]
Philanthropy
Dolan is also dedicated to Cablevision's philanthropic partnership with The Lustgarten Foundation, the nation's largest private supporter of pancreatic cancer research. Together with Charles Dolan and former Cablevision Vice Chairman and Madison Square Garden Chairman Marc Lustgarten.[6] Dolan established the Foundation in 1998. In 2008, Cablevision made a multi-year commitment to underwrite the Foundation's costs, ensuring that 100 percent of every donation goes directly to researching this deadly disease.[7] With Dolan's backing, Cablevision also uses its assets to advance the curePC campaign, aimed at increasing public awareness of pancreatic cancer, and is responsible for organizing the Holiday Rock & Roll Bash, the Foundation's biggest annual fundraiser.[8][9]
Dolan also led MSG's response to local and national tragedies. He played a principal role in organizing the recent "12-12-12" benefit concert, which raised an initial $50 million for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, with additional money still coming in.[10] Other extraordinary benefit concerts have included "The Concert For New York City," which generated more than $35 million in aid for 9/11 victims and heroes, and "From The Big Apple to The Big Easy," which raised nearly $9 million for Hurricane Katrina relief.[11] Dolan also supports MSG's ongoing commitment to the community, particularly through the Garden of Dreams Foundation, the non-profit charity that partners with MSG to help children facing obstacles throughout the New York metropolitan area.[12]
Sports management
In 1994, Paramount Communications, the owner of Madison Square Garden, was acquired by Viacom, who in turn sold the MSG properties to Cablevision and ITT Corporation, which had 50% ownership each. ITT sold its share to Cablevision three years later.
In 1999, Dolan was given an increased role in managing Cablevision's sports properties and is now the primary manager of these assets. The teams under his domain include most notably the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks, the National Hockey League's New York Rangers, the Women's National Basketball Association's New York Liberty, and the American Hockey League's Hartford Wolf Pack.
As Chairman of Madison Square Garden, he supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams and regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. He also serves as a governor of the Knicks and Rangers to their respective leagues.
Controversies
New York Knicks
Like the Rangers, the Knicks performed abysmally in the early 2000s and have yet to recover, which fans mostly blame on Dolan's management missteps. Although the Knicks made the NBA Finals in 1999, they have not posted a winning season until the 2012-2013 season. Furthermore, the Knicks had not made the playoffs from the 2003-2004 season to the 2010-2011 season, which both ended in first round four game sweeps for the Knicks. Dolan has come under fire from many Knicks' fans for the team's run of consecutive losing seasons from 2001-2002 to 2009-2010. Numerous media[who?] and informal fan polls, including a recent Sports Illustrated poll, have ranked Dolan the worst owner in the NBA.[13] In 2007, NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Dolan's management of the Knicks, saying "they're not a model of intelligent management."[14][15] One widely criticized decision was to give shooting guard Allan Houston a 6-year, $100 million maximum contract in 2001, when no other team had offered Houston more than $75 million. Houston retired due to injury after just four seasons and with over $40 million remaining on his contract.
In 2003, Dolan hired Isiah Thomas as Team President of Basketball Operations and General Manager to replace embattled executive Scott Layden. Thomas made aggressive moves to re-tool and upgrade the Knicks roster through trades, the NBA Draft, and free agency. Despite the talent Thomas imported, the team did not perform up to expectations and Thomas was often the target of the frustration of Knick fans; Dolan was also on the receiving end of the ire of Knicks' fans for his commitment to Thomas in spite of Thomas' sometimes questionable decisions.
After the 2004-2005 season, the Knicks signed head coach Larry Brown to a 5-year, $50 million contract. After just one (losing) season, Brown was fired and the team bought-out Brown's contract for $18 million. Brown walked away with a total of $28 million for coaching the Knicks for just one year.
After firing Larry Brown, Isiah Thomas assumed the duties of being the head coach of the Knicks. During a staged interview on MSG Network, which is the last time Dolan answered questions from the media, Dolan gave Thomas an ultimatum to show "evident progress" or potentially be fired. In the latter half of the 2006-2007 season, with the Knicks within reach of a playoff spot, Dolan signed Thomas to a multi-year contract extension. The team subsequently fell out of contention and Dolan was castigated in many quarters for his extension of Thomas' contract. The next season, Dolan stripped Thomas of his front office duties because Thomas had taken the Knicks to the playoffs just once during his tenure. New team President Donnie Walsh removed Thomas as head coach upon the conclusion of the season.
Other coaches that also had short-lived tenures as head coaches of the Knicks include Don Chaney (2001–2003) and Lenny Wilkens (2003–2005). Like Thomas and Brown, they remained on the Knicks' payroll following their departure from the bench due to multi-year contracts signed with the owner (and in Chaney's case, 2 separate contract extensions).
In 2007, Dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former Knicks executive, Anucha Browne-Sanders. Browne-Sanders accused Dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from Isiah Thomas. The court ruled in favor of Brown-Sanders and Dolan had to pay $3 million of the $11 million settlement. MSG was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement.[16]
In July 2012, Dolan faced criticism for allowing popular Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin to sign with the Houston Rockets without matching their $25.1 million offer.[17]
In February 2015, Dolan responded to a letter from Irving Bierman, a 73-year-old, lifelong Knicks fan, that criticized Dolan's ownership of the Knicks and questioned his leadership with a seething letter of his own, telling the fan to "root for the Nets because the Knicks don't want you" and that Bierman was "a sad person" and probably an "alcoholic maybe".,[18][19][20] Dolan later addressed the issue with the press, but did not apologize, only saying the letter was a case of "tit for tat" and declaring the incident "over".,[21][22] Newly appointed NBA Commissioner Adam Silver did not reprimand or penalize Dolan, but instead further brushed the incident under the rug by calling Dolan a "consummate New Yorker” who received "an unkind email and responded with an unkind email”.,[23][24]
On February 9, 2017, former Knicks player Charles Oakley was removed from Madison Square Garden during a Knicks–Clippers game following an altercation with MSG security. Oakley contends that Dolan has ignored, if not ostracized, him.[25][26][27]
New York Rangers
After winning the Stanley Cup in 1994, the Rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of Dolan's increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the 1997-1998 season until the 2004–05 NHL lockout, despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years. This was the longest playoff drought in the franchise's history, in part due to questionable, expensive free-agent signings, such as Eric Lindros, Pavel Bure, and Theo Fleury. Despite fan and media calls for the team's general manager Glen Sather to be fired for the organization's shortcomings, Sather was retained. However, since the resolution of the NHL lockout in 2005, Dolan has allowed Sather to rebuild from the ground up, which has led to a revival of the club and the organization, culminating with a trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 2012, their first since 1997. However, when Dolan spoke of the team's Stanley Cup chances in January 2012, Rangers head coach John Tortorella took issue with his remarks. "I have my owner up here talking about a Stanley Cup. That's a bunch of bullshit," Tortorella said in response. "We need to take it one game at a time."[28]
New York Liberty
On May 5, 2015 Dolan announced that Isiah Thomas would serve as president of the WNBA’s Liberty. Considering Thomas' history being both a failed President/GM of the Knicks and Thomas being implicated in the Anucha Browne-Sanders sexual harassment incident, it was questioned by many fans and members of the press.[29][30][31][32]
Media policies
Dolan rarely speaks with members of the media and communicates to the press through released statements or in interviews with MSG Network. In 2000, Dolan instituted media training for all Garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media.[33] Under Dolan's watch MSG implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players. Some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and Knicks' beat writers from interviewing players without an MSG public relations official present, forbidding one-on-one interviews, and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the organization. The policies also forbid the MSG Network from being critical of the Knicks and the Rangers, regardless of their performance. Such measures were not standard practice for other NBA teams.[34] In addition, the Knicks did not make their medical staff available to the press.[35] In 2004, longtime broadcaster Marv Albert's contract was not renewed by MSG Network, allegedly because of his criticism of the Knicks' play.[36][37]

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
