Teluk Rubiah Maritime Terminal (TRMT) - A state of the art maritime terminal in the state of Perak, operates distribution centre for iron ore caters for Asia Pacific.

Ships[edit]
Vale has also entered the shipping business by ordering 35 Very Large Ore Carriers (VLOC) to transport iron ore between South America and Asia. These 362-metre (1,188 ft), 400,000 DWT ships are the longest and largest dry bulk carriers in the world. The first ship, Vale Brasil, was delivered in March 2011.[14]
Energy[edit]
Vale's energy business is focused at power production to fulfill the needs of its mining operations, as well as supplying the general Brazilian power grid. In 2005 it consumed 16.9 TWh of electrical power, accounting for 4.4% of Brazil's total consumption in that year.[citation needed]
Vale has participation in 8 hydroelectric plants, with 7 of these located in the state of Minas Gerais. Vale's investment in hydroelectric power plants totals $880 million.[15] The company also plans to build a 600 MW thermoeletric power plant in the state of Pará.[16]

Rebranding[edit]
In November 2007, the company retired the name CVRD in favour of simplified company name of Vale, and rebranded.[17]
History[edit]
Founded as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (widely known as CVRD prior to 2007) (in English, "Doce River Valley Company") was founded in Itabira, Minas Gerais, by the Brazilian Federal Government on 1 June 1942.[18]
One year later the Vitória a Minas railroad was inaugurated.[18]
The 1950s marked Companhia Vale do Rio Doce’s entry into the global iron ore market, after the company's mine-railroad-port complex was modernized and iron ore prices doubled. At first, sales were mostly to the United States, but exports to Europe increased over the course of the decade.[19]
In 1966, the company inaugurated in Espirito Santo the Port of Tubarão, which was to become the most important port for CVRD and is still used to export iron ore mined from the Iron Quadrangle in Minas Gerais.[18]
The company acquired a majority interest in the Carajás Mine, with over 1.5 billion tonnes of iron ore in reserves, in 1970.[20]
In 1974, Vale became the world's biggest exporter of iron ore, a title which it still holds today.[20]
In 1982, Vale began to diversify after it started to produce aluminium in Rio de Janeiro.[20]
In the mid 1980s, profits increased considerably under the leadership of Eliezer Batista, father of Eike Batista.[21]
In 1985, Vale started to explore the Carajás Mine in the state of Pará just after the 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) gauge Carajás railroad was opened.
In 1986, Ponta Madeira port terminal, which is still used to export iron ore mined at the Carajás Mine, was inaugurated in the state of Maranhão.[22]
In March 2017, Vale SA choose a commodities industry veteran, Fabio Schvartsman as chief executive officer. Schvartsman was CEO of Klabin SA, Brazil's largest paper and cardboard producer, for the past six years.[23]
Privatization in 1997[edit]
In May 1997, despite protests by Vale employees and some politicians, the Brazilian Government auctioned a 41.73% interest in the company, which was sold for R$3.34 billion (US$3.13 billion). The largest interest purchased was a 16.3% stake purchased by Brazilian steel company Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional.[24]
Sale of wood pulp businesses[edit]
In 2001, Vale sold its Cenibra wood pulp business for US$670.5 million to focus on mining and logistics.[25]

Acquisition of Caemi and acquisition and partial disposition of MBR[edit]
On 1 April 2000, Vale offered to pay Mitsui US$277 million for 50% of the common shares and US$150 million for 40% of the preferred stock in Caemi. Caemi owned MBR, Brazil's second largest iron ore producer, mining over 60 million tonnes per year.[38]
The acquisition was approved by European regulators subject to conditions.[39]

Ports and container terminals[edit]
Brazil[edit]

Port of Tubarão - Vale owns and operates this port located in Vitória, Brazil in the state of Espirito Santo.[12] It's the largest iron ore embarking port in the world.[13] Around 80 million metric tons of iron ore (30% of the company's annual production) are shipped through this port.[4]
Ponta da Madeira - Located in the state of Maranhão, it ships around 70 million metric tons mostly of iron ore, but also of manganese and copper for the company; it is being upgraded for the S11D project
Port of Sepetiba - Vale operates two maritime terminals in the Port of Sepetiba area located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, together they ship around 60 million metric tons of iron ore.

Vale also operates port terminals in the state of Sergipe and two others in the state of Espirito Santo.
Malaysia[edit]

Teluk Rubiah Maritime Terminal (TRMT) - A state of the art maritime terminal in the state of Perak, operates distribution centre for iron ore caters for Asia Pacific.

Ships[edit]
Vale has also entered the shipping business by ordering 35 Very Large Ore Carriers (VLOC) to transport iron ore between South America and Asia. These 362-metre (1,188 ft), 400,000 DWT ships are the longest and largest dry bulk carriers in the world. The first ship, Vale Brasil, was delivered in March 2011.[14]
Energy[edit]
Vale's energy business is focused at power production to fulfill the needs of its mining operations, as well as supplying the general Brazilian power grid. In 2005 it consumed 16.9 TWh of electrical power, accounting for 4.4% of Brazil's total consumption in that year.[citation needed]
Vale has participation in 8 hydroelectric plants, with 7 of these located in the state of Minas Gerais. Vale's investment in hydroelectric power plants totals $880 million.[15] The company also plans to build a 600 MW thermoeletric power plant in the state of Pará.[16]

Rebranding[edit]
In November 2007, the company retired the name CVRD in favour of simplified company name of Vale, and rebranded.[17]
History[edit]
Founded as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (widely known as CVRD prior to 2007) (in English, "Doce River Valley Company") was founded in Itabira, Minas Gerais, by the Brazilian Federal Government on 1 June 1942.[18]
One year later the Vitória a Minas railroad was inaugurated.[18]
The 1950s marked Companhia Vale do Rio Doce’s entry into the global iron ore market, after the company's mine-railroad-port complex was modernized and iron ore prices doubled. At first, sales were mostly to the United States, but exports to Europe increased over the course of the decade.[19]
In 1966, the company inaugurated in Espirito Santo the Port of Tubarão, which was to become the most important port for CVRD and is still used to export iron ore mined from the Iron Quadrangle in Minas Gerais.[18]
The company acquired a majority interest in the Carajás Mine, with over 1.5 billion tonnes of iron ore in reserves, in 1970.[20]
In 1974, Vale became the world's biggest exporter of iron ore, a title which it still holds today.[20]
In 1982, Vale began to diversify after it started to produce aluminium in Rio de Janeiro.[20]
In the mid 1980s, profits increased considerably under the leadership of Eliezer Batista, father of Eike Batista.[21]
In 1985, Vale started to explore the Carajás Mine in the state of Pará just after the 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) gauge Carajás railroad was opened.
In 1986, Ponta Madeira port terminal, which is still used to export iron ore mined at the Carajás Mine, was inaugurated in the state of Maranhão.[22]
In March 2017, Vale SA choose a commodities industry veteran, Fabio Schvartsman as chief executive officer. Schvartsman was CEO of Klabin SA, Brazil's largest paper and cardboard producer, for the past six years.[23]
Privatization in 1997[edit]
In May 1997, despite protests by Vale employees and some politicians, the Brazilian Government auctioned a 41.73% interest in the company, which was sold for R$3.34 billion (US$3.13 billion). The largest interest purchased was a 16.3% stake purchased by Brazilian steel company Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional.[24]
Sale of wood pulp businesses[edit]
In 2001, Vale sold its Cenibra wood pulp business for US$670.5 million to focus on mining and logistics.[25]

Acquisition of Caemi and acquisition and partial disposition of MBR[edit]
On 1 April 2000, Vale offered to pay Mitsui US$277 million for 50% of the common shares and US$150 million for 40% of the preferred stock in Caemi. Caemi owned MBR, Brazil's second largest iron ore producer, mining over 60 million tonnes per year.[38]
The acquisition was approved by European regulators subject to conditions.[39]
In September 2003, Vale purchased an additional stake in Caemi from Mitsui for US$426.4 million.[40]

Ports and container terminals[edit]
Brazil[edit]

Port of Tubarão - Vale owns and operates this port located in Vitória, Brazil in the state of Espirito Santo.[12] It's the largest iron ore embarking port in the world.[13] Around 80 million metric tons of iron ore (30% of the company's annual production) are shipped through this port.[4]
Ponta da Madeira - Located in the state of Maranhão, it ships around 70 million metric tons mostly of iron ore, but also of manganese and copper for the company; it is being upgraded for the S11D project
Port of Sepetiba - Vale operates two maritime terminals in the Port of Sepetiba area located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, together they ship around 60 million metric tons of iron ore.

Vale also operates port terminals in the state of Sergipe and two others in the state of Espirito Santo.
Malaysia[edit]

Teluk Rubiah Maritime Terminal (TRMT) - A state of the art maritime terminal in the state of Perak, operates distribution centre for iron ore caters for Asia Pacific.

Ships[edit]
Vale has also entered the shipping business by ordering 35 Very Large Ore Carriers (VLOC) to transport iron ore between South America and Asia. These 362-metre (1,188 ft), 400,000 DWT ships are the longest and largest dry bulk carriers in the world. The first ship, Vale Brasil, was delivered in March 2011.[14]
Energy[edit]
Vale's energy business is focused at power production to fulfill the needs of its mining operations, as well as supplying the general Brazilian power grid. In 2005 it consumed 16.9 TWh of electrical power, accounting for 4.4% of Brazil's total consumption in that year.[citation needed]
Vale has participation in 8 hydroelectric plants, with 7 of these located in the state of Minas Gerais. Vale's investment in hydroelectric power plants totals $880 million.[15] The company also plans to build a 600 MW thermoeletric power plant in the state of Pará.[16]

Rebranding[edit]
In November 2007, the company retired the name CVRD in favour of simplified company name of Vale, and rebranded.[17]
History[edit]
Founded as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (widely known as CVRD prior to 2007) (in English, "Doce River Valley Company") was founded in Itabira, Minas Gerais, by the Brazilian Federal Government on 1 June 1942.[18]
One year later the Vitória a Minas railroad was inaugurated.[18]
The 1950s marked Companhia Vale do Rio Doce’s entry into the global iron ore market, after the company's mine-railroad-port complex was modernized and iron ore prices doubled. At first, sales were mostly to the United States, but exports to Europe increased over the course of the decade.[19]
In 1966, the company inaugurated in Espirito Santo the Port of Tubarão, which was to become the most important port for CVRD and is still used to export iron ore mined from the Iron Quadrangle in Minas Gerais.[18]
The company acquired a majority interest in the Carajás Mine, with over 1.5 billion tonnes of iron ore in reserves, in 1970.[20]
In 1974, Vale became the world's biggest exporter of iron ore, a title which it still holds today.[20]
In 1982, Vale began to diversify after it started to produce aluminium in Rio de Janeiro.[20]
In the mid 1980s, profits increased considerably under the leadership of Eliezer Batista, father of Eike Batista.[21]
In 1985, Vale started to explore the Carajás Mine in the state of Pará just after the 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) gauge Carajás railroad was opened.
In 1986, Ponta Madeira port terminal, which is still used to export iron ore mined at the Carajás Mine, was inaugurated in the state of Maranhão.[22]
In March 2017, Vale SA choose a commodities industry veteran, Fabio Schvartsman as chief executive officer. Schvartsman was CEO of Klabin SA, Brazil's largest paper and cardboard producer, for the past six years.[23]
Privatization in 1997[edit]
In May 1997, despite protests by Vale employees and some politicians, the Brazilian Government auctioned a 41.73% interest in the company, which was sold for R$3.34 billion (US$3.13 billion). The largest interest purchased was a 16.3% stake purchased by Brazilian steel company Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional.[24]
Sale of wood pulp businesses[edit]
In 2001, Vale sold its Cenibra wood pulp business for US$670.5 million to focus on mining and logistics.[25]

Acquisition of Caemi and acquisition and partial disposition of MBR[edit]
On 1 April 2000, Vale offered to pay Mitsui US$277 million for 50% of the common shares and US$150 million for 40% of the preferred stock in Caemi. Caemi owned MBR, Brazil's second largest iron ore producer, mining over 60 million tonnes per year.[38]
The acquisition was approved by European regulators subject to conditions.[39]

Rebranding[edit]
In November 2007, the company retired the name CVRD in favour of simplified company name of Vale, and rebranded.[17]
History[edit]
Founded as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (widely known as CVRD prior to 2007) (in English, "Doce River Valley Company") was founded in Itabira, Minas Gerais, by the Brazilian Federal Government on 1 June 1942.[18]
One year later the Vitória a Minas railroad was inaugurated.[18]
The 1950s marked Companhia Vale do Rio Doce’s entry into the global iron ore market, after the company's mine-railroad-port complex was modernized and iron ore prices doubled. At first, sales were mostly to the United States, but exports to Europe increased over the course of the decade.[19]
In 1966, the company inaugurated in Espirito Santo the Port of Tubarão, which was to become the most important port for CVRD and is still used to export iron ore mined from the Iron Quadrangle in Minas Gerais.[18]
The company acquired a majority interest in the Carajás Mine, with over 1.5 billion tonnes of iron ore in reserves, in 1970.[20]
In 1974, Vale became the world's biggest exporter of iron ore, a title which it still holds today.[20]
In 1982, Vale began to diversify after it started to produce aluminium in Rio de Janeiro.[20]
In the mid 1980s, profits increased considerably under the leadership of Eliezer Batista, father of Eike Batista.[21]
In 1985, Vale started to explore the Carajás Mine in the state of Pará just after the 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) gauge Carajás railroad was opened.
In 1986, Ponta Madeira port terminal, which is still used to export iron ore mined at the Carajás Mine, was inaugurated in the state of Maranhão.[22]
In March 2017, Vale SA choose a commodities industry veteran, Fabio Schvartsman as chief executive officer. Schvartsman was CEO of Klabin SA, Brazil's largest paper and cardboard producer, for the past six years.[23]
Privatization in 1997[edit]
In May 1997, despite protests by Vale employees and some politicians, the Brazilian Government auctioned a 41.73% interest in the company, which was sold for R$3.34 billion (US$3.13 billion). The largest interest purchased was a 16.3% stake purchased by Brazilian steel company Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional.[24]
Sale of wood pulp businesses[edit]
In 2001, Vale sold its Cenibra wood pulp business for US$670.5 million to focus on mining and logistics.[25]

In 2006, the company acquired Rio Verde Mineracao for $47 million.[37]
Acquisition of Caemi and acquisition and partial disposition of MBR[edit]
On 1 April 2000, Vale offered to pay Mitsui US$277 million for 50% of the common shares and US$150 million for 40% of the preferred stock in Caemi. Caemi owned MBR, Brazil's second largest iron ore producer, mining over 60 million tonnes per year.[38]
The acquisition was approved by European regulators subject to conditions.[39]
In September 2003, Vale purchased an additional stake in Caemi from Mitsui for US$426.4 million.[40]

Rebranding[edit]
In November 2007, the company retired the name CVRD in favour of simplified company name of Vale, and rebranded.[17]
History[edit]
Founded as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (widely known as CVRD prior to 2007) (in English, "Doce River Valley Company") was founded in Itabira, Minas Gerais, by the Brazilian Federal Government on 1 June 1942.[18]
One year later the Vitória a Minas railroad was inaugurated.[18]
The 1950s marked Companhia Vale do Rio Doce’s entry into the global iron ore market, after the company's mine-railroad-port complex was modernized and iron ore prices doubled. At first, sales were mostly to the United States, but exports to Europe increased over the course of the decade.[19]
In 1966, the company inaugurated in Espirito Santo the Port of Tubarão, which was to become the most important port for CVRD and is still used to export iron ore mined from the Iron Quadrangle in Minas Gerais.[18]
The company acquired a majority interest in the Carajás Mine, with over 1.5 billion tonnes of iron ore in reserves, in 1970.[20]
In 1974, Vale became the world's biggest exporter of iron ore, a title which it still holds today.[20]
In 1982, Vale began to diversify after it started to produce aluminium in Rio de Janeiro.[20]
In the mid 1980s, profits increased considerably under the leadership of Eliezer Batista, father of Eike Batista.[21]
In 1985, Vale started to explore the Carajás Mine in the state of Pará just after the 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) gauge Carajás railroad was opened.
In 1986, Ponta Madeira port terminal, which is still used to export iron ore mined at the Carajás Mine, was inaugurated in the state of Maranhão.[22]
In March 2017, Vale SA choose a commodities industry veteran, Fabio Schvartsman as chief executive officer. Schvartsman was CEO of Klabin SA, Brazil's largest paper and cardboard producer, for the past six years.[23]
Privatization in 1997[edit]
In May 1997, despite protests by Vale employees and some politicians, the Brazilian Government auctioned a 41.73% interest in the company, which was sold for R$3.34 billion (US$3.13 billion). The largest interest purchased was a 16.3% stake purchased by Brazilian steel company Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional.[24]

Acquisition of Caemi and acquisition and partial disposition of MBR[edit]
On 1 April 2000, Vale offered to pay Mitsui US$277 million for 50% of the common shares and US$150 million for 40% of the preferred stock in Caemi. Caemi owned MBR, Brazil's second largest iron ore producer, mining over 60 million tonnes per year.[38]
The acquisition was approved by European regulators subject to conditions.[39]
In September 2003, Vale purchased an additional stake in Caemi from Mitsui for US$426.4 million.[40]

Thus, products that enhance these yields (such as autocall products) have become increasingly popular with investors. According to Deng et al. (2011), there has been a sharp increase in their use, with 40% annual growth recorded between 2007 and 2010. More than 2,500 autocall products were issued during the first six months of 2010. According to Baule et al. (2008), Bergstresser (2008), Deng et al. (2010) and Henderson and Pearson (2011) one of the reasons for this increase in autocall products is the ease with which they can be indexed to the products, acting essentially as a  market-linked investment that faces ‘forced redemption’ before the scheduled  maturity date if certain pre-determined market conditions are achieved. Drawing on Georgieva’s (2005) considerations regarding structured products and adapting these ideas to autocall dynamics, one may add a few more benefits of using this tool, such as: using it to hedge at a minimum or maximum level when hedging instruments are not available in the short-term market; take on risk judiciously in order to obtain higher returns; diversify in order to manage risk (in the case of autocall with more than one asset); avoid problems with potential market impact due to significant changes in asset allocation, amongst others. An autocall event occurs on pre-determined dates (which can occur at annual, quarterly intervals, etc.), specific for each type of product that can mature on the autocall date. The latter may be continuous or discrete, as shown in Figure 1(a) and (b). In the case of a continuous autocall date the product can only be autocalled when it attains the barrier during its whole duration, whereas in the discrete case there are certain ‘autocall dates’ on which the product may or may not face ‘forced redemption’ depending on its position in relation to the barrier level (the latter is characteristic of the Vale S.A. product analysed, with its predetermined dates). The underlying reference index S0 can be linked to the price of stocks, a basket of stocks or funds, amongst others such that if it reaches price level ‘C’ the company exercises the option to purchase the product, which is then automatically redeemed with the investor receiving the pre-determined coupon (initially agreed upon by contract) along with the principal invested. 


                  Autocall structured products  73                            Figure 1 Autocall in continuous and discrete periods, (a) continuous autocall (b) discrete autocall (see online version for colours)  (a) (b) Source:  CitiFirst – Informações sobre Termos e Condições In Figure 1 examples, the products were subject to autocall before the maturity date. Most autocall products have a protection feature so that if the autocall trigger has not occurred before the scheduled maturity date, the capital is fully protected and the investor receives all interest due, provided the price is greater than or equal to the barrier level. However if S is below this level, investors will be fully exposed to downside of the market and may suffer heavy losses. Thus is important to necessary to understand that the autocall product necessarily includes a put option on the maturity date. It is also interesting to observe that the ‘small’ period of time that has elapsed since its creation has seen the development of several variations of the original autocall model such as performance autocall, crescendo autocall, escalator autocall, bonus autocall and the premium express, with all of them influenced by characteristic instruments used to calculate payments on coupon dates. This article is divided into six sections. After this introduction, Section 2 presents the model developed to analyse the pricing of the autocall product issued by Vale S.A., as well as a review of the literature aimed at gaining a deeper knowledge of autocall mechanisms; the third provides a detailed explanation of the study’s title; Section 4 presents the methodology used and important data; the Section 5 shows the empirical results obtained and Section 6 presents the study’s conclusions. 2 Theoretical references This section performs an in-depth analysis of themes related to the models used for the pricing of autocall structured products, which are the trinomial tree and finite difference models. It will also focus on autocall theory itself (encompassing the most common types and their forms of payment). 2.1  Trinomial tree model The trinomial tree was introduced for the first time by Boyle (1986) and explained in Hull (2006) and Haug (1998). It is seen as constituting an extension of the binomial approach from Cox et al. (1979), and is conceptually similar. According to the trinomial 


                 74  P.V.J. da Gama Silva et al.                            method, the underlying stock is modelled as a recombination tree where the price has three possible paths at each node: upwards, downwards or stable. For standard type options, where the number of steps increases, results converge rapidly and the binomial model is then preferred due to its simple implementation. However, in the case of exotic options, the trinomial model (or adaptations) shows more stable and precise results, independently of the size of the step. According to the trinomial method, the price of the underlying stock is modelled as a recombination tree, where the price has three possible paths at each node: upwards, downwards and a stable or middle one. These values are found by multiplying the value at the current node by the appropriate factor, where: 2Tueσ××Δ= (1) 21Tde uσ−× ×Δ== (2) 1m= (3) u = price x’ s multiplicative additive increase factor d = price x’s multiplicative additive decrease factor m = price x’s multiplicative stability factor. Figure 2 illustrates the dynamics of stock prices in the trinomial tree, using n = 4 steps (for the time). Figure 2  Demonstration of the trinomial model  Source:  Rouah andVainberg (2007) 


                  Autocall structured products  75                            In order to contain all possible price movements in a trinomial tree with n steps, one needs a matrix with 2n + 1 lines and n+ 1 columns, corresponding to a size 9 × 5 matrix. The increase, decrease and stability probabilities are represented (in this order) by the following formulas: ()22222TTrqTTeePueeσσσΔΔ−×−×ΔΔ×−×⎛⎞−⎜⎟=⎜⎟−⎝⎠ (4) ()22222TTrqTTeePdeeσσσΔΔ×−×ΔΔ×−×⎛⎞−⎜⎟=⎜⎟−⎝⎠ (5) ()1Pm Pu Pd=− +  (6) where Δ t is the period of time, ơ is the volatility adopted, r is the rate of interest paid, q represents dividend payments (which in this case would is zero), and Pu and Pd are unconditionally positive. The modification of the tree for the pricing of structured products with complex variables is introduced for the first time in this study and will be detailed later in the methodology as a model which seeks to simply the calculation by adopting a processing dynamic that is low in terms of computational capacity. It should be noted that this model was chosen because, according to Anderson et al. (1997), it is clear that implicit methods require additional computation skills and their implementation can be much more difficult. Implicit methods are used in problems where the use of an explicit method would require impracticably small steps to ensure limited errors. To attain the precision sought after in such problems, much less computational time is necessary than when using an implicit method. They are usually unconditionally stable and it is thus possible to use greater values in the steps so that a solution may be found more quickly. However, the computational cost also increases considerably which in turn increases the need for extensive database processing. A modelling that is similar to the trinomial model can be found in the explicit finite difference method which will be described below. 2.2  The finite difference model According to Collatz (1966), the finite difference model is a method for solving differential equations that is based on derivate approximation by finite differences. The formulas for finite differences can be obtained by developing Taylor series – see for example, Ames (1977), Roache (1976) and Lapidus and Piner (1982). The derived finite difference operator can be obtained from the Taylor series for the function:  ( ) () ()()'2xhxxhoh+= + +∫∫∫  Thus the derivative can be written as a difference plus an error term: 


                 76  P.V.J. da Gama Silva et al.                            () ()()()'xh xxohh+−=+∫∫∫ Ignoring the error term one obtains the finite difference operator for the first derivative f defined as:  () ()()xhxDx h+−=∫∫∫ (7) According to Vista (2010), regarding precision and order, the error in the solution of a method is defined as the difference between its approximation and the exact analytical solution. The two sources of error in finite difference methods are: the rounding error (which is the loss of precision due to computational rounding of decimal amounts – which can also occur in the trinomial model, jeopardising the results of very sensitive models and the truncation error (which is the residual that results when the exact solution of the dependent variable in the discretised equation of the mathematical model is substituted). In order to use a finite difference method to try to solve or usually obtain an approximate solution of a problem, one should first discretise the domination problem. This is usually performed by dividing the domination into a uniform grid, as can be seen in Figure 3. Figure 3 Discretisation of a function on a grid (see online version for colours)  Source:  Kaw and Kalu (2009) Note that this means that finite difference methods produce discrete sets of numerical approximations for the derivative (temporally in steps). The most common examples of this method are expressed in the form of ordinary differential equations and in the heat equation. In the approach of the model used by Deng et al. (2011) for the pricing of autocall products, the authors use an explicit calculation of finite differences and partial differential equations (PDE) with the Black-Scholes formula, as presented by Zvan et al. (2000) which discusses the PDE methodology for the pricing of barrier options. It is also worth mentioning that the Monte Carlo model is another option of numerical method for the valuation of structured products. 


                  Autocall structured products  77                            2.3 Autocall According to Fries and Joshi (2011) and Georgieva (2005), the use of autocall structure products has become common in recent years, also because they act similarly to a rational investor who has a broad view of the underlying asset. According to Deng et al. (2011), the fact that most structured products were of longer term (around five years or more) was regarded as a negative factor by many investors throughout the world. An interesting way of enhancing the reduction of an investment’s duration was discovered with the use of autocall products, which according to Alexander and Sheedy (2007) essentially function like a European barrier option, in which, if at a  pre-determined future date the market is above a defined trigger level, the structure will be automatically revoked, with investors receiving their principal along with a specified return. The eight-year period since the first autocall product was produced in 2003 has seen a series of innovations that have refined the original model, which according to Citifirst (2011) are: • Performance autocall: in which the auto-call coupon is not fixed at a specific level but pays the greater of X% and the actual underlying performance in the case of an auto-call event. • Crescendo autocall: in which the auto-call event depends on two underlyings being above the autocall barrier and besides this there is an additional condition in which the second underlying provides additional financing for higher autocall coupons. • Escalator autocall: in which the auto-call barrier decreases each year – increasing the likelihood of an autocall event and reducing the probability of capital at risk. • Bonus plus autocall: in which, besides the autocall coupon received at automatic maturity, investors receive a bonus coupon (in this case the earlier in the life of the product autocall occurs, the better) so that the effective per annum coupon is high in early years compared with a standard autocall note, thus reducing the value of coupon payments towards maturity. • Premium express: in which the autocall barrier is below 100% of the initial strike level aiming to provide a high autocall probability with full capital protection. Bouzoubaa and Osseiran (2010) perform a descriptive analysis of the main autocall structures considering: payments, performance and the dispersion effect itself (also considering hypothetical explanatory scenarios in order to better understand the analyses that follow below). 2.3.1  Unique assets subject to autocall 2.3.1.1 Payments description Considering a product with autocall based in one single asset S, the structure pays a coupon that depends basically on the underlying achieving trigger levels H and B, and whose payments are defined on each observation date ti, (i = 1...n), as follows:

If a wrapper1 strategy is applied to the note the investor will receive 100% of the Invst(0). In this case, however, the payment is not fixed. The Invst(0) can be redeemed on any observation date, not necessarily at the end of the product’s life: ()()() ()()0   1, , 1  11ti tjRet HMax j i Ret HRedemption ti Invst⎡⎤⎡ ⎤≥=……− <⎢⎥⎣⎦⎣⎦=× ×  (9) In the case of the payment described above, it is important to observe that the investor does not receive an additional payment if H is achieved on one of the observation dates. So a product is considered to have been auto-called if its life-cycle is interrupted when barrier H is achieved by the underlying on a specific observation date. The autocall structure itself does not have a fixed life-cycle until maturity. Maturity, in fact, is the maximum amount of time that a product manages to remain active. The autocall trigger (H) is a pre-determined level above which the autocall structure terminates and the investor receives the Invst(0) invested. Trigger i can be fixed during the life of the product or may vary. In some cases the trigger may also increase or decrease over time. The coupon trigger (B), also known as the coupon level, is a pre-determined level above which the investor receives a periodic coupon. In other words, if the underlying observation level is greater than the coupon trigger, a coupon based on the Invst(0) is paid to the investor. The autocall and coupon triggers of some structures involving autocall are equal and are known as autocall products with knock-out coupons. However, when the coupon is paid, the product is autocalled at the same time provided the autocall trigger has been attained. Thus, this structure pays a single coupon on an observation date during the whole life of the product. In cases in which the coupon level is different from the autocall trigger, the products are known as autocall products with knock-in coupons. 2.3.1.2 Payment mechanisms This section explains the various payment mechanisms through the simulation of scenarios, shown in Tables 1 and 2 accompanied by Figures 4 and 5, with a specific case to better understand the autocall structure. Consider a retail investor in an investment bank who invests US$ 5,000 in an autocall structured product based on the CAC 40 index with a three-year duration.

If this return is greater than 70% the client receives a coupon of  US$ 400,000, which is greater than the 8% of Invst(0). In addition, if the observed level of the CAC40 index is greater than 100%, the structure is autocalled and the investor receives the money invested back.

He decided to invest ₤10 million in four banks in Belgium and Holland. This investor was offered a product composed of KBC, ING, Fortis and Dexia as in Table 3.

In the scenario presented in Figure 6, the product holder receives annual coupons based on the performance of the worst shares. At the end of the first year, all the performances of the share are above 60%, but the worst-performing share (KBC) is above 100%. Thus the first coupon is equal to 25% of Invst(0) and the structure is not autocalled as there is at least one share under 100% (which is the autocall trigger), which produces a second coupon of 25%. At maturity, one of the shares has a performance of less than 60% (FORTIS). Therefore, there is no coupon at the end of the third year and the investor receives 100% of Invst(0) on this last observation date.  


                  Autocall structured products  81                            Figure 6  Return scenarios for underlying shares based on the worst performance of autocalls  Source  Bouzoubaa and Osseiran (2010, p.199) 2.3.2.2  The snowball effect and performance based on the worst of autocalls with put options tools When the autocall and coupon triggers are the same, the product terminates immediately after the payment of the coupon. In other words, only one coupon is paid. However, coupon payments can be modified, creating the so-called ‘snowball coupons’. If the product remains active until year i, this means that the investor has not received the periodic coupons. The ‘snowball’ structure allows the investor to receive a coupon equal to the sum of all previous coupons if the trigger is achieved. The performance based on the worst autocall can also be used as a down-and-in put option tool in the autocall structure. This occurs when an investor is willing to increase the potential coupon receipt and believes that the products that comprise the basket will act above a specific level. This means that the principal is no longer protected as the investor is in a short position in relation to a put option at the product’s redemption. As in the case of autocall products for a single asset, the put option can be a European option, underlying the basket of assets with the same expiry date as the final redemption date of the autocall. 2.3.2.3  Autocall of auto-performance Considering two assets S1 and S2, the auto-performance autocall which is based on the auto-performance of two assets S1 vs S2 typically functions like a European style option with coupon payments C on each observation date, in which S1 – S2 have a specific level of auto-performance called a cushion2. This auto-performance structure possesses an auto-call tool that pays a coupon on the early redemption.

                 82  P.V.J. da Gama Silva et al.                            3  The Vale S.A. asset The Vale S.A. product is a structured note aimed at raising international funds (with a duration of at most a year), launched on the New York Stock Exchange with an autocall price of 100% of the initial price, coupon barrier set at 80% of the initial price and  knock-in level at 80% of the initial price. This product’s initial price was established on 03/04/2011, based on VALE’s closing price of U$ 34.50 (to two decimal points) taken from the Bloomberg database, which will mature on 04/02/2012. Thus the auto-call, coupon barrier and knock-in level prices are US$ 34.50, US$ 27.60 and US$ 27.60 respectively. The autocall validation dates are fixed monthly, as can be seen in Table 4. Table 4  Validation dates of the asset Autocall provision Valuation date  Mandatory early redemption date April 18, 2011   Valuation date + five business days May 18, 2011  Valuation date + five business days June 20, 2011  Valuation date + five business days July 18, 2011  Valuation date + five business days August 18, 2011  Valuation date + five business days September 19, 2011  Valuation date + five business days October 18, 2011  Valuation date + five business days November 18, 2011  Valuation date + five business days December 19, 2011  Valuation date + five business days January 18, 2012  Valuation date + five business days February 21, 2012  Valuation date + five business days March 19, 2012  Final valuation date Source: CitiFirst (2011) This issue pays 0.917% interest per month (approximately 11% a year) on the principal. If the price on the autocall date is equal to or greater than the autocall price, forced redemption occurs and investors receive their principal plus the respective month’s interest due, terminating the investment. If the product does not reach the autocall barrier and if it is above the coupon barrier and the knock-in level on the autocall date, interest is paid. When the price is below the autocall level and the coupon barrier and knock-in levels, the investor continues remaining invested but does not receive the respective month’s interest. If the product is not autocalled during its life cycle and  reaches the scheduled maturity date, there are three possible scenarios to consider: in the first the price is above the autocall barrier, coupon barrier and knock-in level prices (in this case investors receive the principal plus this last month’s interest); in the second, the price is below the autocall level but above the coupon barrier and knock-in level (in this case interest is paid, although the underlying’s return is negative); in the third case, in which the price is below the autocall level, the coupon barrier and the knock-in level (in this worst case 


                  Autocall structured products  83                            scenario the investor is exposed fully to the downside as the company is has bought a put option). 4  Database and methodology This chapter was divided into two sections. The first part describes the database used in the treatment of information and the second part presents the methodology used for the calculations that formed the basis for this study’s results. 4.1 Database The database was obtained from two distinct sources: Bloomberg, according to the  data entry parameters described by Citigroup Funding Inc. in the issue contract of this Vale S.A. structured product and ECONOMÁTICA. The entry data in the model are composed of the start price of US$ 34.50 (obtained from Bloomberg on 03/04/2011) which automatically generated other data such as the autocall (US$ 34.50) knock-in and the coupon barrier (US$ 27.60). The coupon paid (stipulated by contract) is 11% per year which can generate monthly payments of 0.917% if the product’s price is at conditional levels that provide for this payment, as explained above. The main volatility (ơ) of the model is 0.36 (considering historical volatility – obtained from the price database of ECONOMÀTICA), and varies between 0.10 and 1.00 (for experimental modelling) in order to note the pricing discrepancies due to it – which is the only conditional variable that can be manipulated to influence this product’s pricing. 4.2 Methodology The analysis covers the 12-month period from the start price established for Vale S.A. (VALE) stock, on 03/04/2011, so that this product’s data inputs (coupon barrier, knock-in and autocall) begin at this start price. The modifications in the trinomial tree include the coupon barrier, knock-in and autocall conditions, as well as the dynamics of the calculation of the note’s present value taking these conditions into consideration. I should be mentioned that the trinomial tree model proposed is exactly that one of Hull (2006). Changes were only incorporated in the present value calculation and in the inclusion of the conditional coupon barrier knock-in and autocall. The coupon payments, based on the capital invested are brought to present value according to the price’s position in the tree, that is, its position at the node. Thus, one can note that the conditions should be analysed on an individual basis for each tree node. It should also be noted that the underlying asset assumes a geometric Brownian motion. In order to achieve a better understanding an illustrative model is generated in  Figure 7, considering that the product has a maximum life of three months. 


                 84  P.V.J. da Gama Silva et al.                            Figure 7  Demonstration of the calculation of the modified trinomial model  This example considered an initial price (P0) of US$ 34.50, autocall level of US$ 34.50 and coupon barrier and knock-in level of US$ 27.60, and used a volatility of 0.2 (or 20%). The underlined values show the coupon payments due according to the Vale S.A. product’s conditions and the values in bold-type refer to the present value of the coupon paid. Thus, the value in bold-type noted below the initial price is the product’s final present value (which is the sum of the all other values in bold-type). During the first period, it can be observed that the price of $ 37.44 exceeds the autocall barrier and the price of $ 34.50 attains it and thus they are redeemed and the principal plus interest $ 1,000 * 1.0917 = $ 1,009.17 are rescued, so that the subsequent calculation for this ‘node’ is no longer needed since the product finished in this part of the tree. The present value is then generated as follows:

Applying equation (13) the amount paid of $ 1,009.17 * (the probability of rising 0.2950) * Exp [–Ln (1.11) * (1/12)] = $ 295.14. As stated above present values are obtained according to the position of the node, that is, taking as an example the value of US$ 31.80 in the second period, the payment is $ 9.17 ($ 1000 * 0.0917), because the barrier of autocall was not reached (only the interest payments), and thus the calculation of the PV value for this kind of situation will change to: ()()()()()   121rPV Principal Cumulative probability for each nodenExp Ln r T⎡⎤=××⎢⎥⎣⎦⎡⎤×−+×⎣⎦ (14) Applying equation (14) the amount paid of $ 9.17 * (the probability of falling 0.2087 * the probability of remaining stable 0.4963) * Exp [–Ln (1.11) * (2/12)] = $ 0.93. In the example in Figure 7 no price in period 1 and 2 was below the barrier coupon payment of $ 27.60. Should this occur, the interest payment would be zero and the calculation of the product would continue to be done. Period three, in this illustrative example, has the same conditional as period 12. Thus, it is clear that if the price closes above the barrier during the last period, the investor obtains the principal plus interest and if it closes below the coupon barrier Vale S.A is in fact buying a put option and the buyer is short – the calculation is:  0     TPrincipalClosing Below the Coupon Barrier PP⎛⎞=×⎜⎟⎝⎠ (15) Appling the equation (15) (1,000 / 34.50) * 27.00 = 782.62. In order to automate the calculation process a calculation methodology was developed that seeks to exploit the product’s conditionals with the matrix idea for the work with the database (using the computer language VBA in Excel). The Vale S.A. prices used to calculate historical volatility were obtained on a daily basis during the 12 months prior to the issue of the note, from the ECONOMATICA database. They were adjusted for dividends but not for inflation (a value of 0.36 or 36% was found). Historical volatility, according to, da Silva (2008), corresponds to the standard deviation of the natural logarithms of the between consecutive periods. It iscalculated as follows: 


                 86  P.V.J. da Gama Silva et al.                            1 Calculatel n (Pi / Pi–1) for each period, where Pi is the closing price of period i and Pi–1 is the same closing price of the previous period. 2  Calculate the standard deviation of the values calculated in item 1 for the n periods that precede the period considered (n is a parameter of the indicator). 3  Annualise the volatility obtained in item 2. For example, if the values of item 1 are on a daily basis, multiply the standard deviation of item 2 by the square root of 252 (where 252 = the approximate number of business days in a year). Some pricing scenarios will be structured using volatility as the basis for the analysis of the product during this period. 5 Results Through a structured analysis, as can be seen in Table 5, the research developed scenarios considering different maturities of 1 to 12 months for the Vale S.A. product, as well as a volatility that varied from 0.1 to 1 (also considering a historical volatility of 0.36).

Moreover, the highest price of all the simulations – US$ 1,000.62 – occurs in this same volatility scenario from the seventh to the tenth period. It is important to note that the increase in volatility leads to a significant decline in prices (with the lowest – US$ 900.79 – found in the scenario of 100% volatility during the first period. During the first period it can be observed that there is a greater degree of ‘indifference’ in pricing due to the variation of volatility (in the cases of volatilities of 10% to 50% prices remain constant at US$ 1,000.43). The margin of price variation, considering their deviation by period, is greater at the first redemption than at the others, with the lowest being during the last period, as prices are then declining. It can also be observed that with very low volatility of say 10% and high volatility of 60% to 100%, the price of the longer maturity note is greater than one with a shorter duration. The contrary occurs when volatility is between 20% and 50%. Therefore, the ideal for autocall structured products is precisely a short maturity (with redemption occurring during the first months of the product’s life) in an environment of moderate volatility so that an investor can seek similar products and obtain a profit.

Figure 8  Real product pricing considering the validation dates and realised periods  Source: Own calculus Observing the product’s actual behaviour, it can be seen that investors incurred losses, in as much as: the product completed its lifecycle, had coupon non-payment dates and on the final date the price was below the barrier and the knock-in level – which led to a greater exposure on the part of investors who faced a loss of 31% at the end. As regards the pricing of the product, in as much as price volatility during the period attained  40%, considering  daily prices in dollars from 03/04/11 to 03/19/12, as well as dividends) in the scenarios cited in Table 5, the product has a present value of  US$ 970.92. 6 Conclusions This study sought to describe various features of the autocall structure in complex products which involve differentiated methodologies due to various details of calculation (as mentioned above in the typology of this product) in an appropriate pricing model. As seen above, volatility, due to autocall, influences the pricing of these products in a very peculiar fashion – which, according to the interval analysed for the total life of the product (12 months) varies between US$ 1,000.61 and US$ 902.25. Thus, one may note that volatility acts as the main measure of dispersion of the product’s returns. It was observed in this study that the use of a reliable model to price autocall products that is concerned with being agile enough to process large databases in order to maintain the data accuracy necessary to ensure the adequate functioning of these structured products, enables investors to assess whether the product’s return (according to its historic volatility) is over or underestimated. Therefore, based on the information collected or scenarios developed, investors will be able to undertake their operations (which may be hedging, arbitrage or speculative 


                  Autocall structured products  89                            operations – depending on the type of product).

Vale S/A Revenue and Financial Data


   Vale has more than just one iron in the fire. Iron ore and pellets account for more than two-thirds of Vale's sales, and the company accounts for a third of the world's ocean-shipped iron ore. Vale also mines for bauxite, nickel, kaolin, and potash. Other products include steel, copper, and aluminum. It has holdings in hydroelectric power generation and in the rail and shipping businesses, mainly to support its mining activities in Brazil. The company is the world's second-largest iron ore miner, having grown dramatically with the 2006 acquisition of Vale Limited (formerly Vale Inco). To raise cash, in late 2016 Vale agreed to sell its fertilizer business to Mosaic for $2.5 billion.

Abstract This article analyses the pricing, using autocall mechanisms, of a coupon barrier note issue based on ADRs of Brazil’s biggest mining and metals company: Vale S.A. (VALE). The numerical method used was based on a modification of the trinomial tree model with auto-call, barrier and knock-in conditions, and which was modified to calculate present value. This model was shown to be practical and agile for processing the database and handling considerably volatile scenarios and was also validated by the product’s actual behaviour, revealing that the product was not financially attractive for maintaining an autocall operation strategy (achieve a gain with the product maturing in the short term and switch to similar products). The aim of this article is to show a new pricing method involving autocall structured products with functioning typologies similar to those of the issue analysed in the present study. Keywords: Keywordsfinancial derivatives, structured products, autocall, Vale S.A., VALE, modified trinomial tree, finite difference method
