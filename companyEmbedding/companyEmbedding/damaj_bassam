Thank you, and good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. My name is Kerry Ahearn, I'm the Director of Communications at Chesapeake Group and we provide Investor Relations for Innovus Pharmaceuticals. And with me today from Innovus is President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Bassam Damaj; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Robert E. Hoffman; and Vice President of Finance, Mr. Rauly Gutierrez.
During today's call, management will provide a brief overview of the company's progress in the third quarter, as well as provide a corporate roadmap for our 2016. Our management is also going to provide an overview of the financial statements and discuss the product pipeline. I will then open up the line for any questions you may have.
I'd like to remind everyone that certain information discussed on today's conference call is covered under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. And that during today's conference call, management will be making some certain forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company, including statements relating to the expectations around the timing for the commercial launch of products, the timing of outcomes of clinical trial results, and the regulatory approval process of Innovus Pharma product candidates, business development, plans and objectives such as out-licensing and acquiring products and product candidates, the amount and source of future revenues, expected use of cash reserves, and the development of the company's products pipeline. Such statements are predictions based upon current expectations and actual results could differ materially.
Please refer to the company's most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Innovus Pharmaceuticals' Annual and Quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q for additional discussions regarding these and other risks that may affect the company's business. These documents can also be found on the company's website at innovuspharma.com.

This is an approximately a 950% increase from the previous period last year.
In addition, we reported a total of $3.1 million in revenues for the nine month ended in September 2016, which is nearly 500% increase from the previous period last year. The team has done a tremendous job in integrating our products under the Beyond Human sales and marketing platform which resulted in having now several products generating revenues including the Beyond Human Testosterone, the Vesele Sensum product, Zestra and RecalMax.

The company’s revenues to date put us on track for revenues of $5 million for the whole of 2016 and we are confirming our guidance of $15 million in revenues for 2016 and we currently project profitability next year.
Please note, that our projected 15 million in revenues for 2017 does not include $10 million to $15 million in projected revenues from FlutiCare if approved by the FDA by the end of 2016 and launch by the second quarter of 2017.
It is just impressive to see how the company had drown from $735,000 in revenues for 2015 to 3.1 million year-to-date and tracking to $5 million for 2016. We are efficiently utilizing our Beyond Human sales and platform and integrating our products under this platform and the results speak for themselves.
Revenues have been growing at 42% growth rate month-over-month. This is 42% growth rate month-over-month since our Beyond Human acquisition also our growth margins have grown to over 82% which is a testimony to the laser focused execution of our business plan.
The fast and continuous growth reported speaks first to the strengths of our Beyond Human sales and marketing platform and second to our ability to integrate as many of our products under this platform. This is a very efficient and powerful platform that reaches between $20 million to $30 million potential customers on a monthly basis.
And here I would like to note again that the $15 million in projected revenues for 2016 does not include any revenues from the projected launch of FlutiCare if and when approves by the FDA and launch in the second quarter in 2017 nor does it include any additional products the company may acquire or license in the future.
And before I move into discussing our corporate advances and progress, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Robert Hoffman to discuss the financial results in details. Robert?
Robert Hoffman
Thank you, Bassam. As Bassam mentioned, we recorded revenues in the third quarter and nine months of 2016 totaling $1.9 million and $3.1 million respectively. Products continuing to our revenues included BTH Testosterone Booster, Vesele, Sensum+, Zestra and RecalMax. We continue to believe we will achieve $5 million in revenues for all of 2016.
Equally impressive and perhaps more our growth margins for the quarter were 82%, up sequentially 8% from the second quarter of 2016 and significantly higher than our first quarter 2016 gross margins of 47%. We believe this highlights a strength of our Beyond Human platform and the efficiencies we’ve be able to create by adding our existing products such as Zestra, RecalMax and Sensum+ into the platform. We will continue to look for ways to optimize our growth margins in the following quarters into 2017.
Sales and marketing expense increased to $2 million in the third quarter and total $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This is primarily driven by the cost of integrating our existing products in the Beyond Human sales and marketing platform and increase in a number of print and online media advertisements of our existing products truth Beyond Human platform.
The increases also attributable to increased cost in sales and marketing, support services due to the higher volume of sales orders received as a result of the Beyond Human asset acquisition in the integration of more products into this platform.
We expect to see this moderate as a percentage of sales going forward as we see customers utilizing more and more the subscription model to purchase our products. General and administrative expenses increased to $1.8 million in the third quarter and totaled $4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
These amounts did however include non-cash stock-based compensation totaling $0.7 million in the third quarter and $1.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These amounts also include a non-cash amortization expense of $0.2 million in the third quarter and $0.5 million in nine months ended September 30, 2016.

At September 30, 2016 our cash balances grew to $1.5 million compared to $56,000 at the end of 2015. Our cash balances were strengthened by the $3 million financing we completed in the third quarter. We continued to be focused on our goals of expanding our product line by further leveraging our Beyond Human sales and marketing platform and achieving our goal of profitability in 2017 with $15 million in revenues in 2017 before taking into any revenues from FlutiCare, ex-US sales, revenues from potential companies we made purchase or the un-licensing of any additional future products 
With that, I turn the call back over to Bassam
Bassam Damaj
Thank you, Robert.
I’d like to summarize what we have accomplished during the third quarter. I think it is important to understand that the management has been diligently working towards achieving our two main goals. First, reaching profitability in 2017 with $15 million in revenues and I believe the growth we have been experiencing and the revenues reports speaks for itself.
One, our month-to-month growth since our Beyond Human acquisition is over 42% now and our margins are 82% and we are continuously adding more products and expanding our commercial territories outside the US and we are confident with our ability to achieve this goal.
The second goal is to uplift to a NASDAQ but under the right market conditions. And this is a very important point for the management as we continuously – continue to diligently evaluate the market conditions along with our share price and the shareholder equity to move forward our listing process.
As I mentioned in previous calls and interviews, we will do the uplift one and only if it is the optimal time for the company and the shareholders and when we see a better appreciation in our share price. What have we accomplished in 2016? All I can tell you that we have accomplished quite a bit in 2016, and some of the most important highlights over the last quarter's include first, which I think is a very important actually accomplishment that we have done. We have announced the initiation of the preclinical and clinical program intended to revaluate the safety and efficacy of combination of our supplement, result for promoting sexual health with sildenafil sold at Viagra in the US by Pfizer and is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.
With Vesele, clinically shown to increase erection hardness and maintenance, two important components of the erectile dysfunction in Men and while it is continuing to be our best revenue performer to date the company is investing in the combination studies with sildenafil non-responders in order to capture a larger market of segment of the market.
As you may know, Phosphodiesterase 5 or PDE5 inhibitor which include drugs like Viagra and Cialis Levitra are shown to induce an erection in patients but those patients still have issues in the maintenance and hardness of their erection hence why a product like Vesele comes in handy.
Additionally, close to 50% of patients rotate between the approved drugs like Viagra, Cialis, Levitra until they drop out completely from either the lack of response or the increase in the side effects from the higher doses they need to take.
So the ongoing studies, if positive should allow us to address the potential of combining sildenafil and Vesele for the patients currently either non-responsive anymore to those drugs or taking those drugs. Now pending positive results from the combination, we would expect Vesele revenues to capture a much larger market or segment of the overall market of the erectile dysfunction.
As we all know the erectile dysfunction market is about $5 billion market. So we would like to be able to capture as much as we can from such a big market and there is a big need to compliment the current PDE5 or erectile dysfunction drug approved in the market.

The second item as we entered into an exclusive license agreements with Seipel Group for the rights to market, the Urox Formulation which has been clinically proven to reduce, Urinary Urgency, accidents and both day and night frequency in Overactive Bladder and in urine incontinence UI. And this product will be marketed under the name of UriVa Rx.
The overall market of the Overactive Bladder is a very large market, and I think it is important to know that this product has sold over $1 million in the US last year and due to the double-blind clinical trial showing very strong and statically significantly results and to our robust Beyond Human Sales and Marketing Platform, we expect to add about $3 million in revenues from this product to our total revenues.
Third, we announced the launch of Sensum+, our product to increase penile sensitivity under the Beyond Human Sales and Marketing platform and I'm happy to report that the Sensum sales are growing and in a very short period of time, this product has become a good seller for us and now it's part of our core product offerings.
Fourth, we announced the launch of our brain health supplement, RecalMax, under the Beyond Human Sales and Marketing Platform in the U.S., RecalMax has been shown to increase effort and focus. And now we are not targeting a very large market and we are very pleased with the growth the product has shown under our Beyond Human Sales and Marketing Platform.
Fifth, we actually increased our management with the addition of Robert Hoffman as our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer as you may have seen from Robert's bio he is very experienced executive not just in the financial arena but also in the operations, manufacturing and pharma space. We are very happy with the addition of Robert to our team and we look forward to now to working together to continue to improve our margins, increase our sales and achieve our two main goals.
We then closed on $3 million of financing in July and I think this is very important because this financing was very helpful for us in acquiring more products like Rx products for example and increasing our sales and marketing efforts which resulted in our 950% increase in revenues for the third quarter of this year.
And lastly, we continue our preparation for the launch of FlutiCare in 2017 if approved by the FDA. The management is very confident on the prospects of an approval by the FDA and we are working diligently on the launch plan and structure not just in the retail space and storage but also under our Beyond Human Sales and Marketing Platform as currently the market since the Rx switch has been moving towards a subscription model versus a one unit purchase from the source. 
And as you know, our Beyond Human Platform is very powerful and can reach between 20 million to 30 million potential customers on a monthly basis. And we believe, FlutiCare if approved by the FDA will do very well under our platform with little competition since as you may all know the retail stores that currently will carry such product not actually in a position to offer subscription more of the product to their customers and this is where actually our platform and our infrastructure allow us to commence with lesser competition in the space.
Now returning to our financial results in the third quarter, so in this third quarter we reported a very strong performance that reflect growth across several of our products and this is very important, we were no longer a one product company that is trading most of their revenues, we have now a mix of products that includes Vesele Beyond the Human testosterone booster, Zestra, Sensum+, and RecalMax and we look forward to adding to this platform, the launch of the Zestra Multi-Dose and under this platform the UriVarx, our UriVarx product and additional product in order to keep growing our revenues and reach our $15 million in projected revenues in 2017 and our profitability.

So over the past couple of years, we have really worked hard to shape the quality of the assets in our pipeline, this is very important, we can have any company that has a good sales platform will not do much without strong assets and I believe we now have a very competitive, well known pipeline of commercial and in-development assets that are positioned to deliver new breakthroughs to customers and patients over the next few years.
Similarly over the past nine months, our business has gained a strong direct to consumer sales and marketing platform. A sharper build is focused increase accountability and a greater ability to capture the opportunities within the product unique markets. 
I think it is very important for a company to be able to offer multiple products for targeting the same therapeutic area and this allows companies like us; you know to offer the same, the same consumers, different products targeting different parts of the same segments. As the conclusion now as look ahead we will continue to follow this strong clinically validated products we bring in that will enable us to take on sort of the world's greatest health challenges. 
This is why business development remains an important priority in achieving our goals. Our appetites for business development and mergers and acquisitions have not changed. We continue to seek the best opportunities and collaborations with the right financial evaluation to augment our portfolio and pipeline. And in closing our performance in the quarter position us well to continue to invest in our business and to deliver a balanced differentiated portfolio of medicines and consumer products that will allow us to generate long-term growth and sustainable value for our shareholders and for society as a whole.
And with this, I would like to thank you for listening to our call and I’ll pass on for the Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Daniel, Private Investor. Please go ahead.
Daniel
Hello, Bassam. Congratulations on the super quarter. 
Bassam Damaj
Thank you.
Daniel
My question has to do with the possible approval FlutiCare and how you feel about that as far as your own corporate timing, I know you can't predict when or if it will come but you have any thoughts about when it may happen internally.
Bassam Damaj
So as, FlutiCare is a very important asset for the company and we are still on the same guidance that we are very hopeful for an approval before the end of the year for the product. Again as we said, we can never actually, give a shorter answer, improvement approved but the management is very confident about the prospect of a approval of the product and hopefully before the end of the year and if that happens actually that will allow us to launch the product in the second quarter of 2017.
And again as just I think it’s important to understand that actually the company is really I think we are waiting for an approval probably more than patients than the shareholder as really this is a very big product for us as we believe this is going to add to us $10 million to $15 million and revenues on top of our projected revenues in 2017 so, we are really looking forward for a positive approval from the FDA for this product. 
Daniel
And a follow on question about FlutiCare has to do with your potential market and knowing that it’s on retail shelves right now for example and you’re just addressing the subscription model can you talk a little bit more about any added value that your subscription model will bring and also what your internal views are as far as how long someone may stay on the subscription and if perhaps it could be seasonal. 
Bassam Damaj
So first of all I think the first understand that FlutiCare access is actually - fluticasone propionate nasal, which is actually indicated for non-allergic rhinitis. So it’s not a seasonal product. People who have non-allergic rhinitis, they have to take the product all the time. And this is actually where the subscription actuary model comes in.

So as you know since the switch from RX to OTC, although you see the products and shelves, GSK reported $110 million revenues for the first quarter then continuously accelerate further an increase in revenues, they are reported $175 million from the launch. So this is a very big market, which actually becoming over $1 billion in the U.S.
But what is important to understand, I mean patients who use this drug, they’re not actually anymore going to the pharmacy for a prescription at a one-time. They are now actually - the model is switching to a subscription model where a patient, which are now we call them consumer actually orders once a month actually a spray, and then subscribe for the whole year and then receive the product to his home or actually we would be able to offer five actuary product at the same time or even more.
So we look at this as a continuous use of this product by the patients and actually working frankly to keep that as long as possible on the subscription model as once you put it a consumer on subscription model, actually now you have eliminated a lot of the sales and marketing costs. There is actually now bigger margins, there is now a bigger adherence to the brand as to the use, there is an ease for that person to receive the product where he is sitting home and doesn’t have and say, oh my God, I don’t have any more actually quality in my drug, I have to go out and buy another one.
So I think this is really where we come in, in our actually Beyond Human Sales and market Platform because we’re able to reach a very, very large number of people on a monthly basis, 20 million to 30 million people on a monthly basis is a very large number. So basically now those people - a lot of those people are used to this four multi products that we have - that are using as a prescription.
And then they’re going to see it coming to them now and in OTC for they're used do it, they’re comfortable with it, and we’ll be able to actually offer them the subscription mode where they can say, I’m going to subscribe for this six months, for three months, for one year in order to continuously keep getting the products.
And this is where actually I think important to note that with the Company looking to increase our actually offering FlutiCare with additional complementing product, we will be able to offer more product as a package to this consumer whereas allergic rhinitis, a lot of patients have for example, a lot of eye irritation, so you have to take eye drop, a lot of them have a nasal, still they have to clear up their nasal with spaces.
So there is a lot of additional complementary products that we can add to that and offer to the same consumer without actually adding any more marketing costs. So this is where the efficiency of our platform and our subscription model comes in. This is where we can increase our margins now without the need to be going and competing with GKS, competing with Bayer or competing with other products. So this is where we see ourselves actually have an advantage over the shelf space.
Having said that, please note that we publically have to report that [indiscernible] has actually closed to 30,000 stores actually has went up of record already actually in place. So we have actually the retails that we will choose from with our products and we have the advantage of our Beyond Human platform and our online platform, which should not be taken lightly as now our subscribers to our website are over 1.5 million subscribers to all our website and this is where we’re able to reach an simple e-mail blast coming to them, offering them actually the products. So I hope this answers your questions.
Daniel
It does. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question for today is [indiscernible] from the Chesapeake Group. Please go ahead.

Unidentified Analyst
Hi, this is [indiscernible] with Chesapeake Group. And a question for you, basically I want to know as far as the proxy what's the reason for that increase in shares?
Bassam Damaj
So this is a very good question, I’m glad that you asked this question. So I think the important for the shareholders to know, the Company currently has 160 million shares authorized to each one. We have a little bit over a 100 million shares that are outstanding.
When we did the last round of financing as part of the publically filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we were required to reserve 40 million shares on that actuary document in order to allow the converse that takes place.
So this is a reserve that we can touch, which actually puts us actuary at not a high number. Adding to that the company truly believes of the potential approval of the FDA before the end of the year and as you know once the FDA approval comes in, we do actually all [indiscernible] shareholder the rest of their shares to be issued when we did the acquisition of the Company.
So basically the main reason actually why we did this is to be able to have enough shares actually to be able to continues to execute on our business plan that we have shown it for example acquiring products and without the need to go and pay cash for it, or actually potentially use our actuary start for additional acquisition.
So the company has to have actuary shares and up shares outstanding to be able to continue to execute. And this was actually the main reason why we needed to increase our number of authorized share and it's not actually for other reasons as we stated in the proxy.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator
Our next questioner is Ed Stokes with Chesapeake. Please go ahead.
Ed Stokes
Good afternoon Dr. Bassam, how are you today?
Bassam Damaj
Hi, Ed. How are you doing?
Ed Stokes
Great. Curious about up listing timing - sort of strongly moving to a higher exchange?
Bassam Damaj
So a higher exchange has a lot of advantages [indiscernible]. We built the company to be a NASDAQ Company. We did not build the Company, the way the structure is, the product, the way the revenues are growing to stay on the bulletin board.
But and as I said in several actuary interviews and I publicly said it out there, we will not uplift to just uplift. I do not like the reverse splits and I think the shareholders have to know something and to go through the history of the Company. I actually invested and put in the company $2.5 million as a line of credit from my own money when I came in. I am the largest - single largest shareholder in the Company and I converted a lot of those money actually at $0.40.
So I think it is important to me when I speak now, I'm not speaking as a CEO of the Company, but I’m speaking as a shareholder similar to the thousands of the shareholders we have out there is that as a shareholder, I do not like to see a reverse split. I like to be able to minimize that effect and I will wait until the market conditions are right, until my share price is actually at much appreciated and until our shareholders equity actuary could meet to the requirement by NASDAQ and then we will look it’s up listing in the NASDAQ.
I think this is very important point. I know lot of shareholders actually we do receive [indiscernible] they were about the reverse split when it’s coming we are not going to do a reverse split on uplift, just to uplift, we will only uplift when the time is right for the Company and for the shareholders.
So I think this is very important to keep in mind. Here I am talking not as the CEO of the company, but as the largest single shareholder of the Company. So I am the same size as the shareholder here. I hope that answer the question.

Ed Stokes
Yes, it does. And I just have one other question is, it sounds as if the Beyond Human Products are the best performing products at present time. Would you say the growth is organic or will be from additional products?
Bassam Damaj
So Beyond Human - there are two things we have to understand, Beyond Human sales and marketing platform, right which under we sell most of our products and then we have the Beyond Human Testosterone [indiscernible] that is a very good seller for the Company.
But as I mentioned we have integrated now four additional products into this platform and now actually - is actually our lead performer right now as we publically said.
And again we are seeing the growth, not just organic, but also integrating all the products we have to add us on the sales platform. And here I want to actually give a very important example of how successful we've been able to integrate that and how powerful this platform is. To give you an example, this Vesele product, we have which is the best seller product now and as you would see we said we from the first quarter that Vesele and the Beyond Human Testosterone added about 90% of all our products right now and Vesele keep to be over performing.
This is a product that have actually purchased for $40,000 actually about a year ago. We’re selling 200 units and as I said in the previous presentation that I had this product right now, sells about 300 units a day. This is how strong this platform is. We are able to reach so many people and those types of people we reach are people that actually are used to be able to look at those editorials, look at those print media, they go online. This is the type of product they want and we’re able to reach so many of them.
So it shows you how we took a product that was selling 200 units a year to sell now 300 units a day. So the growth, yes, the growth is organic because this product we had before, but also we are adding more products to the pipeline. So it’s really a combination of organic growth and adding more products to the pipeline.
Ed Stokes
Great, better than I’ve thought. Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next questioner today is Robert Scott, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.
Robert Scott
Hello, Bassam, how are you doing today?
Bassam Damaj
Fine, thank you Robert.
Robert Scott
Yes, your growth had been quite commendable and I am sure you’ve had quite a busy quarter this third quarter. Congratulations to you.
Bassam Damaj
Thank you.
Robert Scott
With all that being so busy, I was just wondering if you guys are still on track to expend your FlutiCare franchise by adding more products there.
Bassam Damaj
Definitely, I mean as I said the FlutiCare is a very important asset for us. There are a lot of products that can be added around the FlutiCare franchise. We are diligently working to adding more products. As I said publicly, we are always evaluating and discussion and focus of our product and I hope that we will be able to actually to announce in the near future additional product around the FlutiCare franchise.
This is very important for us and as you know we are very strong in the business development area, the mergers and acquisitions. So we’re always looking for product to add and we’ve added a lot of products on a weekly basis. So we are very confident of our ability as to expand that franchise very fast and hopefully before actually we even launched that product into the market.
Robert Scott
And a quick follow-up, I was looking for you to elaborate a little on you reported earlier, a big increase in these prepaid expenses and I was just wondering how this is related to this increase in inventory and just making sure you got enough supply out there to feed this enormous ramp up in demand?
Bassam Damaj

Very good, yes, and as we reported we had about a lot of prepaid expenses that we had in the company and that actually stems directly from really most of that increase actually prepaid expenses related to product inventory, which is very important. Our reported result for example it’s doing about 300 units a day. So you can imagine how much inventory we have to keep on hand.
We have Vesele. We have Beyond Human Testosterone. We have Sensum. We have Xyralid. We have RecalMax. We have a very strong pipeline. So the management has taken a decision here really aiming to taking some of the money we have and invest in enough adventure, enough to have – in order to have a cutaneous supply, so this where a lot of the bulk of the prepaid expenses comes in.
There is a lot if associated actually expenses that goes within as you know the product liabilities and so forth and ensures us that you have to prepay and so forth. So these – lot of those actually prepaid expenses that you see in this quarter will carry a lot to the next quarter. So it’s very important. So it’s not just a prepaid expense for this quarter, unfortunately we had to put them in this quarter to take on that expense, but a lot of those actually are for several months to come.
And the last part of your question, we do have enough supply of the product as we have a very actually now we have multiple supply of them and many faster sell product and we do maintain what’s called a MIL, which is a minimum inventory level of each product in there where once we reach that level that we have and automatic actually deal goes out to our manufacturers to start on the new batch in order really to continuously have enough supply.
Robert Scott
That’s awesome and I’ve had many enquiries. People are very interested in getting online there and ordering your product. And one thing I am noticing, I am going from $5 million in revenue this year and next year $15 million, but with this added FlutiCare, we’re thinking, I am thinking this thing to be like over $30 million in revenue for you next year. Is that a possibility or are we being low in that number?
Bassam Damaj
I always would like to be conservative and this is very important. When we moved from our first quarter, we did about $200,000 in Q1 of this year and we said what we’ve acquired this one and we got actually increase our revenue, people were asking, I said I don’t know what they’re going to do.
Second quarter we reported over $1 million of revenues. And then again people think maybe this is a one-time thing they were able to do it. We reported now $1.9 million revenue and $1.9 million in revenue actually if you look at it, if you look at the $1.9 million revenue we did this quarter, this is almost three months. So you can now estimate how much we’re doing monthly actually on those products. And we reported we’re doing a 42% increase month-to-month.
So basically I would like to be conservative again with any management you would like to beat the estimate, but our actually guidance is $15 million 2015. If we get the approval from the FDA for FlutiCare, yes, we’re looking to add another $10 million to $15 million for 2017 and that actually will take us into the number you have suggested, but only if we get the approval for FlutiCare. So we’re very actually – this I why we keep working diligently on really preparing the potential launch of the FDA of the FlutiCare, while we await for a decision from the FDA.
Robert Scott
Thank you. I am very excited to be board. I can’t wait for this fourth quarter and see the numbers and next year, so it’s an exciting ride all the way around.
Bassam Damaj
Thank you. Thank you, I appreciate that. I appreciate the support.

And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dr. Bassam Damaj. Dr. Damaj?
Bassam Damaj
Thank you, Kerry. Good afternoon, everyone.
In the first quarter 2017, we drove growth across many areas of our portfolio, which enabled us to grow revenues 10x from $200,000 in first quarter 2016 to $2.2 million in the first quarter 2017. And grow our product pipeline from four products to 18 commercial products.
Looking forward, we remain confident in reaching profitability exiting 2017 from the ongoing performance of our key franchises and core brands as well as the growing momentum behind our growing pipeline expanding territories and partnerships for our products, new product introductions and major product launches including FlutiCare, which we just announced our deed with West-Ward, a subsidiary of Hikma this week.

Specifically, our first quarter 2017 was another record quarter of Innvous Pharma as we reported $2.2 million in net revenues. This is approximately an 866% increase over the prior first quarter 2016 net revenues which totaled $225,000. First quarter 2017 revenues also represented close to 30% increase from the fourth quarter of 2016, which totaled $1.7 million in revenues.
I believe it is important to note that our net cash use and operations for this quarter was a little under $500,000 a very sign that we are inching closer to being cash flow positive again and targeting -- targeted profitability exiting 2017.
In addition, our Beyond Human sales and Marketing Platform keeps producing outstanding performances, which resulted in having now several products generating the majority of our revenues from our six core products, which include Vesele, Sensum+, UriVarx, Zestra, RecalMax and BHT products.
We have also announced a new product in May 2017 called ProstaGorx to effectively maintain good prostate health.
The product targets is very large an unmet medical need markets. And with all the new products launched and expected to launch this year, the new commercial deals outside the United States, we are currently have signed a new ones we expect to announce in the near future. We believe we have put forward very achievable and reasonable expectation for 2017 and we continue to work towards profitability, the largest milestones in the history of the company.
It is just impressive to see how the company has grown from $225,000 in revenue in first quarter 2016 to $2.2 million in first quarter 2017.
At this time, I would like to discuss our sales channels in the United States to have a better understanding of our business model and growth. So, we currently sell products through four main channels, first, our wholesalers and retailers which include several thousand stores in United States, two, through our on over 120 Web sites at this time, through our beyond human and sales marketing platforms which reaches between 20 million to 30 million people on a monthly basis and four, through our 14 international distributors.
And I think important to know that we are working on implementing additional sales channels and we will be updating our investors on our new channel and your channels as we launch them.
And I also think it is important for our shareholders and the market to know that our success in growing the business stems from the following items. First, we have a very unique business model, and our unique business model is based on our ability and success in licensing and/or acquiring additional over the counter monograph and FDA approved OTC and NDAs that will permit us to gain a strong foothold in the Rx to OTC switch market of the following disease markets.
First, sexual dysfunction, second, migraine and brain health, three, prostate diseases, bladder diseases and respiratory diseases.
We also which make us very unique here have an complement those products with clinically tested and validated supplements and consumer care products for the same disease target, a very unique business model that have allowed us to gain the trust and the loyalty of consumers, hence we see the results with the continuously increasing sales revenues.
Second, our ability to register our products outside the United States and find good international commercial partners and actually start generate revenues from those markets. For a very small company like Innovus is a testament to the experienced, proven track records of the management and the uniqueness and proven business model we have.
Third, our ability to bring in or develop new targets continuously and the main targets are few areas we target. And fourth, our ability to continue to optimize our current sales platforms. And I think the results we announced today with our gross margin continuously increasing is really the proof that the optimization and the strategy we are undertaking is working very well as expected.

And the continuous optimization of our sales platforms and the addition of new sales platforms and revenues will continuously improve our margins and our profits.
Now, I would like to discuss three specific topics that I'm sure the shareholders are waiting to hear from us. First, FlutiCare. So, as you know we have been waiting on the approval of the ANDA of the OTC ANDA with our current partner which has taken longer than anticipated and since we cannot control the review process by the agency, we have moved forward with signing the supply agreement with another company called West-Ward, which is a subsidiary Hikma Pharmaceuticals, which already have and have recently got the approval of their OTC ANDA for Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray.
For Innovus to be able to launch now FlutiCare under the recently approved ANDA and as by the first quarter of this year. Again, we expect now to launch FlutiCare and the fourth quarter of this year under the approved ANDA. And under the agreement, with West-Ward, the agreement calls for the Innovus to commit annual minimum purchase requirements for the duration of the agreement and we will not have to pay West-Ward anything else for this relationship.
We will be launching the 120 spray version of the drug in generic states which is currently the only commercially viable dose and once launched by Innovus, FlutiCare will be the third national brand in the U.S. after GSKs Flonase and Bayer's ClariSpray.
And I think, it is important to note here that West-Ward awarded only to [Terigo] [ph], which is a very large pharma, the rights to supply what is called the store brands only and shows Innovus for the national brands. I mean, this is a testament to the confidence in our commercial abilities and our recognized FlutiCare brand to compete with GSK and Bayer and this very large over $1 billion market in the U.S.
This is a big accomplishment for the company to be in the same space as last pharma with a drug targeting over $1 billion market. So, we expect to reach gross revenues from the sale of FlutiCare within 12-month of launching the drug of approximately $10 million to $15 million to supply.
Now, that our drug launch is in the very close horizon, we are tirelessly working on preparing our physician sampling and working with our retailers and all of our online print media sales channels to be ready for the launch in the fourth quarter of this year.
I will now give you some additional details on the projected launch process of the channels. So, first, we intent to do a sampling to the top 20 subscribers of the fluticasone propionate in the United States as we are working to finalize agreements with our over 20,000 retail stores with which we are already vendor of record. And to launch FlutiCare under our Beyond Human sales and Marketing Platform reaching 20 million to 30 million people on a monthly basis along or in conjunction with the other product that we have in the same space like our AllerVarx tablets for allergy symptom management.
And fourth, we plan to launch FlutiCare online through our robust online platforms including our Web sites and including over 2 million subscribers that we currently have and through Amazon.
And I think this summarizes right now, the timing of the launch, the processes we are taking to prepare the launch and we have continued to update you on the progress of the launch and once the launch is done.
Now, I would like to talk more about Vesele which is still our leading product in terms of sales and I'm very happy to announce that the first set of results of the combination of our supplement Vesele was sildenafil sold as Viagra in the U.S. by Pfizer Rn. The company is finalizing the statistical analysis of the data and we hope to be able to announce that data very soon.

The sexual dysfunction is a very large market and Vesele is the only product to our knowledge that has been studied in a human and showed significant effects on penile harness and maintenance and those are very complemented end points to the PD-5 inhibitors on the market. So, once all the studies are completed, we see Vesele as the major supplement along with the PD-5 inhibitors especially if the FDA approves the Rx to the OTC switch ANDA of the Cialis [low form] [ph] that was filed by Sanofi, who is Lilly's partner in the United States.
And just to remind the investors that the patents for Cialis expires in 2018 in the United States. So, having a blockbuster drug patent expire will allow now the generic to hit the market. And having, Sanofi do all the leg work to be able to switch the drug from Rx to the OTC for the lower dose will give us a great opportunity now once this happens to be able to push Vesele alongside with at least Cialis generics if approved as OTC.
Since we believe that Vesele has a great potential not just in the U.S., we are anticipating and working very hard for finding for approval with additional country to expand our territories and revenues from this product and we will keep the market appraise on the progress of filing in different countries.
Third, I want to talk our Beyond Human sales and marketing platform, which as I mentioned before reaches between 20 million to 30 million in the U.S. on a monthly basis. I mean this platform since we acquired this in March last year has been performing consistently performing with great returns to Innvous. And I'm pleased to announce that we are in the process of expanding the sales of marketing platform to Canada as the first country, the Canadian market is expected to be between 10% to 20% of the U.S. market and successful in our introduction to Canada, we should expect to add between 0.5 million to 1 million in additional revenues in the first 12 months of launch from products like Vesele and grow from there.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rauly, our VP of Finance to discuss with you our detailed financial results. Rauly?
Rauly Gutierrez
Thank you, Bassam.
As Bassam mentioned we recorded revenues in the first quarter of 2017 totaling $2.2 million, products contributing to our revenues included Vesele, UriVarx, Sensum+, BHT Zestra and RecalMax. This represented 866% increase over the previous year's first quarter and on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis a 29% increase.
Equally impressive our gross margins for the first quarter were approximately 80%, which is significantly higher than our first quarter of 2016 gross margins of approximately 47%. We believe this highlights the strength of our Beyond Human platform and the efficiencies we have been able to create by adding our existing products such as Vesele, Zestra, RecalMax, UriVarx and Sensum+ on to this platform.
We will continue to look for ways to optimize our gross margins in the following quarters. Our net used -- our net cash used in operations was $496,000 for the quarter compared to $1 million for the previous fourth quarter of 2016. We believe this represents great progress as we move towards our goal of becoming cash flow positive by exiting 2017.
Sales and marketing expense increased to $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. This was primarily driven by the increase in the number of print and online media advertisements of our existing products through the Beyond Human platform. The increase is also attributable to increased cost in sales and marketing support services due to the high volume of our sales orders.
On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues as decreased by over 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and by over 27% when compared to the third quarter of 2016. We expect this to continue to moderate as a percentage of sales going forward as we see customers utilizing more and more of the subscription model to purchase our products and we continue to conduct more targeted print and online media advertisements.

General and administrative expenses increased to $1.7 million in the first quarter, this amount did however include non-cash stock-based compensation to $600,000 as well as non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $200,000.
First quarter, general and administrative expenses represented almost 10% decrease from the fourth quarter 2016 and an approximate 32% decrease as a percentage of revenues when compared to the same for the fourth quarter of 2016.
Most importantly, loss from operations for the first quarter of 2017 was $1.7 million which I said before includes $800,000 of non-cash stock-based compensation and amortization. This represents a decrease of $300,000 from the fourth quarter of 2016 and $600,000 from the third quarter of 2016. A loss from operations as a percentage of revenues has decreased by 38% from the fourth quarter of 2016 and 43% from the third quarter of 2016.
So as we continue to look at different ways to control operating costs and conduct more targeted print and online media advertisements. We believe this trend of decrease in our loss from operations continues to demonstrate our progress to reach our goal of profitability.
At March 31, 2017, our cash balance has grew to $2.4 million as compared to $800,000 at December 31, 2016. The increase from the cash balance is due to the $3.3 million we received in net cash proceeds from the registered public offering which we completed in March 2017.
With the proceeds from the public offering, we have been able to strengthen our balance sheet by paying in full the remaining 2016 convertible debentures of $1.3 million eliminating the associated embedded conversion future derivative liability of $200,000, an increase in our stock flows equity to over $3 million.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bassam.
Bassam Damaj
Thank you, Rauly.
The pieces are falling in place towards achieving our current main goals for 2017. First, the first goal I'd like to talk about is the successful launch of FlutiCare. The FlutiCare is the major product for the company and executing a successful launch is a must for us to ensure meeting the projected revenues from this product between to $10 million to $15 million alone and gaining a significant market share of the over-the-counter -- over $1 billion market that we are targeting.
Second, expanding the number of international distributors for our core products, an increase in revenues from the sale, this is important why because ex-U.S. sales through our partners do not have any sale on or marketing cost for us and the revenues hit our bottom-line, which will allow us to hit profitability factor.
Third, continue to license and/or acquire additional companies, technologies or products and the OTC, and the OTC ANDA spaces in the therapeutic areas that we are targeting. Fourth and most important is to reach profitability exiting 2017. I believe the revenue growth we have been experiencing along with the additional product launches expected this year, the commercial partnerships and increase in revenues that we expect from the current products and from the FlutiCare's projected launch in the fourth quarter, we will pave the way to achieve our goal.
Our year-to-year growth is closed to eight-fold and we are achieving gross margin of about 80%. As a result, we are currently confident with our ability to achieve profitability exiting 2017. And I believe you heard from Rauly that most of our losses are non-cash based losses. And I think this is very important to note and the more we are able to decrease our use of net cash, the factor we get to profitability.
I mean we have accomplished a lot in the first quarter of 2017, and then, subsequent time period prior to this earnings call. And as a summary to some of the important highlights of this period include one, we closed $3.8 million in equity financing with the additional potential of $3.85 million in short-term orders and another $3.85 million in long-terms orders.

And I think this is important for us why because for a company on the Bulletin Board and in our space, it is not easy to do equity financing. As you have seen, it's mainly related to note and convertible note. So, doing this equity financing actually really makes a big difference to us and also I think it is important for us that we have paid back the left over of the convertible notes and we do not have anymore convertible notes on our books.
Second, we increased our OTC drug supplements and consumer care products to 18. Third, we were able to secure an approved OTC, ANDA for FlutiCare to launch in the United States and will enable us. Once we launch it as Innovus for FlutiCare to be one of only three national brands in the United States with currently anticipated revenues into $10 million to $15 million range on a calendar basis from the launches.
We continue our corporate and business development efforts to increase the number of OTC, ANDA drugs. OTC drugs and clinically validated supplement and consumer care products and to license and develop our own proprietary products, you saw we just launched another product in a very large area -- as area with ProstaGorx and we look forward to continuously updating you on the expected launches that we have upcoming as we previously disclosed.
And we continue to grow our international sales of our products through key marketing approvals of Zestra and Sensum, which we announced not long time ago in 28 countries of the European Union and we are working on increasing the number of approvals in the next few quarters.
And finally, which is most important for us is that we continue the road to becoming profitable exiting 2017.
In conclusion, first, I'd like to thank our shareholders who have invested with us and have been -- loyal to us and have believed in our successful business model allowing us to be one of the main companies in the OTC switch space supplement and consumer care business.
As we have shown in the acquisition of the rise of the ANDA, OTC for FlutiCare, although we are a small to public company, but we have an experienced management team who remains committed to working for the company and the shareholders to increase the revenues and profitability of the company and to develop market and sell products that can have an immediate beneficial impact on our patients life.
And with this, I'd like to thank you for listening to our call. We will now open the floor for questions from the audience.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Jay Albany from SeeThruEquity. Please go ahead with your question.
Jay Albany
Hi guys, congratulations on the growth -- execution this quarter. I had a quick question in terms of achieving positive margins and revenue, what kind of revenue levels are you targeting to achieve adjusted profitability on a quarterly basis.
Bassam Damaj
So, we have not actually given projections on a reported basis, but we have -- actually have discussed between 10 million to 15 million should put us in the profitability we are targeting.
Jay Albany
Okay, great.
Bassam Damaj
And with the new -- again with the new products we're launching, with the expected ones we are launching and as I mentioned with the new additional partnership we expect to announce, we have really pushing to be profitable ahead of those numbers hopefully. So, but what really guide us was to be able to exit profitable anyway between $10 million to $15 million revenues.
Jay Albany
That's great. I had a good question, your margins -- your gross margins have really expanded lately, is that mostly from the new sales platform, is there anything you can say to expand on how that's been -- you have been achieving that and what we should think about.

Bassam Damaj
Yes. I mean, the increase in the margin -- actually its two main things. First of all, we are now much more -- now that we have under our belt about a year experience in the sales and all the platform we have, we now are able to do more targeted campaigns as Rauly discussed in there. And those targeted campaigns actually have really yielded much more results to us and that actually help push the margins up quite a bit.
We also actually have some ex-U.S. sales, which also doesn't have any sales and marketing cost to us, which also helps from the bottom-line. But definitely it's a combination of things, but primarily it's actually our ability to optimize our sales and marketing platform by having a much more targeted campaigns and targeted areas for us that allows us actually to get much better return on the investments.
Jay Albany
Thank you. Just one more, if I could, then I will [bid farewell] [ph], what else, in terms of FlutiCare that's exciting news, could you expand on sort of the timing and expectations you have to get to $10 million to $15 million from the first year commercial operations.
Bassam Damaj
Sure. I mean, we announced the signing of the partnership just this Tuesday. As you know, as we mentioned before, I mean it takes few months, we can get the first batch of the drug we have also in the meantime some fighting on the label and the box and so forth we have to. So, we expect the launch to be in the fourth quarter of this year.
From the time of the launch, we expect between $10 million to $15 million in revenues from FlutiCare, and then from there, the revenues should go up as we have much more market penetration in the U.S.
Jay Albany
Great. Thanks so much. Congratulations.
Bassam Damaj
Thank you, Jay.
Operator
Our next question comes from James Painter from Springboard Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
James Painter
Bassam, congratulations on the quarter, I've actually got four questions here. First one is terms of your convertible debt last year, are you able to take care of all of that or is there still any lingering out there?
Bassam Damaj
Well, as I've mentioned actually the company does not have any convertible debt at all. We paid all the remaining convertible debt with the rates we did. So, I can actually tell you there is zero remaining and the convertible debt on the book. So we've cleaned the books quite a bit.
James Painter
Okay. That's encouraging. In terms of the shareholder equity, I know there is a $5 million requirement for the NASDAQ, have you closed on that, can you talk a little bit about that as well?
Bassam Damaj
So, we are actually a little bit over $3 million in positive shareholder equity at this time. As you know NASDAQ requires $5 million shareholders equity. So, we are inching little by little towards positive shareholder equity, but we're not there yet.
James Painter
Okay, great. Thank you. And my final question is going to be in terms of Innovus as a potential acquisition, do you -- you see any national brands that were potentially be acquisitive towards Innovus talk about that a little bit brief?
Bassam Damaj
Yes. I mean, listen, we're continuously looking at national brands that are complementary to our brands, right? So, I cannot discuss in specific details which ones we're looking at. We're reevaluating, but I consider that we evaluate a lot of opportunities on a monthly basis and we are actually continuously looking to bring in national brands to our pipeline. I think it is an important question because as you know natural brands are what makes a difference for a company and what establishes a company as a market leader in some therapeutic areas. So, this is for us an important part on a business development side to be able to bring in national brands.

James Painter
Fantastic, that's enough out of me. Thank you very much for your time.
Bassam Damaj
Thank you, Jim.
Operator
Our next question comes from Prashant Mehta from PM Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.
Prashant Mehta
Yes, Bassam. Bassam and the team congratulations guys. Quickly, it's very clear that Bassam you are excited about the FlutiCare. I've heard a lot of good stuff, I heard dates, can you clarify the third quarter, fourth quarter launch and what's maybe this might be a repeat, but I do want some clarification on what behind the scenes between now and the launch to prepare you for the launch, that's my first question.
And the second question is regarding your ANDA filing, can you give us some update on the progress outside the U.S. please? Thank you.
Bassam Damaj
Sure. For the first question, I mean, we do not expect to have the product available until the fourth quarter of this year. So, our really projected launch is the fourth quarter of this year. What we're doing behind the scenes? What we have been doing and what we continuously do in there? I mean, I think it is important that when we acquired -- we acquired them for multiple reasons, not just for the FlutiCare as a national brand, not just because there was already a over-the-counter OTC, ANDA filed by our partners, but also because they were vendor of record with over 20,000 stores in the United States. I think this is important because we do want to start from scratch and go on and build those relationships. We had already as a vendor of records.
So now what the team is really working on that we have secured the ANDA to be able to launch this product is really working very hard and aggressively to really finalize the agreement with those stores. And finalize the format for how the product should be shipped and the SKUs and so forth in order to be able to place it as soon as we received the product from West-Ward and our distribution centers.
This is one, the second, which is important and I think the market I talked about that in my previous calls. I mean, the market for Fluticasone Propionate sprayed once it switch from Rx to OTC is no longer a market where the patient takes out of scripts and go give it to the pharmacist whatever the pharmacist gives him as a genetic takes at home. This is the market that has evolved to where now patients are buying up to six units at the same time. Patients are looking to subscribe to a model where they get the product shipped to them on a monthly basis where the product is more cheaply and most efficient to them. The market where those patients don't just use Fluticasone on in it's own. They use eye drops with it. They use nasal dosage, nasal sprays in order to clear the softness then they use the Fluticasone.
So there is a whole -- a new market that opens and this is where we come in. We have now product like AllerVarx we've licensed like the nasal dose and supplement we're looking to introduce where we're able now to set FlutiCare and offer with it those additional products. So, now the customer can come in and say, what now I'll take FlutiCare, it is a very good price position, price point for me, I'll buy two to five units at the same time. I'll take with it AllerVarx, I will take with it nasal spray from one all the while I'm sitting home and then they can ship on a monthly basis what I need.
And I think where we are unique in this model is that you have to remember that if you go to ClariSpray from Bayer, you go to buy Flonase -- these are available in the retail stores only. So retail stores and some resellers online, don't offer the monthly auto ship option that we actually offer to our customers.
So, we have this advantage over that. And we have the other advantages that we already have a loyal base that is out there. We have 2 million subscribers to our Web site. We continuously reach 20 million to 30 million actually potential buyers of FlutiCare on a monthly basis from our Human sales and Marketing Platform. We are working on building and adding additional sales channels for us. We also have those retail stores that we're going to put the product on, but I think also more importantly is that we are preparing to do a sampling to the top 20 physician prescribers of the Fluticasone Propionate.

As you know, a lot of those big pharma that when a product is now genetic disease that is little to know sampling that is done to this. Now you go to the doctor, he won't give you a free Flonase or a free ClariSpray sample because there is none, they don't do it anymore. He says you go and buy it from the stores whereas us being able now to do the steps to putting FlutiCare in there, here are some free samples give it to your patients. The patient now looks at this in a different way. So we will be doing this as we do all the different steps that we are working on to really achieve a successful launch of the product.
Now coming for the second question on the current ANDA that was filed by our partner, I mean, listen, we publicly said we don't control the process in the U.S. So, what we have done, we were able to find another partner to be able to launch it and we've done that. At the same time, we are still actually working towards getting and prepare to get additional guidance for FlutiCare outside the U.S.
As I mentioned before we started this process in Europe by going through the U.K. The U.K. decided to have their Brexit. So, now it's no longer approved as part of the EU guidance. So, we have to go and look what is currently -- what is the best country for us to go and ask for guidance to file for it. In addition, we are actually looking for guidance in Canada. We are looking for guidance in the Middle East, North Africa and additional countries.
I don't know if you know, but this actually does take time and usually when you start actually those -- when you start those guidance, I think this is important to note that in order to launch or file for a product in countries like Middle East, North Africa because what is required is the CPP, the Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product in the country of origin which means we have to sell the product first.
In the U.S. to be able to issue that CPP for the potential partners we have, we will get out there. So for us, although, we're working towards preparing for the guidance, we will actually need to do it under the fourth quarter until we really been able to really start that process seriously and do the finding. So I hope that answers the question.
Prashant Mehta
That's good. Thank you so much Bassam. Good luck.
Bassam Damaj
Thank you.
Operator
And ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from [Robert Scott] [ph]. Please go ahead with your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Hello, Bassam. We've been talking about Europe a lot, switching over to South Korea, what part of that $2 million deals have you received or you've seen any of it yet or when it's coming?
Bassam Damaj
Sure. So we signed the deal with [GNH] [ph] and Korea and the agreement with them calls for a minimum of $2 million a year in order to keep the exclusive license. As you know for South Korea, we had the -- our partner had to receive the approval actually to market the produce there and I think we are now the approval for Korea only in March and for that to be able to import the product.
And I have to say, I mean, we actually do have orders from our partner in Korea already and this is very fact from being able to get approval in March, and then be able to ship. But as we mentioned before, we already actually shipped the first order we received for this around three pack to that we recognized $60,000 of that and we do have another active purchase order from our partner for the multi-dose and we are working to work fulfilling that purchase order and we continue to work with our partner to get additional orders to fulfill. And but our partners seems to be very confident on their ability actually to do the 2 million and from [indiscernible] South Korea and that's actually something we are keen for us to happen.

Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. And one last quick question, how many products now do you have on the market and do you plan to introduce any more new ones?
Bassam Damaj
So currently we have 18 products on the market in the United States and we are working on introducing for 2017, another six to eight new products. Our target really -- we want to be over 25 products in U.S. And again, I think it's important to note here so the goal is not really to introduce a lot of product. The goal is to introduce products that we believe will be product for us -- blockbuster products. These are the type of products that we've look to introduce in markets where there is unmet medical needs, unmet need in there and products that are very complementary in the same therapeutic areas for the actual drugs that we have or bringing into market that.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. I appreciate that. It looks great.
Bassam Damaj
Thank you.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Dr. Damaj for any closing remarks.
Bassam Damaj
Thank you. In closing, I'd like to thank everybody for joining the call today and for all the questions. I'd like to thank you, thank our shareholders for their loyalty and for their belief in the company's business model and the company and we look forward to continuing to update you on our roadmap to profitability exiting 2017.

Dr. Bassam Damaj of Innovus Pharma: Rapid Growth Plan Succeeds


Press Release
-

												Oct 11, 2016						
 


			October 11, 2016			(Press Release) -
	SAN DIEGO CA -  Innovus Pharma (OTCQB: INNV) is one of those very rare microcap companies with real products, real revenues, and a proven record of rapid growth, according to a new updated analysis by CEOCFO magazine. CEOCFO states that the San Diego-based consumer and pharmaceutical company pulled in more than $1 million product sales in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of over 400% compared to the first quarter of 2016. It's on track for more than $5 million in revenues for all of 2016 -- and $15 million in 2017, which would put Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: INNV) firmly in the black. Most important, the Company has acquired the worldwide rights to FlutiCare™, a nasal spray for allergy symptoms that Innovus will market over-the-counter (OTC).  "We believe there is incredible potential here," the Biotech Stock Review writes. Once FlutiCare™ "can be bought without a prescription, the overall market could expand to 77 million units (per year) or over $1 billion in sales." "People have been surprised at the significant revenue growth," says CEO Dr. Bassam Damaj. "And with key mainstream drugs like FlutiCare™, the real growth is just starting," Damaj adds. "Our goal is to up-list to the NASDAQ exchange at the right time and grow to be a significant revenue-generating Company with earnings." The secret of Innovus' success is conceptually simple: Acquire products that bring real benefits to patients and that already have strong revenues or have revenue potential, and sell them under the proprietary Beyond Human sales and marketing platform.  But that's easier said than done. It takes an experienced biotech and pharma chief executive like the Lebanese-born Damaj, 47, who trained at and has helped bring drugs to market at such major companies as Pfizer, Genentech, Pharmacopeia, Tanabe Seiyaku (now Mitsubishi-Tanabe) and Apricus Biosciences. "This is what I do best," he explains. "I'm very well known in the field, so I know what's out there, what will succeed in the marketplace, and what will make a difference in the lives of people." It also helped that Damaj brought $2.5 million of his own money to the Company when he joined the Company in 2013, and has been able to raise $5 million more this year on the strength of his reputation for spotting the growth potential in products when others don't. The money has enabled Innovus to acquire several moneymaking products in a broad range of areas, such as sexual health, vitality, vision, urology, and allergy relief. All are backed up by patent protection or proprietary formulations, and supported by clinical data; more are on the way.  One of the most successful purchases for Innovus was acquiring supplement company Beyond Human and its powerful marketing and sales platform. Beyond Human's lead product, BTH® Testosterone Booster, is a dietary supplement containing vitamins, zinc, and extracts of the herbs fenugreek and Eurycoma longifolia, which have been linked to increased testosterone levels and enhanced sexual function. That product had sales of $2.2 million in 2015 and is bringing significant revenues for Innovus, says Damaj. Another top seller is Vesele®, a supplement that enhances blood flow and promotes both sexual health, as shown in a clinical use survey trial, Damaj says. Innovus acquired the product for $40,000 in 2015 and now it is the best-selling product for Company. Strong clinical trials and patents also support Zestra®, a blend of oils that boosts female arousal, which Innovus acquired from Semprae Laboratories, Inc. In addition, Innovus's product lineup includes EjectDelay® for premature ejaculation, Androferti® (in the US and Canada) for overall male reproductive health and sperm quality, and BTH Vision Formula. But both Damaj and investors are particularly excited by Innovus's 2015 merger with Novalere FP, which brought to Innovus the worldwide rights to the FlutiCare™ brand.  Fluticare™ (containing the active pharmaceutical product fluticasone propionate nasal spray) is a type of corticosteroid used to fight symptoms of allergies, such as stuffy and runny noses, itching, and sneezing -- and is a key product in the $1 billion annual market for nasal steroids. FlutiCare™ now is a prescription generic version of the top-selling brand-name drug Flonase, but is expected to go OTC by the end of 2016. "FlutiCare™ will put us on the map as an important mainstream pharmaceutical company," says Damaj.  The final key element in Innovus' growth and success is that the Company doesn't just make shrewd acquisitions like FlutiCare™. It also hires the best people, like new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Robert Hoffman, who will spearhead the Company's growth and revenue generation.  "Our primary goal is to becoming a major pharmaceutical company," says Damaj. "I am very confident that we will realize this goal."

It also hires the best people, like new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Robert Hoffman, who will spearhead the Company's growth and revenue generation."Our primary goal is to becoming a major pharmaceutical company," says Damaj. "I am very confident that we will realize this goal."Image Available: http://www2.marketwire.com/mw/frame_mw?attachid=3065681ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFJ Company's FJ40 is the Toyota Land Cruiser you really wantAutoblogZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredShkreli portrayed both as liar, well-meaning as trial nears endReutersJeff Bezos’ brief stint as world’s richest human ends with Amazon’s second-quarter whiffTechCrunchBristol-Myers (BMY) Q2 Earnings Beats EstimatesZacksEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredWednesday Apple Rumors: iPhone 8 Enters Trial ProductionInvestorPlaceTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderAfter Losing 218lbs Rebel Wilson Drops JawsHealthSkilletSponsoredRepublicans warn Trump: No confirmation hearing for a Sessions replacement, and no recess appointment eitherBusiness InsiderVirgin Atlantic founder Sir Richard Branson sells 31pc stake in airline for £220m as part of new tie-up with Air France-KLMThe TelegraphTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredGDP — What you need to know in markets on FridayYahoo FinanceMattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted transgender ban, and he was reportedly 'appalled' by itBusiness InsiderRussia orders cut in US diplomats in reaction to sanctionsDirk: Gosh, I hope this doesn't lead Russia to deny America of all the Russian cars, Russian electronics, Russian textiles and all other Russian products that we consume.

Interview With The President And CEO: Apricus Biosciences, Inc. (APRI) - Bassam DamajHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Interview With The President And CEO: Apricus Biosciences, Inc. (APRI) - Bassam DamajWall Street TranscriptMay 1, 2012ReblogShareTweetShare67 WALL STREET, New York - May 1, 2012 - The Wall Street Transcript has just published its Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals Report offering a timely review of the sector to serious investors and industry executives. This special feature contains expert industry commentary through in-depth interviews with public company CEOs, Equity Analysts and Money Managers. The full issue is available by calling (212) 952-7433 or via The Wall Street Transcript Online.Topics covered: Biotech Stocks Outperformance and Rally - FDA Drug Approval Process - M&A Activity Acceleration in 2012 - U.S. Health Care RegulationCompanies include: BioLife Solutions (BLFS); Abbott (ABT); Achillion (ACHN); Affymax (AFFY); Alexion (ALXN); Amgen (AMGN); and many more.In the following brief excerpt from the Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals Report, expert analysts discuss the outlook for the sector and for investors.Dr. Bassam Damaj was appointed to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the board in December 2009, and was elected as Chairman of the board in October 2010. He is the Co-Founder and former Chief Scientific Officer of Bio-Quant, and served in that capacity since its inception in 1999. Before Bio-Quant, Dr. Damaj served as President and CEO of Biosignature Diagnostics, Inc. He also served as the Group Leader for the Office of New Target Intelligence and a Group Leader for immunological and inflammatory disease programs at Tanabe Research Laboratories U.S.A., Inc. Dr. Damaj holds a Ph.D. in immunology/microbiology, a postdoctoral fellowship in molecular oncology and an MBA in health care.TWST: Would we start with an overview and history of Apricus Biosciences?Dr. Damaj: Apricus Biosciences (APRI) is a public pharmaceutical company. We're listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol APRI. The company focuses on enhancing pharmaceutical products. Since its founding, the company has advanced many products through clinical development and also approval. We have in Canada, Vitaros for erectile dysfunction, a strong pipeline, and are close to receiving market authorization for Vitaros in Europe. In addition, we have three marketed products in the United States for oncology and oncology-supported care that we have acquired.TWST: Would you talk about the technology involved in your NexACT systems and its related pipeline?Dr. Damaj: At the core of Apricus is a drug-delivery technology called NexACT, which is a unique, patented small-molecule technology designed to allow drug delivery through what we call tight junctions that hold the cells together and allow the drug to go through the skin. And what NexACT technology allows is really for enhancing and allowing drugs that usually don't go through the skin or other routes, to go through the skin noninvasively and achieve higher levels in blood to achieve the efficacy needed from those drugs. And again, when you do that, you're able sometimes to use less of the drug, and if the drug has any side effects then you can have lower of those side effects. And the improvement that we really made possible with the NexACT technology - they hold the potential to provide compounds with what we call NCE-like differentiation, and NCE stands for new chemical entities, which have very strong patent protection.TWST: Would you tell us about the company's plans to market Vitaros, a male erectile dysfunction product, as well as the female sexual arousal product called Femprox? What partnerships and relationships are in place for those products?Dr. Damaj: Our strategy is really to develop and play an active role in the commercialization of our NexACT-enhanced formulations of proven and well-characterized drugs that usually address a large patient population. So to accomplish this the strategy is to work both independently through our own sales force for some of the products, as well as have partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies, such as our partners Abbott, Novartis, Sandoz, Warner Chilcott, as they share the same goals and have the right strategic sales force and marketing to push the drugs into the market.TWST: Where will this lead Apricus? With the experience gained on these products, what are the next likely suspects?Dr. Damaj: Our flagship product is a drug called Vitaros, which is approved in Canada. It's going to be launched the second half of this year with Abbott Laboratories, and it is currently the only topical treatment approved for erectile dysfunction in the world, and this product actually does not have the side effects that the oral PDE5, like Viagra, Cialis and Levitra have. It is the only product that we call an on-demand treatment, which the patients would add the product and within minutes the patients will have a response, and it's currently the only product that is safe and effective for the entire patient population that the oral PDE5 will not work for. I'm leading with this because this actually shows the strength of the technology and what we can do. Following on Vitaros' success, we have developed a very strong pipeline, is the second of which is Femprox for female sexual arousal disorder, which is a combination of our NexACT and Alprostadil.It's a topical gel, which we already completed a Phase III clinical trials successfully. We're following with MycoVa, which is a combination of Terbinafine and NexACT for onychomycosis, which is a fungus infection of the nail. We have PrevOnco, which is a combination of lansoprazole and NexACT for hepatocellular carcinoma for cancer. In addition, we have acquired a series of drugs in the oncology and oncology-supportive care space, like Granisol, currently the only marketed and approved granisetron product for vomiting and nausea associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.We have also Totect, which is the only drug actually approved for the treatment of extravasation of chemotherapy to help actually the survival of the patient and remove the excess of the chemotherapy that will destroy the tissues. So with this now, we have moved from a clinical-stage development company to what we call a commercial-stage company, and with a commercial-stage company, we do have our own revenues and pushing for more revenues.The Wall Street Transcript is a unique service for investors and industry researchers - providing fresh commentary and insight through verbatim interviews with CEOs and research analysts.
