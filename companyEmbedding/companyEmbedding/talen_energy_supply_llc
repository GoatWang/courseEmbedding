Talen Energy Supply, LLC Key Developments

Talen Energy Supply, LLC Announces Early Tender Results of Principal Amount of $900,000,000 of its 4.625% Senior Notes Due 2019, Its 6.500% Senior Notes Due 2018 and its 4.600% Senior Notes Due 2021
Apr 13 17
Talen Energy Supply, LLC announced the early tender results for its previously announced tender offers to purchase for cash up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $900,000,000 (the "Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount") of its 4.625% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes"), its 6.500% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes") and its 4.600% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes" and, together with the 2019 Notes and the 2018 Notes, the "Securities"). The Tender Offers were made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated March 30, 2017 (the "Offer to Purchase"). As of the previously announced early tender date and time of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 12, 2017 (the "Early Tender Date"), according to information provided by D.F. King & Co. Inc., the tender agent for the Tender Offers, a total of $1,093,092,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes, $330,695,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes and $309,765,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offers. Since the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn would exceed the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount, the Company will not accept for purchase any 2018 Notes or 2021 Notes that have been tendered. Rather, the Company will prorate the 2019 Notes accepted for purchase using a proration factor of approximately 82.4%. Withdrawal rights for the Securities expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 12, 2017. The table below sets forth the aggregate principal amount of the Securities that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by the Early Tender Date that will be accepted for purchase by the Company. The "Total Consideration" for the 2019 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers is the amount shown in the table above with respect to the 2019 Notes. Holders of the 2019 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date are eligible to receive the Total Consideration for any such 2019 Notes accepted for purchase. Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on the 2019 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the applicable last interest payment date up to, but not including, the date the Company makes payment for such 2019 Notes, which date is anticipated to be April 13, 2017. The Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 27, 2017, unless extended or earlier terminated. Because the Tender Offers have been fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, holders who tender Securities after the Early Tender Date will not have any of their Securities accepted for purchase. Any Securities tendered after the Early Tender Date, together with all Securities (other than the 2019 Notes) tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date, will be returned to the holders thereof as described in the Offer to Purchase.

Apr 7 17
Talen Energy Supply, LLC announced on April 6, 2017 that it has priced $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 9.500% senior unsecured guaranteed notes due 2022 in a private offering.

Talen Energy Supply intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with proceeds from term loan borrowings and cash on hand and/or revolver borrowings, to refinance, repurchase and/or repay certain of Talen Energy Supply's existing indebtedness, including in connection with the previously announced tender offers for Talen Energy Supply's 6.500% Senior Notes due 2018, 4.625% Senior Notes due 2019 and 4.600% Senior Notes due 2021, and to pay transaction fees and expenses.

ALLENTOWN, Pa., April 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Talen Energy Supply, LLC (the "Company" or "Talen Energy Supply") today announced the early tender results for its previously announced tender offers (the "Tender Offers") to purchase for cash up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $900,000,000 (the "Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount") of its 4.625% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes"), its 6.500% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes") and its 4.600% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes" and, together with the 2019 Notes and the 2018 Notes, the "Securities"). The Tender Offers were made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated March 30, 2017 (the "Offer to Purchase"). 








As of the previously announced early tender date and time of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 12, 2017 (the "Early Tender Date"), according to information provided by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the tender agent for the Tender Offers, a total of $1,093,092,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes, $330,695,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes and $309,765,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offers. Since the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn would exceed the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount, the Company will not accept for purchase any 2018 Notes or 2021 Notes that have been tendered. Rather, the Company will prorate the 2019 Notes accepted for purchase using a proration factor of approximately 82.4%. Withdrawal rights for the Securities expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 12, 2017. The table below sets forth the aggregate principal amount of the Securities that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by the Early Tender Date that will be accepted for purchase by the Company.

 (1)   Per $1,000 principal amount of Securities validly tendered and accepted for purchase 


 (2)   Includes Early Tender Payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of Securities. 


 (3)   Securities from such series will not be accepted for purchase by the Company. 




The "Total Consideration" for the 2019 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers is the amount shown in the table above with respect to the 2019 Notes. Holders of the 2019 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date are eligible to receive the Total Consideration for any such 2019 Notes accepted for purchase. Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on the 2019 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the applicable last interest payment date up to, but not including, the date the Company makes payment for such 2019 Notes, which date is anticipated to be April 13, 2017. 
The Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 27, 2017, unless extended or earlier terminated. Because the Tender Offers have been fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, holders who tender Securities after the Early Tender Date will not have any of their Securities accepted for purchase. Any Securities tendered after the Early Tender Date, together with all Securities (other than the 2019 Notes) tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date, will be returned to the holders thereof as described in the Offer to Purchase.

Morgan Stanley & Co LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC are the Joint Lead Dealer Managers for the Tender Offers and the Co-Dealer Managers are BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co, MUFG Securities Americas Inc., RBC Capital Markets, Riverstone Capital Services and UBS Securities LLC.

Investors are cautioned that any such statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Any such forward-looking statements should be considered in light of such important factors and in conjunction with other documents of Talen Energy on file with the SEC.  New factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for Talen Energy to predict all such factors, or the extent to which any such factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and Talen Energy undertakes no obligation to update the information contained in such statement to reflect subsequent developments or information.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.
To learn more visit our blog.



Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

Talen Energy is an independent power producer founded in 2015. It was formed when the competitive power generation business of PPL Corporation was spun off and immediately combined with competitive generation businesses owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings. Following these transactions, PPL shareholders owned 65% of Talen's common stock and affiliates of Riverstone owned 35%.[2] As a condition for FERC approval Talen agreed to divest approximately 1,300 megawatts of generating assets in the PJM Interconnection Region to mitigate FERC's competitiveness concerns.[2] On December 6, 2016, Riverstone Holdings completed the purchase of the remaining 65% of Talen's common stock, making it a privately owned company.[3]

History[edit]
According to the Director of Corporate Communications the name "Talen Energy" symbolizes talent of the people who work for the company and energy in terms of the product it produces and what employees bring to their jobs. Talen "represents the idea of talented people energized to succeed."[4] The company's colors were chosen based on the CEO Paul Farr's love of the Green Bay Packers.[5]
On June 10, 2014, PPL announced that it would spin off its competitive energy business which would merge with Riverstone Holdings' operations to create Talen.[6] The transaction needed approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the FERC, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission before its completion.[7]
On February 2, 2015, PPL and Riverstone accepted the FERC's mitigation option in order to receive approval from FERC.[7] The Pennsylvania PUC approval followed on March 11, 2015 when the PUC approved the transfer of PPL Electric Utilities' ownership in PPL Interstate Energy Company to Talen.[8] The NRC's approval for the transfer of the Susquehanna Nuclear Plant licenses came on April 10, 2015 and on April 23, 2015, PPL received the final regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice.[9][10]
Talen Energy launched on June 1, 2015. PPL shareholders initially owned 65 percent and Riverstone owned 35% of the shares of the new company, whose shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol TLN.[11]
On June 2, 2015, Paul Farr, President and CEO of Talen, and other executives rang the opening bell on the NYSE in celebration of the Talen Energy launch.[12]
On October 8, 2015, Talen announced the sale of Ironwood Natural Gas plant to a TransCanada subsidiary for 654 million USD, and Holtwood and Wallenpaupack Hydro plants to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners of Hamilton, Bermuda for 860 million USD.[13]
Facilities and infrastructure[edit]
Talen owns 15,320 megawatts of power generating capacity, and employs over 500 people in its headquarters in Allentown, as well as 3,000 others at plant locations in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Montana. It is the fourth-largest publicly traded independent power producer in the country.[14]




Susquehanna steam electric station


Talen's generation facilities include nuclear, coal fired and natural gas power plants. The largest plant is the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a 2,700 MWe nuclear power plant, located on the Susquehanna River seven miles (11 km) northeast of Berwick, Pennsylvania.[15]
The following is a list of Talen's current generation facilities owned by subsidiaries of Talen:

Following these transactions, PPL shareholders owned 65% of Talen's common stock and affiliates of Riverstone owned 35%.[2] As a condition for FERC approval Talen agreed to divest approximately 1,300 megawatts of generating assets in the PJM Interconnection Region to mitigate FERC's competitiveness concerns.[2] On December 6, 2016, Riverstone Holdings completed the purchase of the remaining 65% of Talen's common stock, making it a privately owned company.[3]

History[edit]
According to the Director of Corporate Communications the name "Talen Energy" symbolizes talent of the people who work for the company and energy in terms of the product it produces and what employees bring to their jobs. Talen "represents the idea of talented people energized to succeed."[4] The company's colors were chosen based on the CEO Paul Farr's love of the Green Bay Packers.[5]
On June 10, 2014, PPL announced that it would spin off its competitive energy business which would merge with Riverstone Holdings' operations to create Talen.[6] The transaction needed approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the FERC, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission before its completion.[7]
On February 2, 2015, PPL and Riverstone accepted the FERC's mitigation option in order to receive approval from FERC.[7] The Pennsylvania PUC approval followed on March 11, 2015 when the PUC approved the transfer of PPL Electric Utilities' ownership in PPL Interstate Energy Company to Talen.[8] The NRC's approval for the transfer of the Susquehanna Nuclear Plant licenses came on April 10, 2015 and on April 23, 2015, PPL received the final regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice.[9][10]
Talen Energy launched on June 1, 2015. PPL shareholders initially owned 65 percent and Riverstone owned 35% of the shares of the new company, whose shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol TLN.[11]
On June 2, 2015, Paul Farr, President and CEO of Talen, and other executives rang the opening bell on the NYSE in celebration of the Talen Energy launch.[12]
On October 8, 2015, Talen announced the sale of Ironwood Natural Gas plant to a TransCanada subsidiary for 654 million USD, and Holtwood and Wallenpaupack Hydro plants to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners of Hamilton, Bermuda for 860 million USD.[13]
Facilities and infrastructure[edit]
Talen owns 15,320 megawatts of power generating capacity, and employs over 500 people in its headquarters in Allentown, as well as 3,000 others at plant locations in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Montana. It is the fourth-largest publicly traded independent power producer in the country.[14]

Talen Energy is an independent power producer founded in 2015. It was formed when the competitive power generation business of PPL Corporation was spun off and immediately combined with competitive generation businesses owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings. Following these transactions, PPL shareholders owned 65% of Talen's common stock and affiliates of Riverstone owned 35%.[2] As a condition for FERC approval Talen agreed to divest approximately 1,300 megawatts of generating assets in the PJM Interconnection Region to mitigate FERC's competitiveness concerns.[2] On December 6, 2016, Riverstone Holdings completed the purchase of the remaining 65% of Talen's common stock, making it a privately owned company.[3]

History[edit]
According to the Director of Corporate Communications the name "Talen Energy" symbolizes talent of the people who work for the company and energy in terms of the product it produces and what employees bring to their jobs. Talen "represents the idea of talented people energized to succeed."[4] The company's colors were chosen based on the CEO Paul Farr's love of the Green Bay Packers.[5]
On June 10, 2014, PPL announced that it would spin off its competitive energy business which would merge with Riverstone Holdings' operations to create Talen.[6] The transaction needed approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the FERC, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission before its completion.[7]
On February 2, 2015, PPL and Riverstone accepted the FERC's mitigation option in order to receive approval from FERC.[7] The Pennsylvania PUC approval followed on March 11, 2015 when the PUC approved the transfer of PPL Electric Utilities' ownership in PPL Interstate Energy Company to Talen.[8] The NRC's approval for the transfer of the Susquehanna Nuclear Plant licenses came on April 10, 2015 and on April 23, 2015, PPL received the final regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice.[9][10]
Talen Energy launched on June 1, 2015. PPL shareholders initially owned 65 percent and Riverstone owned 35% of the shares of the new company, whose shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol TLN.[11]
On June 2, 2015, Paul Farr, President and CEO of Talen, and other executives rang the opening bell on the NYSE in celebration of the Talen Energy launch.[12]
On October 8, 2015, Talen announced the sale of Ironwood Natural Gas plant to a TransCanada subsidiary for 654 million USD, and Holtwood and Wallenpaupack Hydro plants to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners of Hamilton, Bermuda for 860 million USD.[13]
Facilities and infrastructure[edit]
Talen owns 15,320 megawatts of power generating capacity, and employs over 500 people in its headquarters in Allentown, as well as 3,000 others at plant locations in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Montana. It is the fourth-largest publicly traded independent power producer in the country.[14]




Susquehanna steam electric station


Talen's generation facilities include nuclear, coal fired and natural gas power plants. The largest plant is the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a 2,700 MWe nuclear power plant, located on the Susquehanna River seven miles (11 km) northeast of Berwick, Pennsylvania.[15]
The following is a list of Talen's current generation facilities owned by subsidiaries of Talen:
