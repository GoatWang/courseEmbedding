What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

				IntroducingGlobal Portfolio Strategies. More





				We don’t think like typicalfinancial advisers. More






Before wealth comes a wealth of information.


					  
					


We aim for solid investment returns with a special emphasis on capital preservation. To do so, we employ a comprehensive, common sense investment approach, combining our “Big Picture” insight with a thorough security selection process. Our observations and insights on these issues have shaped our portfolio strategy, asset allocation and risk controls since 1979. 


Big-Picture Insight (Top-Down Analysis)
We have long observed that markets often fail to grasp the significance of important global factors that shape asset returns and risk prospects. These factors include questions such as inflation or deflation, cyclical or secular, stimulus or austerity. Sometimes these factors highlight huge risks hiding in plain sight that few notice and act on, like a mania in technology stocks, excessive leverage in the financial system, or a new, ill-advised policy from Washington. Other times they offer insight on the opportunity for gains.
Marrying our view of the macro-environment with each client need is the critical function at Cadinha & Company and our defining difference.


Interest Rates
Interest rates are not just key to the income and price of a bond, they are a key component in measuring the value of stocks. And interest rate considerations often are global. We study interest rates—and the top-down factors that shape them—to identify value and risks.  While it’s rarely possible to predict the short-term direction of interest rates, we believe that occasional policy changes (among other things) can significantly influence the direction of interest rates, and thus the direction of stocks, bonds and other asset classes.


Inflation / Deflation
Everyone knows that inflation means that prices increase for most of the goods and services we consume. But inflation has even wider ramifications in regards to investing and financial risk management. Inflation is also the devaluation of our money and a key component of interest rates. Higher inflation usually means higher interest rates, and deflation (yes, this is possible) does the opposite. Like interest rates, inflation is largely shaped by global fiscal and monetary policy—sometimes directly so. Inflation is also a key component of our stock analyses. All things equal, we prefer investing in companies with pricing power; companies that can successfully raise prices can protect against inflation—and even benefit from it—over time.


Taxes & Regulation
We closely monitor taxes and regulations because we know people respond to incentives and must adhere to rules. Changes in taxes—including income taxes, capital gains taxes, corporate taxes, and others—directly influence returns. Changes in the tax code that favor one form of income (like dividends) over others (like corporate bond interest) will incentivize investors to sell the higher tax income and buy the lower tax one. Regulations not only dictate actions and behavior but  can also be a valuable source of protection for certain assets and companies while being the bane of others. In an era of increasing and changing regulation, even global investors ignore Washington at their peril.


Growth
While it’s important to focus on the growth of individual stocks, we think it’s also important to keep an eye on economic growth—where it’s happening and why. We care about where we are in the economic cycle and look for secular growth drivers, including demographics, productivity, trade, and policies to assess headwinds and tailwinds among regions and asset types. Within stocks, professional investors like to label stocks as either “growth” or “value.” We believe growth and value are inextricably linked—growth is a vital component of value. We seek companies with both growth attributes and value prices.


Monetary Policy
The influence of the world’s central banks has grown exponentially to the point that many are as powerful and influential as the governments they serve. Today, central banks including the Federal Reserve have many policy objectives to fulfill including full employment, growth, low and stable inflation, regulation, and a virtually limitless mandate to print and erase money. Perhaps never before has the Fed been so directly in control of interest rates and inflation, and as influential in asset returns. An almost natural business cycle has been increasingly replaced by a policy cycle, and it isn’t difficult to ascertain its tailwinds and headwinds. More difficult, and important, is identifying the risks and ramifications.


Our top-down and bottom-up insights combine to create a forward-looking asset allocation strategy—one that’s poised for the perceived risks and opportunities ahead, rather than based on past performance or conventional practices.
The final step involves you, our client. Your Cadinha adviser will work with you, now and over time, to customize our investment strategies and insights regarding financial planning, money management, and allocating the best investments for your individual needs.


Stocks: Business Model
Durable and profitable business model. We look for understandable businesses to invest in that have high and consistent returns on equity and capital to go along with a solid, long-term business plan.


Stocks: Management
Honest and able management. We look for talented management teams that think and act like owners. We focus on a key function of management: capital allocation, or what management does with earnings.


Stocks: Price
A cheap or reasonable price. Price is always a key determinant to any investment’s return and risk prospects.


Bonds
Rather than just seeking income by holding a large number of fixed income securities across maturities and among various issuers, we seek total return (income plus capital appreciation) with a fixed income strategy based largely on our market views. We choose bond maturities based on our interest rate views and issuers based on their credit quality and yield.


Cash
While most professional wealth managers eschew the idea of holding cash in client accounts, cash is a constant investment consideration for us. We will hold cash—sometimes in substantial amounts—to hedge against elevated risks.  Holding cash also gives us increased power to seize compelling investment opportunities in the future.


Other Assets
Though we mainly invest in stocks and bonds, from time to time our top-down work identifies investment opportunities in other asset types such as gold, currencies and real estate-based securities. We may invest in these types of assets to hedge perceived macroeconomic risks and provide portfolio diversification or to seek additional returns.


Research-Driven Investments (Bottom-Up Analysis)
We rely on an intensive, research-driven process to identify liquid securities that meet our stringent criteria.
No matter what assets we choose to invest in, we will maintain high standards for quality and liquidity and acknowledge that some investment ideas and asset classes are simply un-investable.

					Philosophy
				





Could you afford to lose half your life's savings?


How about a third of it? Or a quarter? It's a question we hope you never have to answer but one worth considering. And it's central to Cadinha & Company’s philosophy regarding money management. We call it aggressive preservation.
Get rich slow.
Preservation can be a loaded word because it conjures up images of treading water as opposed to making forward progress. But that’s not the case with Cadinha.

					Because we believe that it’s nearly impossible to build wealth while experiencing periodic, severe losses, our first priority is to preserve what you have worked so hard to save.
				

					By seeking investment opportunities that present good upside potential with little risk, we preserve your ability to grow. After all, your capital is what we put to work to build wealth.
				
But not too slow.
Our approach to investing is a prudent one. But it’s not so conservative that we lose sight of the fact that our aim is not only to preserve capital but also to deliver solid returns.
And with no hidden fees.
We don’t know what fees your current financial adviser is charging. Then again, maybe you don’t either. At Cadinha & Company our financial advisory fees are pretty straightforward. We charge an annual 1% fee for portfolios ranging from $1 million to $3 million and decreasing amounts for assets beyond that. Hidden and exorbitant fees? Not our thing. They don't align with our central philosophy of preservation because they chip away at your capital. That's the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish for you. 


					geese in formation
					know the shape of victory

					Fiduciary
				





So, what’s it gonna take to get you into a new heart?


It’s difficult to imagine ever hearing something like that from your physician. But that, in a nutshell, is the difference between a salesperson and an adviser. The motivation for the salesperson is the sale. The motivation for the adviser is your best interest. 
Cadinha & Company investment advisers are registered by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As named fiduciaries under this law, we must operate under a higher standard of responsibility to our clients. In other words, as fiduciaries, we are legally obligated to look after you, not sell you. 

					We could never let conflicts of interests such as commissions, sales quotas and selling bonuses cloud our judgment when making investment decisions for our clients.
				
Many financial advisers are not fiduciaries and therefore have no such obligation. Some approach their practice simply as a means to make sales and collect sizable commissions and fees. They sell all kinds of products like mutual funds, annuities, structured notes, limited partnerships, hedge funds and managed futures. We sell no products, collect no commissions and have no sales quotas or selling bonuses. We want no conflicts like these to cloud our judgment when making investment decisions for our clients.
Salesperson or Cadinha investment adviser? Seems like a pretty easy decision.


					the sun and the rain
					give each other a rainbow
					sharing in the gold
					











					Fee-Only
				





The 1% solution.


At Cadinha & Company we have a novel approach to making money: we do what's best for our clients. That's why we choose to employ a transparent, low fee-only schedule.
No dinging every transaction. No commissions. No hidden fees of any kind.
Just an annual 1% fee for portfolios between $1 million and $3 million and lower fees (as low as .40%) beyond that.


1% first $3 million of assets under management
.75% on the next $2 million
.50% on the next $5 million
.40% on additional amounts


Do we do this out of the goodness of our hearts? Maybe a little, but mostly, we do it because our business model hinges on your success. Our philosophy is to build wealth while preserving client capital. The more wealth we build for our clients, the more we earn. Our clients’ interests and ours are the same—to make more money.

					Tools+
				





It's really about the plus.


What analytical tools and investment information do we have access to at Cadinha & Company? These for starters:

Economic and market data
Securities data on 50,000+ publicly traded entities around the globe from pork	bellies to Mongolian bonds to small Irish banks
Wall Street research
Independent research
Public filings
Research and analysis from economists

But guess what? Our competitors have, for the most part, access to the same tools and information. It's the same way with craftsmen. They all have the same tools, so what is it that makes the difference? The craftsmanship.
And then there’s our artistry.
 We make this distinction because with craftsmanship the focus is on one’s finesse using existing tools. Artistry adds the ability to conceive of a tool that doesn’t yet exist. And as it turns out, that is what happened 40 years ago with the creation of a proprietary model that has allowed us to keep a living history of quantitative data in the context of macroeconomic conditions.
As it was envisioned then, the model now contains an accumulated 40 years of market performance data, meticulously updated along the way. When queried with a set of macroeconomic “what ifs,” it provides quantitatively derived probabilities for the future performance of any market, benchmark, or asset class in which we are contemplating investing. This valuable information is added to our arsenal when making decisions as to how we allocate assets.
The person deserving credit for this creation is our own Chief Economist, Victor Canto, Ph.D. He has studied macroeconomics in regard to investments his entire career and helps us examine macroeconomic trends, fiscal monetary policy, the interplay between the two, and how it all affects asset performance.
Victor has been part of our Investment Committee for many years. This committee—each member with decades of experience—comes to the table to test ideas, learn from one another, ask questions, think, worry about what could go wrong and envision what should go right. We seek the best means of minimizing your risk. We look for the great opportunities. And then we wait, investing only when we feel the time is right.

					The most valuable thing that Cadinha has to offer you isn't the list you see above, but how we use it.
				
Our Investment Committee
At Cadinha & Company, we have an investment committee of six that meets regularly. This team—each member with decades of experience—comes to the table to test ideas, learn from one another, ask questions, think, worry about what could go wrong and envision what should go right. We seek the best means of minimizing your risk. We look for the great opportunities. And then we wait, investing only when we feel the time is right.
We are fortunate to have an additional committee member who helps us examine economic trends, fiscal monetary policy, the interplay between the two, and how it all affects asset allocation—Victor Canto, Ph.D. Dr. Canto is founder and chairman of La Jolla Economics. He's studied macroeconomics in regard to investments for nearly 40 years.
Our Business Model
Because we don’t rely on the sale of any products for our income, we’re not busy selling our clients the new new thing. Instead, we use our time to study and reflect on the information and data we gather. All with the goal to make the best investments for our clients.

What we do matters, but so does how we do it.


The Client Experience
At Cadinha & Company we believe very much in long-term relationships. By forming lasting partnerships with our clients we get to know them and develop a deep understanding of their financial and lifestyle goals, especially as those goals shift toward retirement planning.. 
We maintain a low client-to-staff ratio and give our clients access to the decision makers at our firm. When you call, a person answers, not a machine. You'll have our email addresses. And, you're encouraged to call or write at any time. 
All this isn't just to make you feel important. You are important and we treat you that way.
Financial Planning Cadinha Style
At Cadinha & Company, we have our own definition of financial planning. It has nothing to do with generic forms or formulaic investment styles. Rather, we get to know you. We learn about your assets, income, estate plan, taxes and other financial matters. We also want to hear about the people and things that matter most in your life.
Next we ask you to envision your future so that we can see everything you see. Because we’ve been helping people achieve their financial goals since 1979, we’ve learned to see all that and more.
Like how shifting your financial priorities can serve you to better grow and preserve your wealth. Or knowing when it’s in your best interest for us to engage in real collaboration with your tax and legal advisors. Or even how we can educate your heirs about the advantages we’re creating for you, and ultimately, them.
From private to business matters; from cash flow management to lifetime needs; from buying and selling assets to gifting the important ones in your life – Cadinha & Company shows your financial life how to provide five-star service to your real life.
Customized Investment Management
Just as no two people are alike, no two investors are alike, so a “one-size-fits-all” approach really ends up fitting no one. Cadinha & Company manages each account separately so we can tailor it to each client’s needs.
Your unique goals and individual tolerance for risk will influence the approach we take to growing your wealth.
If there's a specific amount of cash you need generated each year, we'll customize your portfolio with that goal in mind. If you wish to invest more heavily in foreign markets, we offer a unique approach to a dedicated global portfolio. We also take note of your particular tax situation and how it impacts what you wish to achieve. And if you have any value-based parameters that might prevent you from investing in certain companies or sectors, we factor that in as well. 
Finally, we consider your present capacity for income generation as well as other assets you own. Are you working? Own a company? Have holdings elsewhere? Own real estate? These details impact how we customize your investment plan and manage your assets. What it all comes down to is that you are you, and we treat you as such.

Reporting
We keep it simple. Quarterly reports are brief and easy to read. Accounting is straightforward and transparent. And because all trades are made through your personal brokerage account, you can log in at your leisure to check positions, gains and losses, dividends and more. Like every other aspect of our service, reporting is designed to be of maximum benefit to you.

Beyond Investment Management

					Because we develop deep and long-lasting relationships with our clients, we often serve as their financial right arm during times of transition. Our clients trust our financial expertise. And our business expertise. And us.
				

					We go beyond investment management, because life doesn’t exist in a portfolio. It can only be protected by one.
				
Cadinha & Company can help create the strategies and manage the efforts for any number of financial challenges in which families and businesses find themselves, like:

unwinding complicated ownership positions
private family business transitions
disposition of private business equity
charitable gifting programs
moving assets to future generations
succession planning
transitioning to retirement
estate planning
long-term financial strategies
helping heirs find the most advantageous way to receive assets

When necessary, we consult with other specialized professionals whose advice helps us achieve our clients’ goals. In other words, we know what we don’t know. We have trusted relationships with a broad range of experts such as actuaries, attorneys, tax counsel and business valuation specialists. And we know when to call them in.
Because every situation is unique, this service is designed to accomplish very particular outcomes. And once we know what steps need to be taken, we provide an estimate for implementing the path to a successful transition.
Our philosophy of preserving what our clients have spent their lives creating is where everything begins and ends with us. We go beyond investment management, because life doesn’t exist in a portfolio. It can only be protected by one.

					History
				





It all startedwith a man whowanted to dothe right thing. 


Harlan J. Cadinha spent the first 11 years of his career at a large brokerage firm. There, he witnessed the inherent conflict between what the firm expected (make lots of trades to generate lots of fees and push products to benefit the firm) and what was in his clients' best interests. Harlan knew there was a better way. 
From its very founding in 1979 Cadinha & Company has been different. And this wasn't an easy time to be different or to launch a company. In 1979 inflation was 11%, the price of gold had doubled and the Dow Jones had risen just 33 points for the year. But Harlan had a vision. A vision of a firm that would make investment decisions based on clients' needs. One that would understand macroeconomic trends in order to allocate assets based on where an investment was likely headed, not where it had been. An asset management firm that didn’t sell products, but was valued for its wisdom.
Today Cadinha & Company stands as a testament to the ideal that great success can come from putting client needs first. 
Clients stayed; a number are third-generation. And so did advisers; their average tenure is 24 years. Cadinha is one of Hawaii's largest and oldest investment advisers with managed assets over $1.1 billion and clients in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Through managing risk, or in Harlan's words, "staying out of trouble," Cadinha & Company has steadily and strategically built wealth for a discerning client base. A base that we’d like to grow by one more—you.

Investment Commentary: June 30, 2017
13 Jul 2017 | Neil Rose
Over the past quarter we added to overall stock and bond investments as corporate earnings improved and inflation declined. 
In Washington, Republicans have made little progress implementing their agenda.  Latest reports are of disagreements among Republicans themselves on healthcare and taxes.  Expectations vary, including our own, on whether there will ultimately be substantive change on either front.   Time is running out before another election year arrives, and legislation or compromise become even harder to accomplish.   
We maintain that the kinds of tax cuts proposed would raise the intrinsic value of assets materially, especially those of cash generating businesses paying the full federal tax rate of 35%.  With all the disagreement and disorganization within the GOP and the president’s behavior, it’s hard to see the market being certain about lower taxes.  If this is the case, then markets would likely jump if a tax cut is ultimately passed.  
While politics have ruled headlines, a pleasant surprise has come in the form of strong corporate earnings over the first half of 2017.  Corporate earnings had been negative for the six quarters prior to 2017.  Forward earnings estimates from Wall Street may be too high, however, and there is a good chance earnings growth will slow going forward, requiring fiscal policy (i.e. tax cuts) to take the baton to justify higher prices.

BARRON’S: Now You See Them…A Vanishing Act for Stocks




			Harlan Cadinha is bullish on U.S. equities. The chairman of Honolulu-based wealth manager Cadinha dwells on a phenomenon you wouldn't think of as upbeat: the shrinking number of public listings of U.S. companies. The World Federation of Exchanges reports that the combined number of companies listed on the New York, American, and Nasdaq exchanges swooned to 5,008 last year from a 1997 peak of 8,823 - a 43% decline, or a loss of 238 companies on average each year. "Fewer stocks mean higher prices," he says.

Trump Portfolios

				We believe that the election of Donald Trump marks a policy inflection point. Even if tax rates and the regulatory burden do not decline by much, they denote quite a change in the trend of rising regulations and rising marginal tax rates produced by Obamanomics.

				We don’t think like typical financial advisers.
			






The here view.Not the rear view. 


Take a moment and think about how you typically drive down a road. The majority of time you look ahead, constantly assessing factors like road conditions, other traffic, and speed. Only occasionally do you glance in the rearview mirror. Now, what if you tried to do it the other way around? It wouldn’t be long before you wound up wrapped around a telephone pole.
Cadinha & Company believes that wealth management works much the same way. We’re rarely driving in familiar territory these days. Therefore, we don’t put much faith in how investments performed in the past. Or in worn-out ideas such as Modern Portfolio Theory or being 100% invested in the market.
We don’t think like a typical financial adviser. Because, at our core, we’re risk managers. We’ve put together some questions to ask yourself. And in some cases, included our thoughts for you to consider. If you find yourself nodding in agreement, we could be the right investment adviser for you.








How does your financial adviser make money?


If you only charged 1% you'd be transparent about it, too.

					Our financial advisory fees are simple and straightforward: an annual 1% fee for portfolios between $1 million and $3 million and lower fees (as low as .40%) beyond that.
					  

Learn More








Does your financial planner use mutual funds?


The feeling’s not mutual.
With separate accounts and individual securities, we have the ability to customize a portfolio and investment strategy that’s tailored to you in a way that holding products like mutual funds cannot be. Let's take a closer look and compare the two approaches side by side:  
Learn More







SOMETHING TO CONSIDER
Does your financial adviser have a clear investment philosophy?






Do youstrategicallyhold cash inyour portfolio?


Stick and move.

					Cash is king. If you’ve got it, you have the power to say “when” and pounce on an investment opportunity without having to sell an asset you like and getting hit with a tax. 
					Holding cash also allows you the luxury to sit on the sidelines until risk subsides. 
				
Learn More








Does your financial adviser’s global investment strategy seem a bit like tithing?


Investing globally isn’t something you should do on faith.

					We’ll invest (almost) anywhere, but only if we can prove to ourselves it’s worth the risk.
				
Learn More








Your portfolio + macroeconomics + geopolitics = concern?


Does your financial adviser take into consideration how the national debt, global debt, government spending, regulations, interest rates, unfunded pensions, tax rates, stimulus, currency fluctuations, health care, emerging markets, inflation, deflation, terrorism, immigration, China, Russia, unemployment, the dollar, oil, the technical revolution, and the lack of 76 million baby boomers buying and furnishing homes and raising families affect your investments? 
We do.







SOMETHING TO CONSIDER
Do you know what you're invested in and why?






Does your financial adviser focus on relative performance?


Losing isn’t winning.
If your portfolio is down 20% this year but your financial adviser’s benchmark of, say, the S&P 500 is down 25%, your adviser would call you a winner. In fact, he’d probably even expect a pat on the back. After all, you “beat” the market. But, hold on, you’ve just lost a fifth of your life’s savings. Hip, hip, hooray? 
Learn More








Asset allocation. Performance. Random. Which word doesn’t belong?


“Random” isn’t a word in our vocabulary, no matter how trendy it is.
We don’t believe in random. We believe in the people and tools we have developed over the past 40 years to understand trends in a way few others do.
Learn More








Annuities: do you know what you’re getting into?


Welcome to the Hotel California . . . of investments.
Investing can often seem like a dark desert highway, especially if you're not an expert. So when you see a shimmering light, it's tempting to want to check in. That's the lure of annuities. Such a lovely place. But as the well-known song suggests, anything that appears too good to be true probably is. And annuities, while tempting, have some pretty big downsides. So big that we don't recommend them. And make no mistake about it—annuities are never bought, they're sold. 
Learn More






SOMETHING TO CONSIDER
Have you been sold products vs. been advised?






Must your adviser act solely on your behalf?


Cadinha & Company investment advisers are registered by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As named fiduciaries under this law, we must operate under a higher standard of responsibility to our clients. In other words, as fiduciaries, we are legally obligated to look after you, not sell you.
Many financial advisers are not fiduciaries and therefore have no such obligation. Some approach their practice simply as a means to make sales and collect sizable commissions and fees. They sell all kinds of products like mutual funds, annuities, structured notes, limited partnerships, hedge funds and managed futures. We sell no products, collect no commissions and have no sales quotas or selling bonuses. We want no conflicts like these to cloud our judgment when making investment decisions for our clients.









Do you, andshould you, owna lot of bonds?


Perhaps you should rethink exactly what is conservative?
For most, “conservative” means investing in cash and perhaps bonds. Conventional wisdom supports this: bonds are always more conservative than stocks and one can’t go wrong holding on to cash. But is this always the case?  
Learn More






SOMETHING TO CONSIDER
Is your life's savings at risk?






Does your financial adviser believe in investing on margin?


There are only two times when an investor shouldn’t use leverage for speculation: when she can’t afford to and when she can.








Does your financial planner dare utter the“R” word?


It’s risky not to talk about risk.
Risk is everywhere, whether your financial adviser downplays it or not. Once you get it out in the open, though, better decisions can be made and risk can be managed to your benefit.

Do you own complicated investments?


Structured products, payout profiles and downside protection, oh my.

SOMETHING TO CONSIDER
How ready are you to weather a down market?

					Philosophy
				





Could you afford to lose half your life's savings?


How about a third of it? Or a quarter? It's a question we hope you never have to answer but one worth considering. And it's central to Cadinha & Company’s philosophy regarding money management. We call it aggressive preservation.
Get rich slow.
Preservation can be a loaded word because it conjures up images of treading water as opposed to making forward progress. But that’s not the case with Cadinha.

					Because we believe that it’s nearly impossible to build wealth while experiencing periodic, severe losses, our first priority is to preserve what you have worked so hard to save.
				

					By seeking investment opportunities that present good upside potential with little risk, we preserve your ability to grow. After all, your capital is what we put to work to build wealth.
				
But not too slow.
Our approach to investing is a prudent one. But it’s not so conservative that we lose sight of the fact that our aim is not only to preserve capital but also to deliver solid returns.
And with no hidden fees.
We don’t know what fees your current financial adviser is charging. Then again, maybe you don’t either. At Cadinha & Company our financial advisory fees are pretty straightforward. We charge an annual 1% fee for portfolios ranging from $1 million to $3 million and decreasing amounts for assets beyond that. Hidden and exorbitant fees? Not our thing. They don't align with our central philosophy of preservation because they chip away at your capital. That's the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish for you. 


					geese in formation
					know the shape of victory
					they take it often
					











					Fiduciary
				





So, what’s it gonna take to get you into a new heart?


It’s difficult to imagine ever hearing something like that from your physician. But that, in a nutshell, is the difference between a salesperson and an adviser. The motivation for the salesperson is the sale. The motivation for the adviser is your best interest. 
Cadinha & Company investment advisers are registered by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As named fiduciaries under this law, we must operate under a higher standard of responsibility to our clients. In other words, as fiduciaries, we are legally obligated to look after you, not sell you. 

					We could never let conflicts of interests such as commissions, sales quotas and selling bonuses cloud our judgment when making investment decisions for our clients.
				
Many financial advisers are not fiduciaries and therefore have no such obligation. Some approach their practice simply as a means to make sales and collect sizable commissions and fees. They sell all kinds of products like mutual funds, annuities, structured notes, limited partnerships, hedge funds and managed futures. We sell no products, collect no commissions and have no sales quotas or selling bonuses. We want no conflicts like these to cloud our judgment when making investment decisions for our clients.
Salesperson or Cadinha investment adviser? Seems like a pretty easy decision.


					the sun and the rain
					give each other a rainbow
					sharing in the gold
					











					Fee-Only
				





The 1% solution.


At Cadinha & Company we have a novel approach to making money: we do what's best for our clients. That's why we choose to employ a transparent, low fee-only schedule.
No dinging every transaction. No commissions. No hidden fees of any kind.
Just an annual 1% fee for portfolios between $1 million and $3 million and lower fees (as low as .40%) beyond that.


1% first $3 million of assets under management
.75% on the next $2 million
.50% on the next $5 million
.40% on additional amounts


Do we do this out of the goodness of our hearts? Maybe a little, but mostly, we do it because our business model hinges on your success. Our philosophy is to build wealth while preserving client capital. The more wealth we build for our clients, the more we earn. Our clients’ interests and ours are the same—to make more money.

					the gardener’s glee erupts

					Tools+
				





It's really about the plus.


What analytical tools and investment information do we have access to at Cadinha & Company? These for starters:

Economic and market data
Securities data on 50,000+ publicly traded entities around the globe from pork	bellies to Mongolian bonds to small Irish banks
Wall Street research
Independent research
Public filings
Research and analysis from economists

But guess what? Our competitors have, for the most part, access to the same tools and information. It's the same way with craftsmen. They all have the same tools, so what is it that makes the difference? The craftsmanship.
And then there’s our artistry.
 We make this distinction because with craftsmanship the focus is on one’s finesse using existing tools. Artistry adds the ability to conceive of a tool that doesn’t yet exist. And as it turns out, that is what happened 40 years ago with the creation of a proprietary model that has allowed us to keep a living history of quantitative data in the context of macroeconomic conditions.
As it was envisioned then, the model now contains an accumulated 40 years of market performance data, meticulously updated along the way. When queried with a set of macroeconomic “what ifs,” it provides quantitatively derived probabilities for the future performance of any market, benchmark, or asset class in which we are contemplating investing. This valuable information is added to our arsenal when making decisions as to how we allocate assets.
The person deserving credit for this creation is our own Chief Economist, Victor Canto, Ph.D. He has studied macroeconomics in regard to investments his entire career and helps us examine macroeconomic trends, fiscal monetary policy, the interplay between the two, and how it all affects asset performance.
Victor has been part of our Investment Committee for many years. This committee—each member with decades of experience—comes to the table to test ideas, learn from one another, ask questions, think, worry about what could go wrong and envision what should go right. We seek the best means of minimizing your risk. We look for the great opportunities. And then we wait, investing only when we feel the time is right.

					The most valuable thing that Cadinha has to offer you isn't the list you see above, but how we use it.
				
Our Investment Committee
At Cadinha & Company, we have an investment committee of six that meets regularly. This team—each member with decades of experience—comes to the table to test ideas, learn from one another, ask questions, think, worry about what could go wrong and envision what should go right. We seek the best means of minimizing your risk. We look for the great opportunities. And then we wait, investing only when we feel the time is right.
We are fortunate to have an additional committee member who helps us examine economic trends, fiscal monetary policy, the interplay between the two, and how it all affects asset allocation—Victor Canto, Ph.D. Dr. Canto is founder and chairman of La Jolla Economics. He's studied macroeconomics in regard to investments for nearly 40 years.
Our Business Model
Because we don’t rely on the sale of any products for our income, we’re not busy selling our clients the new new thing. Instead, we use our time to study and reflect on the information and data we gather. All with the goal to make the best investments for our clients.

What we do matters, but so does how we do it.


The Client Experience
At Cadinha & Company we believe very much in long-term relationships. By forming lasting partnerships with our clients we get to know them and develop a deep understanding of their financial and lifestyle goals, especially as those goals shift toward retirement planning.. 
We maintain a low client-to-staff ratio and give our clients access to the decision makers at our firm. When you call, a person answers, not a machine. You'll have our email addresses. And, you're encouraged to call or write at any time. 
All this isn't just to make you feel important. You are important and we treat you that way.
Financial Planning Cadinha Style
At Cadinha & Company, we have our own definition of financial planning. It has nothing to do with generic forms or formulaic investment styles. Rather, we get to know you. We learn about your assets, income, estate plan, taxes and other financial matters. We also want to hear about the people and things that matter most in your life.
Next we ask you to envision your future so that we can see everything you see. Because we’ve been helping people achieve their financial goals since 1979, we’ve learned to see all that and more.
Like how shifting your financial priorities can serve you to better grow and preserve your wealth. Or knowing when it’s in your best interest for us to engage in real collaboration with your tax and legal advisors. Or even how we can educate your heirs about the advantages we’re creating for you, and ultimately, them.
From private to business matters; from cash flow management to lifetime needs; from buying and selling assets to gifting the important ones in your life – Cadinha & Company shows your financial life how to provide five-star service to your real life.
Customized Investment Management
Just as no two people are alike, no two investors are alike, so a “one-size-fits-all” approach really ends up fitting no one. Cadinha & Company manages each account separately so we can tailor it to each client’s needs.
Your unique goals and individual tolerance for risk will influence the approach we take to growing your wealth.
If there's a specific amount of cash you need generated each year, we'll customize your portfolio with that goal in mind. If you wish to invest more heavily in foreign markets, we offer a unique approach to a dedicated global portfolio. We also take note of your particular tax situation and how it impacts what you wish to achieve. And if you have any value-based parameters that might prevent you from investing in certain companies or sectors, we factor that in as well. 
Finally, we consider your present capacity for income generation as well as other assets you own. Are you working? Own a company? Have holdings elsewhere? Own real estate? These details impact how we customize your investment plan and manage your assets. What it all comes down to is that you are you, and we treat you as such.

Reporting
We keep it simple. Quarterly reports are brief and easy to read. Accounting is straightforward and transparent. And because all trades are made through your personal brokerage account, you can log in at your leisure to check positions, gains and losses, dividends and more. Like every other aspect of our service, reporting is designed to be of maximum benefit to you.

Beyond Investment Management

					Because we develop deep and long-lasting relationships with our clients, we often serve as their financial right arm during times of transition. Our clients trust our financial expertise. And our business expertise. And us.
				

					We go beyond investment management, because life doesn’t exist in a portfolio. It can only be protected by one.
				
Cadinha & Company can help create the strategies and manage the efforts for any number of financial challenges in which families and businesses find themselves, like:

unwinding complicated ownership positions
private family business transitions
disposition of private business equity
charitable gifting programs
moving assets to future generations
succession planning
transitioning to retirement
estate planning
long-term financial strategies
helping heirs find the most advantageous way to receive assets

When necessary, we consult with other specialized professionals whose advice helps us achieve our clients’ goals. In other words, we know what we don’t know. We have trusted relationships with a broad range of experts such as actuaries, attorneys, tax counsel and business valuation specialists. And we know when to call them in.
Because every situation is unique, this service is designed to accomplish very particular outcomes. And once we know what steps need to be taken, we provide an estimate for implementing the path to a successful transition.
Our philosophy of preserving what our clients have spent their lives creating is where everything begins and ends with us. We go beyond investment management, because life doesn’t exist in a portfolio. It can only be protected by one.

					History
				





It all startedwith a man whowanted to dothe right thing. 


Harlan J. Cadinha spent the first 11 years of his career at a large brokerage firm. There, he witnessed the inherent conflict between what the firm expected (make lots of trades to generate lots of fees and push products to benefit the firm) and what was in his clients' best interests. Harlan knew there was a better way. 
From its very founding in 1979 Cadinha & Company has been different. And this wasn't an easy time to be different or to launch a company. In 1979 inflation was 11%, the price of gold had doubled and the Dow Jones had risen just 33 points for the year. But Harlan had a vision. A vision of a firm that would make investment decisions based on clients' needs. One that would understand macroeconomic trends in order to allocate assets based on where an investment was likely headed, not where it had been. An asset management firm that didn’t sell products, but was valued for its wisdom.
Today Cadinha & Company stands as a testament to the ideal that great success can come from putting client needs first. 
Clients stayed; a number are third-generation. And so did advisers; their average tenure is 24 years. Cadinha is one of Hawaii's largest and oldest investment advisers with managed assets over $1.1 billion and clients in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Through managing risk, or in Harlan's words, "staying out of trouble," Cadinha & Company has steadily and strategically built wealth for a discerning client base. A base that we’d like to grow by one more—you.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

LLC Pricing Packages - Affordable LLC Formation Services from LegalZoomWhen you decided to form an LLC, one of your first questions may have been "how much does an LLC cost"? Fortunately, LegalZoom makes the process of starting an LLC affordable and simple. With three LLC pricing packages to choose from, there is a package to fit the needs of any business. The Economy package LLC cost includes filing of the document forming the LLC with the state, a personalized operating agreement, name availability check, a financial account authorization letter, and a 30 business day turnaround. Standard package LLC fees include everything from the Economy package with a 15 business day turnaround, plus a company seal and binder, and 20 customized membership certificates. The Express Gold LLC formation package includes everything from the Standard package with a 7-10 business day turnaround, plus a Federal Tax ID (EIN) (discounted and expedited), a tax consultation with 1-800Accountant, and a 30-day trial of attorney advice. Get started forming an LLC by answering a few questions about your business. We'll assemble your LLC documents and file them directly with the appropriate state agency and you'll receive your completed LLC package by mail. The LLC price for all packages includes a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a Peace of Mind Review.







1After the 30-day trial period, benefits to the Business Legal Plan (also Business Advantage Pro or Business Advisory Plan) continue automatically at the plan rate (currently $39.99 per month). Cancel by calling (877) 818-8787. For full details, see the Legal Plan Contract and Subscription Terms.2Some restrictions apply.

Please see the LLC Knowledge Center for examples of these fees. You may also contact the state, an accountant or LegalZoom for more information about these fees.4Once your LLC becomes legally effective, your card will automatically be charged $159.00. Service renews annually thereafter for the same fee until canceled. For full terms and conditions, click here. ** Does not include required newspaper publication fee.
