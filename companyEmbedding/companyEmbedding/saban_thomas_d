Etymology[edit]
The origin of the name "Saba" comes from the Arabic word Sabha, meaning the Biblical kingdom of Sheba.[citation needed]
Energy[edit]
Like many Caribbean islands, Saba is highly dependent on fossil fuels imports, which leaves it vulnerable to global oil price fluctuations that directly impact the cost of electricity.[6] Current electricity supply depends entirely on one diesel power plant located close to sea level by the harbour and it is estimated that fifty per cent of the cost of electricity is related to the price of fossil fuels and lubricants.[7] According to a report by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), the Government of Saba made the decision to transform the island to 100% sustainable energy to eventually eliminate dependence on fossil fuel-generated electricity. This new energy policy is defined by the ‘Social development plan 2014–2020’ and ‘Saba's energy sector strategy’. Intermediate targets are 20% renewable electricity by 2017 and 40% by 2020.[7]
History[edit]
Christopher Columbus is said to have sighted the island on 13 November 1493. He did not land, being deterred by the island's perilous rocky shores. In 1632, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen landed upon Saba. They stated they found the island uninhabited when they were rescued, however, clear evidence has been found indicating that Caribs and Arawak Native Nations have lived on the island.
In 1635, a stray Frenchman claimed Saba for Louis XIII of France. In the latter 1630s, the Dutch Governor of the neighboring island of Sint Eustatius sent several Dutch families over to colonize the island for the Dutch West India Company. In 1664, refusing to swear allegiance to the English crown, these original Dutch settlers were evicted to St. Maarten by Thomas Morgan and other English pirates that had been convicted to stay on Jamaica, to return within the months and years following. The Netherlands have been in continuous possession of Saba since 1816, after numerous flag changes (British-Dutch-French) during the previous centuries.[citation needed] By 2016 the island had been French for 12 years, English for 18 years and Dutch for 345 years.
In the 17th and 18th centuries Saba's major industries were sugar, indigo and rum produced on plantations owned by Dutchmen living on St Eustatius, and later fishing, particularly lobster fishing. In the 17th century Saba was believed to be a favorable hideout for Jamaican pirates. England also deported its "undesirable" people to live in the Caribbean colonies, and some of them also became pirates, a few taking haven on Saba. The island of Saba is forbidding and steep, a natural fortress, and so the island became a private sanctuary for the families of smugglers and pirates. The most notable native Saban pirate was Hiram Beakes, who famously quipped, "Dead men tell no tales".[citation needed]
Later, legitimate sailing and trade became important, and many of the island's men took to the sea, during which time "Saba lace", which is pulled thread work, a Spanish form of needlework introduced by a nun from Venezuela, became an important product made by the island's women. Throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century, the primary source of revenue for the island came from the lacework produced by the women. During this period of time, with most of the island's men gone out to sea, the island became known as "The Island of Women".[8]
The remains of the settlements of 1630–40 can be found on the west side at Tent Bay. These settlements were destroyed by a landslide in the 17th century.
A status referendum was held in Saba on 5 November 2004. 86.05% of the population voted for closer links to the Netherlands.

Geography and ecology[edit]




Map of Saba from the Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West-Indië 1914-1917.

Saba consists largely of the potentially active volcano Mount Scenery. At 887 metres (2,910 ft) the volcano is the highest point within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
The vegetation of Saba is mainly composed of woodland forest with ferns and damp soil, and many mango trees. Visitors refer to Saba's forests as "the Elfin Forest" because of its high altitude mist, and mossy appearance. A woodland reserve was created and named "Elfin Forest Reserve". Saba's lush plant and animal wildlife is diverse and is cared for by the Saba Conservation Foundation.
There used to be forests of Mountain Mahogany trees until a hurricane in the 1960s destroyed many of the trees, which are Freziera undulata in the family Theaceae. Despite the common name, these trees are not related to other Mahogany species. One species of true mahogany tree is found planted on the island at lower levels, and that is the small-leaved mahogany Swietenia mahagoni, Meliaceae. The native mahogany trees are considered to be at risk of becoming extinct on Saba.
4.3 kilometres (2.7 mi) southwest of Saba is the edge of the Saba Bank, a very large submerged atoll with especially rich biodiversity. Saba Bank is the top of a sea mount and it is a prime fishing ground, particularly for lobster.
A non-governmental conservation organization, Saba Conservation Foundation, helps protect the nature and culture of the island.
Governance[edit]

Saba became a special municipality within the country of the Netherlands after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles on 10 October 2010.[9]
The head of the island is the Island Governor, current held by Jonathan G. A. Johnson.
Previous title holders include:

John Hassell
Charles Simmons
Edward Beaks
Richard Johnson
Moses Leverock
Henry Every
Wycliffe Smith
Sydney Sorton

Society[edit]




A typical Saba view.


The population of Saba (the Sabans) consists of 1,991 people who come from all over the world. Saba's small size has led to a fairly small number of island families, who can trace their last names back to around a half-dozen families. This means that many last names are shared around the island, the most numerous being Hassell and Johnson.
Most families are an intermixing of Dutch, English, Scottish, and African heritage. The population is also descended from the Irish who were exiled from that country after the accession of King Charles I of England in 1625. Charles exiled these Irish to the Caribbean in an effort to quell rebellion after he had forcibly procured their lands for his Scottish noble supporters.
Historically, Saba was traded among the many European nations that fought for power in the region. Slaves were also imported to work on Saba. In recent years Saba has become home to a large group of expatriates, and around 250 immigrants who are either students or teachers at the Saba University School of Medicine.
Languages[edit]
Both English and Dutch are spoken on the island and taught in schools, and both languages are official. Despite the island's Dutch affiliation, English is the principal language spoken on the island and has been used in its school system since the 19th century. English can therefore be used in communications of and to the government.[2] Saba English, a form of Virgin Islands Creole English, is the local vernacular.
Education and health[edit]
Saba is home to the Saba University School of Medicine, which was established by American expatriates in coordination with the government of the Netherlands. The school adds over 400 residents when classes are in session, and it is the prime educational attraction. A.M. Edwards Medical Center is the major provider of healthcare for local residents.
Same-sex marriage[edit]
In Saba (as in Bonaire and Sint Eustatius), marriage is open to same sex and opposite sex couples[10] following the entering in force of a law enabling also same-sex couples to marry on 10 October 2012.[11] The first same-sex marriage was performed on Saba on 4 December 2012 between a Dutch and a Venezuelan man, both residing in Aruba, where same-sex marriage is not performed.[12][13][14]
Economy[edit]
Main article: Economy of Saba
Since 2011 the U.S. dollar has been the official currency,[15] replacing the Netherlands Antillean guilder.
Agriculture on Saba is primarily livestock and vegetables, especially potatoes. Saba lace, also known as "Spanish work", is actually drawn thread work, and as of 2013[update], it is still produced on the island.
Tourism[edit]




A playground on Saba


The tourism industry now contributes more to the island's economy than any other sector. There are about 25,000 visitors each year. Saba has a number of inns, hotels, rental cottages and restaurants. Saba is known as "The Unspoiled Queen" of the Caribbean.[16] Saba is especially known for its ecotourism, having exceptional scuba diving, climbing and hiking.
The Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport offers flights to and from the nearby islands of St. Maarten and Sint Eustatius. There is also a ferry service from St. Maarten; the ferry boats "Dawn II ~ The Saba Ferry" and "The Edge" both travel to Saba three times a week. In addition, there are anchorages for private boats.[16]
About 150 species of fish have been found in Saba's waters.[17] A main draw for divers are the pinnacle dive sites, where magma pushed through the sea floor to create underwater towers of volcanic rock that start at about 300 feet (91 m) down and rise to about 85 feet (26 m) beneath the surface.[17] The waters around Saba were designated as the Saba National Marine Park in 1987, and are subject to government regulation to preserve the coral reefs and other marine life. The Saba Conservation Foundation has operated a hyperbaric chamber in case of diving emergencies, since 1991.[18]
Transport[edit]




A view of the village of Windwardside, taken from Mount Scenery.


There is one main road, known as "The Road". Its construction was masterminded by Josephus Lambert Hassell who, despite the common opinion of Dutch and Swiss engineers, believed that a road could be built.[19] He took a correspondence course in civil engineering and started building the road with a crew of locals in 1938.[20]
After five years of work the first section of the road from Fort Bay to The Bottom was completed. It was not until 1947 that the first motor vehicle arrived. In 1951 the road to Windwardside and St. Johns was opened and in 1958, the road was completed. Driving "The Road" is considered to be a daunting task, and the curves in Windwardside are extremely difficult to negotiate. Driving is on the right hand side.
In 1963[citation needed] Saba residents built the Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport. This 400-metre (1,300 ft) landing strip is reputed to be the shortest commercial runway in the world,[21] and is restricted. Only trained pilots flying small STOL airliners, such as the Twin Otter and the Britten-Norman Islander may land there, as well as helicopters. Consistent air service from Sint Maarten and Sint Eustatius is available through Winair.
In 1972, a pier was completed in Fort Bay to access the island. Travel is also provided by ferry services to and from Sint Maarten with the Dawn II and The Edge.
Of note are 800 steps carved from stone that reach from Ladder Bay to the settlement known as The Bottom. Until the late 20th century, everything that was brought to the island was carried up by hand using these steps. The steps are now often used by tourists who wish to experience an intense climb.
Cultural[edit]
Main article: Culture of Saba
Saba's houses have a cottage look with red roofs. The lifestyle is slow and old-fashioned with little nightlife, even with the emergence of an ecotourism industry in the last few decades. Sabans are proud of their history of environmental conservation, calling Saba "The Unspoiled Queen."
Saban women continue to make two traditional island products, Saba Lace and Saba Spice. Saba Lace is handstitched lace, which the island's women began making in the late 19th century and built into a thriving mail-order business with the United States. Saba Spice is a rum drink, brewed with a combination of spices.
As in other Caribbean locations, Sabans throw an annual Carnival. Saba's Carnival takes place the last week in July and includes parades, steel bands, competitions, and food.
Another event held in the capital The Bottom is 'Saba Day'. This is the national day of the island in which all offices, schools and stores are closed. The island celebrates its diversity and culture through various activities and parades. The Bottom holds host to a concert at the sports field where local and other Caribbean artists come to perform.
Sports[edit]
Only a few sports are played on Saba, including volleyball (the Saba Volleyball Association is a member of NORCECA) and basketball.

One species of true mahogany tree is found planted on the island at lower levels, and that is the small-leaved mahogany Swietenia mahagoni, Meliaceae. The native mahogany trees are considered to be at risk of becoming extinct on Saba.
4.3 kilometres (2.7 mi) southwest of Saba is the edge of the Saba Bank, a very large submerged atoll with especially rich biodiversity. Saba Bank is the top of a sea mount and it is a prime fishing ground, particularly for lobster.
A non-governmental conservation organization, Saba Conservation Foundation, helps protect the nature and culture of the island.

Society[edit]




A typical Saba view.


The population of Saba (the Sabans) consists of 1,991 people who come from all over the world. Saba's small size has led to a fairly small number of island families, who can trace their last names back to around a half-dozen families. This means that many last names are shared around the island, the most numerous being Hassell and Johnson.
Most families are an intermixing of Dutch, English, Scottish, and African heritage. The population is also descended from the Irish who were exiled from that country after the accession of King Charles I of England in 1625. Charles exiled these Irish to the Caribbean in an effort to quell rebellion after he had forcibly procured their lands for his Scottish noble supporters.
Historically, Saba was traded among the many European nations that fought for power in the region. Slaves were also imported to work on Saba. In recent years Saba has become home to a large group of expatriates, and around 250 immigrants who are either students or teachers at the Saba University School of Medicine.
Languages[edit]
Both English and Dutch are spoken on the island and taught in schools, and both languages are official. Despite the island's Dutch affiliation, English is the principal language spoken on the island and has been used in its school system since the 19th century. English can therefore be used in communications of and to the government.[2] Saba English, a form of Virgin Islands Creole English, is the local vernacular.
Education and health[edit]
Saba is home to the Saba University School of Medicine, which was established by American expatriates in coordination with the government of the Netherlands. The school adds over 400 residents when classes are in session, and it is the prime educational attraction. A.M. Edwards Medical Center is the major provider of healthcare for local residents.
Same-sex marriage[edit]
In Saba (as in Bonaire and Sint Eustatius), marriage is open to same sex and opposite sex couples[10] following the entering in force of a law enabling also same-sex couples to marry on 10 October 2012.[11] The first same-sex marriage was performed on Saba on 4 December 2012 between a Dutch and a Venezuelan man, both residing in Aruba, where same-sex marriage is not performed.[12][13][14]
Economy[edit]
Main article: Economy of Saba
Since 2011 the U.S. dollar has been the official currency,[15] replacing the Netherlands Antillean guilder.
Agriculture on Saba is primarily livestock and vegetables, especially potatoes. Saba lace, also known as "Spanish work", is actually drawn thread work, and as of 2013[update], it is still produced on the island.
Tourism[edit]

The tourism industry now contributes more to the island's economy than any other sector. There are about 25,000 visitors each year. Saba has a number of inns, hotels, rental cottages and restaurants. Saba is known as "The Unspoiled Queen" of the Caribbean.[16] Saba is especially known for its ecotourism, having exceptional scuba diving, climbing and hiking.
The Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport offers flights to and from the nearby islands of St. Maarten and Sint Eustatius. There is also a ferry service from St. Maarten; the ferry boats "Dawn II ~ The Saba Ferry" and "The Edge" both travel to Saba three times a week. In addition, there are anchorages for private boats.[16]
About 150 species of fish have been found in Saba's waters.[17] A main draw for divers are the pinnacle dive sites, where magma pushed through the sea floor to create underwater towers of volcanic rock that start at about 300 feet (91 m) down and rise to about 85 feet (26 m) beneath the surface.[17] The waters around Saba were designated as the Saba National Marine Park in 1987, and are subject to government regulation to preserve the coral reefs and other marine life. The Saba Conservation Foundation has operated a hyperbaric chamber in case of diving emergencies, since 1991.[18]
Transport[edit]

There is one main road, known as "The Road". Its construction was masterminded by Josephus Lambert Hassell who, despite the common opinion of Dutch and Swiss engineers, believed that a road could be built.[19] He took a correspondence course in civil engineering and started building the road with a crew of locals in 1938.[20]
After five years of work the first section of the road from Fort Bay to The Bottom was completed. It was not until 1947 that the first motor vehicle arrived. In 1951 the road to Windwardside and St. Johns was opened and in 1958, the road was completed. Driving "The Road" is considered to be a daunting task, and the curves in Windwardside are extremely difficult to negotiate. Driving is on the right hand side.
In 1963[citation needed] Saba residents built the Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport. This 400-metre (1,300 ft) landing strip is reputed to be the shortest commercial runway in the world,[21] and is restricted. Only trained pilots flying small STOL airliners, such as the Twin Otter and the Britten-Norman Islander may land there, as well as helicopters. Consistent air service from Sint Maarten and Sint Eustatius is available through Winair.
In 1972, a pier was completed in Fort Bay to access the island. Travel is also provided by ferry services to and from Sint Maarten with the Dawn II and The Edge.
Of note are 800 steps carved from stone that reach from Ladder Bay to the settlement known as The Bottom. Until the late 20th century, everything that was brought to the island was carried up by hand using these steps. The steps are now often used by tourists who wish to experience an intense climb.
Cultural[edit]
Main article: Culture of Saba
Saba's houses have a cottage look with red roofs. The lifestyle is slow and old-fashioned with little nightlife, even with the emergence of an ecotourism industry in the last few decades. Sabans are proud of their history of environmental conservation, calling Saba "The Unspoiled Queen."
Saban women continue to make two traditional island products, Saba Lace and Saba Spice. Saba Lace is handstitched lace, which the island's women began making in the late 19th century and built into a thriving mail-order business with the United States. Saba Spice is a rum drink, brewed with a combination of spices.
As in other Caribbean locations, Sabans throw an annual Carnival. Saba's Carnival takes place the last week in July and includes parades, steel bands, competitions, and food.
Another event held in the capital The Bottom is 'Saba Day'. This is the national day of the island in which all offices, schools and stores are closed. The island celebrates its diversity and culture through various activities and parades. The Bottom holds host to a concert at the sports field where local and other Caribbean artists come to perform.
Sports[edit]
Only a few sports are played on Saba, including volleyball (the Saba Volleyball Association is a member of NORCECA) and basketball.

Etymology[edit]
The origin of the name "Saba" comes from the Arabic word Sabha, meaning the Biblical kingdom of Sheba.[citation needed]
Energy[edit]
Like many Caribbean islands, Saba is highly dependent on fossil fuels imports, which leaves it vulnerable to global oil price fluctuations that directly impact the cost of electricity.[6] Current electricity supply depends entirely on one diesel power plant located close to sea level by the harbour and it is estimated that fifty per cent of the cost of electricity is related to the price of fossil fuels and lubricants.[7] According to a report by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), the Government of Saba made the decision to transform the island to 100% sustainable energy to eventually eliminate dependence on fossil fuel-generated electricity. This new energy policy is defined by the ‘Social development plan 2014–2020’ and ‘Saba's energy sector strategy’. Intermediate targets are 20% renewable electricity by 2017 and 40% by 2020.[7]
History[edit]
Christopher Columbus is said to have sighted the island on 13 November 1493. He did not land, being deterred by the island's perilous rocky shores. In 1632, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen landed upon Saba. They stated they found the island uninhabited when they were rescued, however, clear evidence has been found indicating that Caribs and Arawak Native Nations have lived on the island.
In 1635, a stray Frenchman claimed Saba for Louis XIII of France. In the latter 1630s, the Dutch Governor of the neighboring island of Sint Eustatius sent several Dutch families over to colonize the island for the Dutch West India Company. In 1664, refusing to swear allegiance to the English crown, these original Dutch settlers were evicted to St. Maarten by Thomas Morgan and other English pirates that had been convicted to stay on Jamaica, to return within the months and years following. The Netherlands have been in continuous possession of Saba since 1816, after numerous flag changes (British-Dutch-French) during the previous centuries.[citation needed] By 2016 the island had been French for 12 years, English for 18 years and Dutch for 345 years.
In the 17th and 18th centuries Saba's major industries were sugar, indigo and rum produced on plantations owned by Dutchmen living on St Eustatius, and later fishing, particularly lobster fishing. In the 17th century Saba was believed to be a favorable hideout for Jamaican pirates. England also deported its "undesirable" people to live in the Caribbean colonies, and some of them also became pirates, a few taking haven on Saba. The island of Saba is forbidding and steep, a natural fortress, and so the island became a private sanctuary for the families of smugglers and pirates. The most notable native Saban pirate was Hiram Beakes, who famously quipped, "Dead men tell no tales".[citation needed]
Later, legitimate sailing and trade became important, and many of the island's men took to the sea, during which time "Saba lace", which is pulled thread work, a Spanish form of needlework introduced by a nun from Venezuela, became an important product made by the island's women. Throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century, the primary source of revenue for the island came from the lacework produced by the women. During this period of time, with most of the island's men gone out to sea, the island became known as "The Island of Women".[8]
The remains of the settlements of 1630–40 can be found on the west side at Tent Bay. These settlements were destroyed by a landslide in the 17th century.
A status referendum was held in Saba on 5 November 2004. 86.05% of the population voted for closer links to the Netherlands.

Geography and ecology[edit]




Map of Saba from the Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West-Indië 1914-1917.






Saba island as viewed from the north, with Mount Scenery's peak in the clouds.


Saba consists largely of the potentially active volcano Mount Scenery. At 887 metres (2,910 ft) the volcano is the highest point within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
The vegetation of Saba is mainly composed of woodland forest with ferns and damp soil, and many mango trees. Visitors refer to Saba's forests as "the Elfin Forest" because of its high altitude mist, and mossy appearance. A woodland reserve was created and named "Elfin Forest Reserve". Saba's lush plant and animal wildlife is diverse and is cared for by the Saba Conservation Foundation.
There used to be forests of Mountain Mahogany trees until a hurricane in the 1960s destroyed many of the trees, which are Freziera undulata in the family Theaceae. Despite the common name, these trees are not related to other Mahogany species. One species of true mahogany tree is found planted on the island at lower levels, and that is the small-leaved mahogany Swietenia mahagoni, Meliaceae. The native mahogany trees are considered to be at risk of becoming extinct on Saba.
4.3 kilometres (2.7 mi) southwest of Saba is the edge of the Saba Bank, a very large submerged atoll with especially rich biodiversity. Saba Bank is the top of a sea mount and it is a prime fishing ground, particularly for lobster.

Another event held in the capital The Bottom is 'Saba Day'. This is the national day of the island in which all offices, schools and stores are closed. The island celebrates its diversity and culture through various activities and parades. The Bottom holds host to a concert at the sports field where local and other Caribbean artists come to perform.
Sports[edit]
Only a few sports are played on Saba, including volleyball (the Saba Volleyball Association is a member of NORCECA) and basketball.

Saba (/ˈsɑːbə/; Dutch pronunciation: [ˈsaːbɑ])[4] is a Caribbean island and the smallest special municipality (officially public body) of the Netherlands.[5] It consists largely of the potentially active volcano Mount Scenery, at 887 metres (2,910 ft) the highest point of the entire Netherlands.
Saba has a land area of 13 square kilometres (5.0 sq mi). As of January 2013[update], the population was 1,991 inhabitants, with a population density of 150 inhabitants per square kilometre (390/sq mi).[1] Its towns and major settlements are The Bottom (the capital), Windwardside, Hell's Gate and St. Johns.

Etymology[edit]
The origin of the name "Saba" comes from the Arabic word Sabha, meaning the Biblical kingdom of Sheba.[citation needed]
Energy[edit]
Like many Caribbean islands, Saba is highly dependent on fossil fuels imports, which leaves it vulnerable to global oil price fluctuations that directly impact the cost of electricity.[6] Current electricity supply depends entirely on one diesel power plant located close to sea level by the harbour and it is estimated that fifty per cent of the cost of electricity is related to the price of fossil fuels and lubricants.[7] According to a report by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), the Government of Saba made the decision to transform the island to 100% sustainable energy to eventually eliminate dependence on fossil fuel-generated electricity. This new energy policy is defined by the ‘Social development plan 2014–2020’ and ‘Saba's energy sector strategy’. Intermediate targets are 20% renewable electricity by 2017 and 40% by 2020.[7]
History[edit]
Christopher Columbus is said to have sighted the island on 13 November 1493. He did not land, being deterred by the island's perilous rocky shores. In 1632, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen landed upon Saba. They stated they found the island uninhabited when they were rescued, however, clear evidence has been found indicating that Caribs and Arawak Native Nations have lived on the island.
In 1635, a stray Frenchman claimed Saba for Louis XIII of France. In the latter 1630s, the Dutch Governor of the neighboring island of Sint Eustatius sent several Dutch families over to colonize the island for the Dutch West India Company. In 1664, refusing to swear allegiance to the English crown, these original Dutch settlers were evicted to St. Maarten by Thomas Morgan and other English pirates that had been convicted to stay on Jamaica, to return within the months and years following. The Netherlands have been in continuous possession of Saba since 1816, after numerous flag changes (British-Dutch-French) during the previous centuries.[citation needed] By 2016 the island had been French for 12 years, English for 18 years and Dutch for 345 years.
In the 17th and 18th centuries Saba's major industries were sugar, indigo and rum produced on plantations owned by Dutchmen living on St Eustatius, and later fishing, particularly lobster fishing. In the 17th century Saba was believed to be a favorable hideout for Jamaican pirates. England also deported its "undesirable" people to live in the Caribbean colonies, and some of them also became pirates, a few taking haven on Saba. The island of Saba is forbidding and steep, a natural fortress, and so the island became a private sanctuary for the families of smugglers and pirates. The most notable native Saban pirate was Hiram Beakes, who famously quipped, "Dead men tell no tales".[citation needed]
Later, legitimate sailing and trade became important, and many of the island's men took to the sea, during which time "Saba lace", which is pulled thread work, a Spanish form of needlework introduced by a nun from Venezuela, became an important product made by the island's women. Throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century, the primary source of revenue for the island came from the lacework produced by the women. During this period of time, with most of the island's men gone out to sea, the island became known as "The Island of Women".[8]
The remains of the settlements of 1630–40 can be found on the west side at Tent Bay. These settlements were destroyed by a landslide in the 17th century.
A status referendum was held in Saba on 5 November 2004. 86.05% of the population voted for closer links to the Netherlands.

Geography and ecology[edit]




Map of Saba from the Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West-Indië 1914-1917.






Saba island as viewed from the north, with Mount Scenery's peak in the clouds.


Saba consists largely of the potentially active volcano Mount Scenery. At 887 metres (2,910 ft) the volcano is the highest point within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
The vegetation of Saba is mainly composed of woodland forest with ferns and damp soil, and many mango trees. Visitors refer to Saba's forests as "the Elfin Forest" because of its high altitude mist, and mossy appearance. A woodland reserve was created and named "Elfin Forest Reserve". Saba's lush plant and animal wildlife is diverse and is cared for by the Saba Conservation Foundation.
There used to be forests of Mountain Mahogany trees until a hurricane in the 1960s destroyed many of the trees, which are Freziera undulata in the family Theaceae. Despite the common name, these trees are not related to other Mahogany species. One species of true mahogany tree is found planted on the island at lower levels, and that is the small-leaved mahogany Swietenia mahagoni, Meliaceae. The native mahogany trees are considered to be at risk of becoming extinct on Saba.
4.3 kilometres (2.7 mi) southwest of Saba is the edge of the Saba Bank, a very large submerged atoll with especially rich biodiversity. Saba Bank is the top of a sea mount and it is a prime fishing ground, particularly for lobster.
A non-governmental conservation organization, Saba Conservation Foundation, helps protect the nature and culture of the island.
Governance[edit]

Society[edit]




A typical Saba view.


The population of Saba (the Sabans) consists of 1,991 people who come from all over the world. Saba's small size has led to a fairly small number of island families, who can trace their last names back to around a half-dozen families. This means that many last names are shared around the island, the most numerous being Hassell and Johnson.
Most families are an intermixing of Dutch, English, Scottish, and African heritage. The population is also descended from the Irish who were exiled from that country after the accession of King Charles I of England in 1625. Charles exiled these Irish to the Caribbean in an effort to quell rebellion after he had forcibly procured their lands for his Scottish noble supporters.
Historically, Saba was traded among the many European nations that fought for power in the region. Slaves were also imported to work on Saba. In recent years Saba has become home to a large group of expatriates, and around 250 immigrants who are either students or teachers at the Saba University School of Medicine.
Languages[edit]
Both English and Dutch are spoken on the island and taught in schools, and both languages are official. Despite the island's Dutch affiliation, English is the principal language spoken on the island and has been used in its school system since the 19th century. English can therefore be used in communications of and to the government.[2] Saba English, a form of Virgin Islands Creole English, is the local vernacular.
Education and health[edit]
Saba is home to the Saba University School of Medicine, which was established by American expatriates in coordination with the government of the Netherlands. The school adds over 400 residents when classes are in session, and it is the prime educational attraction. A.M. Edwards Medical Center is the major provider of healthcare for local residents.
Same-sex marriage[edit]
In Saba (as in Bonaire and Sint Eustatius), marriage is open to same sex and opposite sex couples[10] following the entering in force of a law enabling also same-sex couples to marry on 10 October 2012.[11] The first same-sex marriage was performed on Saba on 4 December 2012 between a Dutch and a Venezuelan man, both residing in Aruba, where same-sex marriage is not performed.[12][13][14]
Economy[edit]
Main article: Economy of Saba
Since 2011 the U.S. dollar has been the official currency,[15] replacing the Netherlands Antillean guilder.
Agriculture on Saba is primarily livestock and vegetables, especially potatoes. Saba lace, also known as "Spanish work", is actually drawn thread work, and as of 2013[update], it is still produced on the island.
Tourism[edit]




A playground on Saba


The tourism industry now contributes more to the island's economy than any other sector. There are about 25,000 visitors each year. Saba has a number of inns, hotels, rental cottages and restaurants. Saba is known as "The Unspoiled Queen" of the Caribbean.[16] Saba is especially known for its ecotourism, having exceptional scuba diving, climbing and hiking.
The Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport offers flights to and from the nearby islands of St. Maarten and Sint Eustatius. There is also a ferry service from St. Maarten; the ferry boats "Dawn II ~ The Saba Ferry" and "The Edge" both travel to Saba three times a week. In addition, there are anchorages for private boats.[16]
About 150 species of fish have been found in Saba's waters.[17] A main draw for divers are the pinnacle dive sites, where magma pushed through the sea floor to create underwater towers of volcanic rock that start at about 300 feet (91 m) down and rise to about 85 feet (26 m) beneath the surface.[17] The waters around Saba were designated as the Saba National Marine Park in 1987, and are subject to government regulation to preserve the coral reefs and other marine life. The Saba Conservation Foundation has operated a hyperbaric chamber in case of diving emergencies, since 1991.[18]
Transport[edit]




A view of the village of Windwardside, taken from Mount Scenery.


There is one main road, known as "The Road". Its construction was masterminded by Josephus Lambert Hassell who, despite the common opinion of Dutch and Swiss engineers, believed that a road could be built.[19] He took a correspondence course in civil engineering and started building the road with a crew of locals in 1938.[20]
After five years of work the first section of the road from Fort Bay to The Bottom was completed. It was not until 1947 that the first motor vehicle arrived. In 1951 the road to Windwardside and St. Johns was opened and in 1958, the road was completed. Driving "The Road" is considered to be a daunting task, and the curves in Windwardside are extremely difficult to negotiate. Driving is on the right hand side.
In 1963[citation needed] Saba residents built the Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport. This 400-metre (1,300 ft) landing strip is reputed to be the shortest commercial runway in the world,[21] and is restricted. Only trained pilots flying small STOL airliners, such as the Twin Otter and the Britten-Norman Islander may land there, as well as helicopters. Consistent air service from Sint Maarten and Sint Eustatius is available through Winair.
In 1972, a pier was completed in Fort Bay to access the island. Travel is also provided by ferry services to and from Sint Maarten with the Dawn II and The Edge.
Of note are 800 steps carved from stone that reach from Ladder Bay to the settlement known as The Bottom. Until the late 20th century, everything that was brought to the island was carried up by hand using these steps. The steps are now often used by tourists who wish to experience an intense climb.
Cultural[edit]
Main article: Culture of Saba
Saba's houses have a cottage look with red roofs. The lifestyle is slow and old-fashioned with little nightlife, even with the emergence of an ecotourism industry in the last few decades. Sabans are proud of their history of environmental conservation, calling Saba "The Unspoiled Queen."
Saban women continue to make two traditional island products, Saba Lace and Saba Spice. Saba Lace is handstitched lace, which the island's women began making in the late 19th century and built into a thriving mail-order business with the United States. Saba Spice is a rum drink, brewed with a combination of spices.
As in other Caribbean locations, Sabans throw an annual Carnival. Saba's Carnival takes place the last week in July and includes parades, steel bands, competitions, and food.
Another event held in the capital The Bottom is 'Saba Day'. This is the national day of the island in which all offices, schools and stores are closed. The island celebrates its diversity and culture through various activities and parades. The Bottom holds host to a concert at the sports field where local and other Caribbean artists come to perform.
Sports[edit]
Only a few sports are played on Saba, including volleyball (the Saba Volleyball Association is a member of NORCECA) and basketball.

Etymology[edit]
The origin of the name "Saba" comes from the Arabic word Sabha, meaning the Biblical kingdom of Sheba.[citation needed]
Energy[edit]
Like many Caribbean islands, Saba is highly dependent on fossil fuels imports, which leaves it vulnerable to global oil price fluctuations that directly impact the cost of electricity.[6] Current electricity supply depends entirely on one diesel power plant located close to sea level by the harbour and it is estimated that fifty per cent of the cost of electricity is related to the price of fossil fuels and lubricants.[7] According to a report by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), the Government of Saba made the decision to transform the island to 100% sustainable energy to eventually eliminate dependence on fossil fuel-generated electricity. This new energy policy is defined by the ‘Social development plan 2014–2020’ and ‘Saba's energy sector strategy’. Intermediate targets are 20% renewable electricity by 2017 and 40% by 2020.[7]
History[edit]
Christopher Columbus is said to have sighted the island on 13 November 1493. He did not land, being deterred by the island's perilous rocky shores. In 1632, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen landed upon Saba. They stated they found the island uninhabited when they were rescued, however, clear evidence has been found indicating that Caribs and Arawak Native Nations have lived on the island.
In 1635, a stray Frenchman claimed Saba for Louis XIII of France. In the latter 1630s, the Dutch Governor of the neighboring island of Sint Eustatius sent several Dutch families over to colonize the island for the Dutch West India Company. In 1664, refusing to swear allegiance to the English crown, these original Dutch settlers were evicted to St. Maarten by Thomas Morgan and other English pirates that had been convicted to stay on Jamaica, to return within the months and years following. The Netherlands have been in continuous possession of Saba since 1816, after numerous flag changes (British-Dutch-French) during the previous centuries.[citation needed] By 2016 the island had been French for 12 years, English for 18 years and Dutch for 345 years.
In the 17th and 18th centuries Saba's major industries were sugar, indigo and rum produced on plantations owned by Dutchmen living on St Eustatius, and later fishing, particularly lobster fishing. In the 17th century Saba was believed to be a favorable hideout for Jamaican pirates. England also deported its "undesirable" people to live in the Caribbean colonies, and some of them also became pirates, a few taking haven on Saba. The island of Saba is forbidding and steep, a natural fortress, and so the island became a private sanctuary for the families of smugglers and pirates. The most notable native Saban pirate was Hiram Beakes, who famously quipped, "Dead men tell no tales".[citation needed]
Later, legitimate sailing and trade became important, and many of the island's men took to the sea, during which time "Saba lace", which is pulled thread work, a Spanish form of needlework introduced by a nun from Venezuela, became an important product made by the island's women. Throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century, the primary source of revenue for the island came from the lacework produced by the women. During this period of time, with most of the island's men gone out to sea, the island became known as "The Island of Women".[8]
The remains of the settlements of 1630–40 can be found on the west side at Tent Bay. These settlements were destroyed by a landslide in the 17th century.
A status referendum was held in Saba on 5 November 2004. 86.05% of the population voted for closer links to the Netherlands.

Geography and ecology[edit]




Map of Saba from the Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West-Indië 1914-1917.

Saba consists largely of the potentially active volcano Mount Scenery. At 887 metres (2,910 ft) the volcano is the highest point within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
The vegetation of Saba is mainly composed of woodland forest with ferns and damp soil, and many mango trees. Visitors refer to Saba's forests as "the Elfin Forest" because of its high altitude mist, and mossy appearance. A woodland reserve was created and named "Elfin Forest Reserve". Saba's lush plant and animal wildlife is diverse and is cared for by the Saba Conservation Foundation.
There used to be forests of Mountain Mahogany trees until a hurricane in the 1960s destroyed many of the trees, which are Freziera undulata in the family Theaceae. Despite the common name, these trees are not related to other Mahogany species. One species of true mahogany tree is found planted on the island at lower levels, and that is the small-leaved mahogany Swietenia mahagoni, Meliaceae. The native mahogany trees are considered to be at risk of becoming extinct on Saba.
4.3 kilometres (2.7 mi) southwest of Saba is the edge of the Saba Bank, a very large submerged atoll with especially rich biodiversity. Saba Bank is the top of a sea mount and it is a prime fishing ground, particularly for lobster.
A non-governmental conservation organization, Saba Conservation Foundation, helps protect the nature and culture of the island.
Governance[edit]

Saba became a special municipality within the country of the Netherlands after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles on 10 October 2010.[9]
The head of the island is the Island Governor, current held by Jonathan G. A. Johnson.
Previous title holders include:

John Hassell
Charles Simmons
Edward Beaks
Richard Johnson
Moses Leverock
Henry Every
Wycliffe Smith
Sydney Sorton

Society[edit]




A typical Saba view.


The population of Saba (the Sabans) consists of 1,991 people who come from all over the world. Saba's small size has led to a fairly small number of island families, who can trace their last names back to around a half-dozen families. This means that many last names are shared around the island, the most numerous being Hassell and Johnson.
Most families are an intermixing of Dutch, English, Scottish, and African heritage. The population is also descended from the Irish who were exiled from that country after the accession of King Charles I of England in 1625. Charles exiled these Irish to the Caribbean in an effort to quell rebellion after he had forcibly procured their lands for his Scottish noble supporters.
Historically, Saba was traded among the many European nations that fought for power in the region. Slaves were also imported to work on Saba. In recent years Saba has become home to a large group of expatriates, and around 250 immigrants who are either students or teachers at the Saba University School of Medicine.
Languages[edit]
Both English and Dutch are spoken on the island and taught in schools, and both languages are official. Despite the island's Dutch affiliation, English is the principal language spoken on the island and has been used in its school system since the 19th century. English can therefore be used in communications of and to the government.[2] Saba English, a form of Virgin Islands Creole English, is the local vernacular.
Education and health[edit]
Saba is home to the Saba University School of Medicine, which was established by American expatriates in coordination with the government of the Netherlands. The school adds over 400 residents when classes are in session, and it is the prime educational attraction. A.M. Edwards Medical Center is the major provider of healthcare for local residents.
Same-sex marriage[edit]
In Saba (as in Bonaire and Sint Eustatius), marriage is open to same sex and opposite sex couples[10] following the entering in force of a law enabling also same-sex couples to marry on 10 October 2012.[11] The first same-sex marriage was performed on Saba on 4 December 2012 between a Dutch and a Venezuelan man, both residing in Aruba, where same-sex marriage is not performed.[12][13][14]
Economy[edit]
Main article: Economy of Saba
Since 2011 the U.S. dollar has been the official currency,[15] replacing the Netherlands Antillean guilder.
Agriculture on Saba is primarily livestock and vegetables, especially potatoes. Saba lace, also known as "Spanish work", is actually drawn thread work, and as of 2013[update], it is still produced on the island.
Tourism[edit]




A playground on Saba


The tourism industry now contributes more to the island's economy than any other sector. There are about 25,000 visitors each year. Saba has a number of inns, hotels, rental cottages and restaurants. Saba is known as "The Unspoiled Queen" of the Caribbean.[16] Saba is especially known for its ecotourism, having exceptional scuba diving, climbing and hiking.
The Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport offers flights to and from the nearby islands of St. Maarten and Sint Eustatius. There is also a ferry service from St. Maarten; the ferry boats "Dawn II ~ The Saba Ferry" and "The Edge" both travel to Saba three times a week. In addition, there are anchorages for private boats.[16]
About 150 species of fish have been found in Saba's waters.[17] A main draw for divers are the pinnacle dive sites, where magma pushed through the sea floor to create underwater towers of volcanic rock that start at about 300 feet (91 m) down and rise to about 85 feet (26 m) beneath the surface.[17] The waters around Saba were designated as the Saba National Marine Park in 1987, and are subject to government regulation to preserve the coral reefs and other marine life. The Saba Conservation Foundation has operated a hyperbaric chamber in case of diving emergencies, since 1991.[18]
Transport[edit]




A view of the village of Windwardside, taken from Mount Scenery.


There is one main road, known as "The Road". Its construction was masterminded by Josephus Lambert Hassell who, despite the common opinion of Dutch and Swiss engineers, believed that a road could be built.[19] He took a correspondence course in civil engineering and started building the road with a crew of locals in 1938.[20]
After five years of work the first section of the road from Fort Bay to The Bottom was completed. It was not until 1947 that the first motor vehicle arrived. In 1951 the road to Windwardside and St. Johns was opened and in 1958, the road was completed. Driving "The Road" is considered to be a daunting task, and the curves in Windwardside are extremely difficult to negotiate. Driving is on the right hand side.
In 1963[citation needed] Saba residents built the Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport. This 400-metre (1,300 ft) landing strip is reputed to be the shortest commercial runway in the world,[21] and is restricted. Only trained pilots flying small STOL airliners, such as the Twin Otter and the Britten-Norman Islander may land there, as well as helicopters. Consistent air service from Sint Maarten and Sint Eustatius is available through Winair.
In 1972, a pier was completed in Fort Bay to access the island. Travel is also provided by ferry services to and from Sint Maarten with the Dawn II and The Edge.
Of note are 800 steps carved from stone that reach from Ladder Bay to the settlement known as The Bottom. Until the late 20th century, everything that was brought to the island was carried up by hand using these steps. The steps are now often used by tourists who wish to experience an intense climb.
Cultural[edit]
Main article: Culture of Saba
Saba's houses have a cottage look with red roofs. The lifestyle is slow and old-fashioned with little nightlife, even with the emergence of an ecotourism industry in the last few decades. Sabans are proud of their history of environmental conservation, calling Saba "The Unspoiled Queen."
Saban women continue to make two traditional island products, Saba Lace and Saba Spice. Saba Lace is handstitched lace, which the island's women began making in the late 19th century and built into a thriving mail-order business with the United States. Saba Spice is a rum drink, brewed with a combination of spices.
As in other Caribbean locations, Sabans throw an annual Carnival. Saba's Carnival takes place the last week in July and includes parades, steel bands, competitions, and food.
Another event held in the capital The Bottom is 'Saba Day'. This is the national day of the island in which all offices, schools and stores are closed. The island celebrates its diversity and culture through various activities and parades. The Bottom holds host to a concert at the sports field where local and other Caribbean artists come to perform.
Sports[edit]
Only a few sports are played on Saba, including volleyball (the Saba Volleyball Association is a member of NORCECA) and basketball.

In 1664, refusing to swear allegiance to the English crown, these original Dutch settlers were evicted to St. Maarten by Thomas Morgan and other English pirates that had been convicted to stay on Jamaica, to return within the months and years following. The Netherlands have been in continuous possession of Saba since 1816, after numerous flag changes (British-Dutch-French) during the previous centuries.[citation needed] By 2016 the island had been French for 12 years, English for 18 years and Dutch for 345 years.
In the 17th and 18th centuries Saba's major industries were sugar, indigo and rum produced on plantations owned by Dutchmen living on St Eustatius, and later fishing, particularly lobster fishing. In the 17th century Saba was believed to be a favorable hideout for Jamaican pirates. England also deported its "undesirable" people to live in the Caribbean colonies, and some of them also became pirates, a few taking haven on Saba. The island of Saba is forbidding and steep, a natural fortress, and so the island became a private sanctuary for the families of smugglers and pirates. The most notable native Saban pirate was Hiram Beakes, who famously quipped, "Dead men tell no tales".[citation needed]
Later, legitimate sailing and trade became important, and many of the island's men took to the sea, during which time "Saba lace", which is pulled thread work, a Spanish form of needlework introduced by a nun from Venezuela, became an important product made by the island's women. Throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century, the primary source of revenue for the island came from the lacework produced by the women. During this period of time, with most of the island's men gone out to sea, the island became known as "The Island of Women".[8]
The remains of the settlements of 1630–40 can be found on the west side at Tent Bay. These settlements were destroyed by a landslide in the 17th century.
A status referendum was held in Saba on 5 November 2004. 86.05% of the population voted for closer links to the Netherlands.

Geography and ecology[edit]

Saba consists largely of the potentially active volcano Mount Scenery. At 887 metres (2,910 ft) the volcano is the highest point within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
The vegetation of Saba is mainly composed of woodland forest with ferns and damp soil, and many mango trees. Visitors refer to Saba's forests as "the Elfin Forest" because of its high altitude mist, and mossy appearance. A woodland reserve was created and named "Elfin Forest Reserve". Saba's lush plant and animal wildlife is diverse and is cared for by the Saba Conservation Foundation.
There used to be forests of Mountain Mahogany trees until a hurricane in the 1960s destroyed many of the trees, which are Freziera undulata in the family Theaceae. Despite the common name, these trees are not related to other Mahogany species. One species of true mahogany tree is found planted on the island at lower levels, and that is the small-leaved mahogany Swietenia mahagoni, Meliaceae. The native mahogany trees are considered to be at risk of becoming extinct on Saba.
4.3 kilometres (2.7 mi) southwest of Saba is the edge of the Saba Bank, a very large submerged atoll with especially rich biodiversity. Saba Bank is the top of a sea mount and it is a prime fishing ground, particularly for lobster.
A non-governmental conservation organization, Saba Conservation Foundation, helps protect the nature and culture of the island.
Governance[edit]

Society[edit]




A typical Saba view.


The population of Saba (the Sabans) consists of 1,991 people who come from all over the world. Saba's small size has led to a fairly small number of island families, who can trace their last names back to around a half-dozen families. This means that many last names are shared around the island, the most numerous being Hassell and Johnson.
Most families are an intermixing of Dutch, English, Scottish, and African heritage. The population is also descended from the Irish who were exiled from that country after the accession of King Charles I of England in 1625. Charles exiled these Irish to the Caribbean in an effort to quell rebellion after he had forcibly procured their lands for his Scottish noble supporters.
Historically, Saba was traded among the many European nations that fought for power in the region. Slaves were also imported to work on Saba. In recent years Saba has become home to a large group of expatriates, and around 250 immigrants who are either students or teachers at the Saba University School of Medicine.
Languages[edit]
Both English and Dutch are spoken on the island and taught in schools, and both languages are official. Despite the island's Dutch affiliation, English is the principal language spoken on the island and has been used in its school system since the 19th century. English can therefore be used in communications of and to the government.[2] Saba English, a form of Virgin Islands Creole English, is the local vernacular.
Education and health[edit]
Saba is home to the Saba University School of Medicine, which was established by American expatriates in coordination with the government of the Netherlands. The school adds over 400 residents when classes are in session, and it is the prime educational attraction. A.M. Edwards Medical Center is the major provider of healthcare for local residents.
Same-sex marriage[edit]
In Saba (as in Bonaire and Sint Eustatius), marriage is open to same sex and opposite sex couples[10] following the entering in force of a law enabling also same-sex couples to marry on 10 October 2012.[11] The first same-sex marriage was performed on Saba on 4 December 2012 between a Dutch and a Venezuelan man, both residing in Aruba, where same-sex marriage is not performed.[12][13][14]
Economy[edit]
Main article: Economy of Saba
Since 2011 the U.S. dollar has been the official currency,[15] replacing the Netherlands Antillean guilder.
Agriculture on Saba is primarily livestock and vegetables, especially potatoes. Saba lace, also known as "Spanish work", is actually drawn thread work, and as of 2013[update], it is still produced on the island.
Tourism[edit]




A playground on Saba


The tourism industry now contributes more to the island's economy than any other sector. There are about 25,000 visitors each year. Saba has a number of inns, hotels, rental cottages and restaurants. Saba is known as "The Unspoiled Queen" of the Caribbean.[16] Saba is especially known for its ecotourism, having exceptional scuba diving, climbing and hiking.
The Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport offers flights to and from the nearby islands of St. Maarten and Sint Eustatius. There is also a ferry service from St. Maarten; the ferry boats "Dawn II ~ The Saba Ferry" and "The Edge" both travel to Saba three times a week. In addition, there are anchorages for private boats.[16]
About 150 species of fish have been found in Saba's waters.[17] A main draw for divers are the pinnacle dive sites, where magma pushed through the sea floor to create underwater towers of volcanic rock that start at about 300 feet (91 m) down and rise to about 85 feet (26 m) beneath the surface.[17] The waters around Saba were designated as the Saba National Marine Park in 1987, and are subject to government regulation to preserve the coral reefs and other marine life. The Saba Conservation Foundation has operated a hyperbaric chamber in case of diving emergencies, since 1991.[18]
Transport[edit]




A view of the village of Windwardside, taken from Mount Scenery.


There is one main road, known as "The Road". Its construction was masterminded by Josephus Lambert Hassell who, despite the common opinion of Dutch and Swiss engineers, believed that a road could be built.[19] He took a correspondence course in civil engineering and started building the road with a crew of locals in 1938.[20]
After five years of work the first section of the road from Fort Bay to The Bottom was completed. It was not until 1947 that the first motor vehicle arrived. In 1951 the road to Windwardside and St. Johns was opened and in 1958, the road was completed. Driving "The Road" is considered to be a daunting task, and the curves in Windwardside are extremely difficult to negotiate. Driving is on the right hand side.
In 1963[citation needed] Saba residents built the Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport. This 400-metre (1,300 ft) landing strip is reputed to be the shortest commercial runway in the world,[21] and is restricted. Only trained pilots flying small STOL airliners, such as the Twin Otter and the Britten-Norman Islander may land there, as well as helicopters. Consistent air service from Sint Maarten and Sint Eustatius is available through Winair.
In 1972, a pier was completed in Fort Bay to access the island. Travel is also provided by ferry services to and from Sint Maarten with the Dawn II and The Edge.
Of note are 800 steps carved from stone that reach from Ladder Bay to the settlement known as The Bottom. Until the late 20th century, everything that was brought to the island was carried up by hand using these steps. The steps are now often used by tourists who wish to experience an intense climb.
Cultural[edit]
Main article: Culture of Saba
Saba's houses have a cottage look with red roofs. The lifestyle is slow and old-fashioned with little nightlife, even with the emergence of an ecotourism industry in the last few decades. Sabans are proud of their history of environmental conservation, calling Saba "The Unspoiled Queen."
Saban women continue to make two traditional island products, Saba Lace and Saba Spice. Saba Lace is handstitched lace, which the island's women began making in the late 19th century and built into a thriving mail-order business with the United States. Saba Spice is a rum drink, brewed with a combination of spices.
As in other Caribbean locations, Sabans throw an annual Carnival. Saba's Carnival takes place the last week in July and includes parades, steel bands, competitions, and food.
Another event held in the capital The Bottom is 'Saba Day'. This is the national day of the island in which all offices, schools and stores are closed. The island celebrates its diversity and culture through various activities and parades. The Bottom holds host to a concert at the sports field where local and other Caribbean artists come to perform.
Sports[edit]
Only a few sports are played on Saba, including volleyball (the Saba Volleyball Association is a member of NORCECA) and basketball.

Etymology[edit]
The origin of the name "Saba" comes from the Arabic word Sabha, meaning the Biblical kingdom of Sheba.[citation needed]
Energy[edit]
Like many Caribbean islands, Saba is highly dependent on fossil fuels imports, which leaves it vulnerable to global oil price fluctuations that directly impact the cost of electricity.[6] Current electricity supply depends entirely on one diesel power plant located close to sea level by the harbour and it is estimated that fifty per cent of the cost of electricity is related to the price of fossil fuels and lubricants.[7] According to a report by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), the Government of Saba made the decision to transform the island to 100% sustainable energy to eventually eliminate dependence on fossil fuel-generated electricity. This new energy policy is defined by the ‘Social development plan 2014–2020’ and ‘Saba's energy sector strategy’. Intermediate targets are 20% renewable electricity by 2017 and 40% by 2020.[7]
History[edit]
Christopher Columbus is said to have sighted the island on 13 November 1493. He did not land, being deterred by the island's perilous rocky shores. In 1632, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen landed upon Saba. They stated they found the island uninhabited when they were rescued, however, clear evidence has been found indicating that Caribs and Arawak Native Nations have lived on the island.
In 1635, a stray Frenchman claimed Saba for Louis XIII of France. In the latter 1630s, the Dutch Governor of the neighboring island of Sint Eustatius sent several Dutch families over to colonize the island for the Dutch West India Company. In 1664, refusing to swear allegiance to the English crown, these original Dutch settlers were evicted to St. Maarten by Thomas Morgan and other English pirates that had been convicted to stay on Jamaica, to return within the months and years following. The Netherlands have been in continuous possession of Saba since 1816, after numerous flag changes (British-Dutch-French) during the previous centuries.[citation needed] By 2016 the island had been French for 12 years, English for 18 years and Dutch for 345 years.
In the 17th and 18th centuries Saba's major industries were sugar, indigo and rum produced on plantations owned by Dutchmen living on St Eustatius, and later fishing, particularly lobster fishing. In the 17th century Saba was believed to be a favorable hideout for Jamaican pirates. England also deported its "undesirable" people to live in the Caribbean colonies, and some of them also became pirates, a few taking haven on Saba. The island of Saba is forbidding and steep, a natural fortress, and so the island became a private sanctuary for the families of smugglers and pirates. The most notable native Saban pirate was Hiram Beakes, who famously quipped, "Dead men tell no tales".[citation needed]
Later, legitimate sailing and trade became important, and many of the island's men took to the sea, during which time "Saba lace", which is pulled thread work, a Spanish form of needlework introduced by a nun from Venezuela, became an important product made by the island's women. Throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century, the primary source of revenue for the island came from the lacework produced by the women. During this period of time, with most of the island's men gone out to sea, the island became known as "The Island of Women".[8]
The remains of the settlements of 1630–40 can be found on the west side at Tent Bay. These settlements were destroyed by a landslide in the 17th century.
A status referendum was held in Saba on 5 November 2004. 86.05% of the population voted for closer links to the Netherlands.

About 150 species of fish have been found in Saba's waters.[17] A main draw for divers are the pinnacle dive sites, where magma pushed through the sea floor to create underwater towers of volcanic rock that start at about 300 feet (91 m) down and rise to about 85 feet (26 m) beneath the surface.[17] The waters around Saba were designated as the Saba National Marine Park in 1987, and are subject to government regulation to preserve the coral reefs and other marine life. The Saba Conservation Foundation has operated a hyperbaric chamber in case of diving emergencies, since 1991.[18]
Transport[edit]




A view of the village of Windwardside, taken from Mount Scenery.


There is one main road, known as "The Road". Its construction was masterminded by Josephus Lambert Hassell who, despite the common opinion of Dutch and Swiss engineers, believed that a road could be built.[19] He took a correspondence course in civil engineering and started building the road with a crew of locals in 1938.[20]
After five years of work the first section of the road from Fort Bay to The Bottom was completed. It was not until 1947 that the first motor vehicle arrived. In 1951 the road to Windwardside and St. Johns was opened and in 1958, the road was completed. Driving "The Road" is considered to be a daunting task, and the curves in Windwardside are extremely difficult to negotiate. Driving is on the right hand side.
In 1963[citation needed] Saba residents built the Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport. This 400-metre (1,300 ft) landing strip is reputed to be the shortest commercial runway in the world,[21] and is restricted. Only trained pilots flying small STOL airliners, such as the Twin Otter and the Britten-Norman Islander may land there, as well as helicopters. Consistent air service from Sint Maarten and Sint Eustatius is available through Winair.
In 1972, a pier was completed in Fort Bay to access the island. Travel is also provided by ferry services to and from Sint Maarten with the Dawn II and The Edge.
Of note are 800 steps carved from stone that reach from Ladder Bay to the settlement known as The Bottom. Until the late 20th century, everything that was brought to the island was carried up by hand using these steps. The steps are now often used by tourists who wish to experience an intense climb.
Cultural[edit]
Main article: Culture of Saba
Saba's houses have a cottage look with red roofs. The lifestyle is slow and old-fashioned with little nightlife, even with the emergence of an ecotourism industry in the last few decades. Sabans are proud of their history of environmental conservation, calling Saba "The Unspoiled Queen."
Saban women continue to make two traditional island products, Saba Lace and Saba Spice. Saba Lace is handstitched lace, which the island's women began making in the late 19th century and built into a thriving mail-order business with the United States. Saba Spice is a rum drink, brewed with a combination of spices.
As in other Caribbean locations, Sabans throw an annual Carnival. Saba's Carnival takes place the last week in July and includes parades, steel bands, competitions, and food.
Another event held in the capital The Bottom is 'Saba Day'. This is the national day of the island in which all offices, schools and stores are closed. The island celebrates its diversity and culture through various activities and parades. The Bottom holds host to a concert at the sports field where local and other Caribbean artists come to perform.
Sports[edit]
Only a few sports are played on Saba, including volleyball (the Saba Volleyball Association is a member of NORCECA) and basketball.

Alabama Is Rolling in Cash, With Tide Lifting All Boats
Over the past decade, the success of Alabama’s football program has become a powerful engine for the university’s economic and academic growth.

By JOE DRAPENOV. 5, 2015

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Bill Battle is near the 30-yard line with his fellow alumni, gripping hands and flashing a lighthouse smile, reassuring one and all that all is right in the University of Alabama athletics department, which he runs. Near the edge of the field, Molly Brautigan and fellow sorority sisters laugh and plot their postgame festivities.At midfield, with his back to the visiting Arkansas Razorbacks, a stone-faced Nick Saban — Alabama’s $7-million-a-year football coach — watches his team tick off its warm-up drills surrounded by a rising tide of crimson as the more than 101,000 faithful find their seats at Bryant-Denny Stadium.Jim Carabin, the general manager of Crimson Tide Sports Marketing, is on the sideline, too. He hands a signed football to people from Golden Flake, “the official potato chip of the Crimson Tide for more than 50 years,” and programs to AT&T and Coca-Cola representatives before racing out of a tunnel to check on his broadcast team.The athletic director and the salesman, the football coach and the sorority sister, have all taken their places for what, at least seven Saturdays here each year, becomes the center of the Alabama universe: game day. It is equal parts war on the field and worship service, and it serves as the centerpiece of Alabama Football Inc., an enterprise that generates more than $95 million annually.

Its football prowess is well established, going back to 1926, when the Crimson Tide became the first Southern team to win the Rose Bowl, and continuing with the powerhouse 1960s and ’70s teams coached by the legendary Paul Bryant, known as Bear, and Saban’s current run of three national titles in the past six years, with a realistic shot at a fourth this season.

But over the past decade, the success of Crimson Tide football can be measured off the field as well, as it has become a powerful engine for the university’s economic and academic growth, a standout among other large public universities with a similar zest for capitalizing on their sports programs.Alabama’s football pre-eminence on television and in the postseason, along with an aggressive plan to extend the university reach beyond the state, has helped attract a more academically-minded student body in the past decade from all over the country and served as the catalyst for more than $1.7 billion in fund-raising, according to those who have engineered the explosive growth.

In the last decade, enrollment has increased by more than 55 percent, to a record 37,100 students this fall, and more than half of the students now are from out of state, another seismic shift. The acceptance rate in the last decade fell to 54 percent, from 72 percent. This year, 2,261 freshmen are enrolled in its Honors College, two and half times the number 10 years ago. Its 174 National Merit and National Achievement finalists rank Alabama among the top five public universities.“Just like Nick Saban has recruited five-star athletes, the university is going after the best and brightest students,” said Calvin Brown, Alabama’s director of alumni affairs. “We understand that there are young people out there who first view us, or any other institution, through the window of athletics.”As it grows, skeptics, many outside the university, question how much of the financial juggernaut makes its way to the classroom, and scoff at what they see as an imbalance of spending on facilities for athletes instead of regular students.Dr. Allen Sack, professor emeritus at the University of New Haven and a member of the Drake Group, which pushes for educational improvements in college athletics, says that while big football universities claim that money is flowing to the classroom, it is often difficult to verify, though the wealth usually means there is some benefit.“They are competing at the top level for tens of millions of network and marketing dollars,” Sack said. “Where is that money going? How much of it is going into laboratories and academics? Is it enhancing the reputation of the university? Nobody really knows those answers.”

Alabama has funneled some of its largess into millions of dollars in scholarships and faculty salaries, with pledges to do more as it essentially monetizes the passion for the sport and embeds it in the university’s DNA.A Business-Minded Athletic DepartmentIn one of the earliest known examples of the power of product placement, each episode of “The Bear Bryant Show” on Sundays began with Bryant twisting off the cap of a Coke bottle and opening a bag of Golden Flake chips, a nod to the sponsors bringing his thoughts on the previous day’s game into living rooms across Alabama.No one embodies this dynamic as neatly as Bill Battle, Alabama’s athletic director since 2013. He played on Bryant’s 1961 national championship team and then lined up across the field from the Bear as the coach of the University of Tennessee. In 1970, when Battle took that job, he was 28 and the youngest head coach in the nation.Despite compiling a 59–22–2 record and winning four of five bowl games, he was forced out by Tennessee after the 1976 season, partly because the Volunteers could not supplant Bryant and Alabama as a Southeastern Conference power, partly to make way for Johnny Majors, a Tennessee alumnus who had just led Pittsburgh to a national championship. Bryant may have helped run Battle out of coaching, but he pushed him into business in a big way.In 1981, while Battle ran a company selling aluminum windows, Bryant told him that he was unhappy with the company managing his speaking engagements and was looking for some help lining up better ones. Bryant sat on the board of Battle’s window company, and they had developed a friendship, so Battle agreed to assume the role himself.As he immersed himself in the business of college sports and the branding of the Bear, Battle discovered that the University of Alabama did not have a licensing department (nor did any other college football power), which meant that its distinctive symbol, the script “A,” and “Roll Tide!” logos could be appropriated and slapped on shirts, hats or coffee cups without the university receiving a dime.

“I knew how important universities are to communities and alumni,” Battle said. “Those markings, the school brand, were worth a lot of money, and they were leaving it on the table.”Battle also knew to steal the playbook for licensing and selling merchandise from the N.F.L., which had in turn taken a page from the Walt Disney Company’s book. With Alabama as his first client, Battle created the Collegiate Licensing Company.

Thirty-four years later, the collegiate merchandise market takes in $4.6 billion in annual sales. In 2007, IMG, the global sports management conglomerate, bought Battle’s company, along with access to his 200 clients, for a reported price of more than $100 million. And licensing remains a healthy revenue stream for Alabama; under its current contract, CLC guaranteed Alabama $9 million this year and $103 million through the 2024-25 season.Battle, 73, still answers to the name Coach and works the stadium suites with the power and grace of the tight end he once was, popping in and out of them talking football, betraying a grimace when Alabama, trailing Arkansas by 7-3, wastes opportunities to score before halftime. He considers himself a caretaker of a beloved brand — one with 31,000 people on the waiting list for season tickets and plenty of companies and donors waiting to ante up a mid-six-figure donation to secure a luxury suite.Battle says Mal Moore, his predecessor and former Alabama teammate, deserves the credit for laying the foundation for this efficient money machine. In 2003, the athletic budget was $37 million. Today it is $153 million. It was Moore who launched and presided over the $285 million in new athletic facilities, including two expansions to Bryant-Denny Stadium that brought the seating to 101,821. Moore also lured Saban from the N.F.L.’s Miami Dolphins with a professional-size paycheck.“It was a brilliant move,” Battle said.Robert Witt, who was the president at the time of Saban’s hiring and is now the chancellor, called the move the university’s wisest investment. After he was hired, the campus surpassed a $50 million capital improvement campaign by $52 million, and he has been a key to reaching a $500 million campaign for the university at large.Just as licensing of logos 35 years ago was considered found money, the rapidly increasing revenue from broadcast rights because of the popularity of college sports has been a boon to Battle’s department, especially the 2014 launch of the SEC Network, a joint venture between the conference and ESPN.Last year, the SEC received $436.8 million, $31.2 million per university, for broadcast rights and bowl game and College Football Playoff payouts, as well as money generated from the conference and the N.C.A.A. basketball championships. That was up from $292.8 million, $20.9 million per university, the previous year.And a robust top line has paid off with championships beyond football. Since 2008, Crimson Tide programs have won nine national championships in five sports and 20 SEC titles in seven sports.Still, some remain troubled by the big money being poured into college football and the breaks the game has received from lawmakers and the Internal Revenue Service.

“All of this operates under the broad umbrella of the university’s tax-exempt status as an educational institution,” said Gilbert M. Gaul, the author of “Billion Dollar Ball: A Journey Through the Big-Money Culture of College Football.” “That may have made sense once upon a time, but I don’t see how a highly commercialized football business qualifies as a tax-exempt institution today. We lose about $500 million annually on the tax breaks awarded football and other revenue-generating sports.”

Gaul also points to the expenses Alabama has incurred as Saban has built an N.F.L.-style program. Kirby Smart, the Crimson Tide’s defensive coordinator, is the second-highest-paid assistant in the nation, with a salary of $1.5 million.“The 10 full-time football coaches alone account for about half of all of the money available for the 60 Alabama coaches,” Gaul said.

Yet between the strides in enrollment and academics and the athletic department’s contributions back to the university, Battle says, his department has not received any pushback from the university faculty or alumni.“We’re not the tail wagging the dog,” he said.Faculty members agreed.“There’s less of a ‘Let’s get athletics’ among our faculty than most places,” said Dr. K. Clark Midkiff, a professor of mechanical engineering here for 30 years and a former president of the faculty senate. “I think what they are doing with athletics is reasonable and proper. Yes, winning three national champions was a nice bump, but it isn’t the dominant reason for our growth. We had a vision as an institution, and a lot of people worked hard to make it work.”Last year, the athletic department recorded a $33 million profit, according to university documents. It gave $9.1 million to the university, including $4 million for the university’s Presidential Scholarships, which go to top-performing students. Since 2010, athletics have also provided $1 million annually toward faculty salaries. The biggest line item in the budget is $16 million to pay for more than 300 scholarships at full price.The student-athletes have helped their cause as well by posting an overall cumulative grade-point average of 3.03 and a graduation rate of 71 percent, 5 percentage points better than the rate for the regular student body. Last year’s football team was recognized as one of the nation’s top academic programs, ranking third in the annual academic rankings of the top 25 college football teams, produced by New America, a Washington think tank.Gaul, however, said he found that Alabama and football powers like it spent millions on academic centers and tutors for athletes — resources often not available for the rest of the student body. “They treat football players a heck of a lot better than they do the kids in the Honors College,” he said.Selling the Alabama BrandWith less than three minutes left to play, Derrick Henry bulled his way over the goal line for a touchdown, setting off an emphatic celebration at Bryant-Denny. The Crimson Tide had shaken off their early sluggishness and scored 24 points in the final 17 minutes to defeat the Razorbacks, 27-14.

Coach Saban had done his job. Jim Carabin was still doing his.He was here at 8 a.m., 11 hours before kickoff, making sure that his sponsors’ village had been set up in the shadow of the stadium and that the suite inside had been properly stocked with everything from gulf shrimp chowder and hot dogs to roast beef and chicken. There were also tickets to hand off and a production meeting to attend for the radio broadcast.Learfield Sports guarantees Alabama up to $14 million a year in revenue as the multimedia rights holder, and it sells items like programs; game-day radio headsets; and scoreboard, online and radio ads.Carabin and his nine-member staff are responsible for turning the typical game-day program into a glossy, 175-plus-page, sponsor-driven tome that sells 17,000 copies at $5 a pop. They program more than 1,000 hours of radio broadcasts annually, including nine hours alone each football Saturday, that are carried on 62 stations from Aniston, Ala., to West Point, Ga.; Apalachicola, Fla., to Tupelo, Miss.

Each Thursday, they are in town at Bob’s Victory Grille, where “Hey Coach,” a 90-minute weekly call-in show where the Crimson Tide faithful will bid up to $2,900 for the right to sit at the table in front, ask the coach the first question, get memorabilia signed and get a photo with Saban.It is an easy sale, right?“It’s such a big and iconic brand that expectations are so much higher,” Carabin said. “It’s no longer ‘I want an ad in the program and four season tickets.’ Everyone wants to own something unique.”So Crimson Tide Marketing gives it to them. Eli Gold, the voice of Alabama football, peppers his play-by-play with the “Bromberg Jewelers Rolex Scoring” recap and teases to the “Full Moon Bar-B-Que Halftime Report.” Pitches for Lilly Forklift lead into promotions for Baumhower’s Restaurant, “Home of Legendary Food, Legendary Fun.”Inside Bryant-Denny, the bigger regional and national sponsors own the scoreboards. Regions bank and Toyota pay $80,000 to have their logos rotate down the left side throughout the game. Muscle Milk and Coca-Cola pay six figures to own the tunnels and corner boards. Anywhere from $50,000 to $75,000 buys one minute of pregame ads and two minutes of in-game ads on the LED scroll and attracts companies like Cooper Tires and restaurants like Billy’s Sports Bar.It is well past 9 p.m. now as Saban makes his way through the bowels of the stadium to meet the media. Carabin is there. Afterward, he will take Saban to a studio in the stadium to film his weekly television show. It will be another late but lucrative night of Alabama football.

Cameras are trained at the podium awaiting Saban’s arrival. Earlier, Carabin bemoaned the lack of an LED board behind the coach. Just think how valuable that real estate would be to sponsors, he lamented later.“I could sell it three times,” he said, smiling.Instead, awaiting the coach on the podium is a Coca-Cola; in Saban’s hand, as he walks in, is a bottle of Dasani water, both part of the sponsor deal.

The New Student ClassLive oak trees yawn over the perfectly coifed quadrangles that are lined by stately brick buildings fronted by columns and graced with domes and turrets from another era. When Stuart Bell arrived on campus over the summer as Alabama’s new president, it was as familiar to him as it was the day he left in 2002 to become dean at the University of Kansas School of Engineering.“There always has been a feeling here that once we got kids to step foot on our campus, we will keep them here,” said Bell, who most recently was executive vice president and provost at Louisiana State. “Little has changed, and a lot has changed.”The College of Engineering, where Bell spent 16 years as a professor and administrator, has four new buildings on a quad named after Senator Richard Shelby, an alumnus, and his wife, Annette, who is a professor emerita here. Six residential communities with 2.1 million square feet and more than 5,000 beds are new as well.


            Record Enrollment in 2015        

            The University of Alabama has 37,100* students in 2015, the most in its history. Nearly half of them are from Alabama, and about 16.5 percent are from the contiguous states of Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee.

It is who is inside them, however, that impresses Bell the most — young men and women from New York to Washington State, Hawaii to Maine. Some are the product of the hard work put in by members of Alabama’s more than 110 alumni chapters, which have aggressively recruited potential students and helped endow more than $40 million in scholarships. Alabama’s price tag is attractive as well: $10,170 for residents and $25,950 for out-of-state students, a bargain compared with the nearly $40,000 charged at elite public universities.Alabama, where Gov. George Wallace made his famous Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in 1963 to unsuccessfully block integration, has struggled to ensure that the rocketing enrollment is diverse: 81.6 percent of enrolled students in 2015 are white, and 85.4 percent of newly enrolled freshmen are white. Those figures have actually increased since 2010.Many newcomers are like Molly Brautigan, 18, who says Saban and his football team brought her south from Montclair, N.J. She wanted to spend Saturday mornings like this one — trying on and discarding outfits — for a brunch date at the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house. She wanted to tailgate in the afternoons in the quad, tent-hopping among the young men in blue blazers and pink button-down Oxfords while dressed to the nines with her Pi Beta Phi pledge sisters.

“I wanted to attend a big Southern school with big football, big Greek life and warm weather,” she said as sunshine poured down on the quad and cold beers found their way into hands.

She was accepted at South Carolina, Clemson, Georgia and L.S.U. but chose Alabama to pursue a finance degree because she thought the academics here were as strong as the social scene.She is hardly alone. Wesley Goodlett and Connor Sparks are Texans who transferred here — Goodlett from the University of Texas, Sparks from Texas Tech. Emily Bradley, a sophomore from Michigan, received a scholarship to Alabama’s Honors College and chose it over joining her brother at Michigan State. “I love football, so it was a good fit,” Bradley said.Mindy Brautigan, Molly’s mother, is a New Jersey native who graduated from Villanova, near Philadelphia. At first, she was mystified by her daughter’s determination to go south. “Molly wanted to reinvent herself, and as soon as she stepped on campus, she knew that was where she wanted to be,” she said.Mindy Brautigan understood why after attending the Ole Miss game earlier in the season.
