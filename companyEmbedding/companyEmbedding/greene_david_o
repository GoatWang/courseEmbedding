The mural will be up through October. Curious if Goldman Properties will keep the security detail on it until then.

By the way

Overview



Make sure to check out (http://thetuttlemathpsm.com/). davidgreene39@gmail.com is where I can be reached. My next book, "So You Think You Can Gamble, on Sports" (which will be pertaining to the "Big-3" of sports gambling); is now available. These booklets, are just that; in the fact that they will only be between 90 to 115 pages in length, always. Hence the low price, even though there's plenty of wording (12,104 in this booklet), and it certainly packs a punch! Although, this book was written with all football bettor's in mind; its teachings are a bit advanced for the Beginner/Novice. The Avid/Advanced football bettor, will absolutely LOVE IT!! The "systems" discussed in this book are absolutely years ahead of their time!
