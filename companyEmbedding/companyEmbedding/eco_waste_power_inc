Portable Restrooms  


Eco Waste Services can provide any number of portable toilets, hand wash sinks, and holding tanks for construction job sites and special events. Whether the portable toilets are utilized on a construction site or at a special event, having an adequate number of clean and well-serviced portable restrooms is very important.
Portable Sanitation Products
We have the following types of portable restrooms and associated products available: 

Regular portable toilet, with or without sinks  suitable for any type of use.
Flushing portable toilet, with or without sinks  suitable for any type of use, including special events.
ADA portable toilet  single unit which is fully wheelchair accessible.
Hand sanitizer dispenser  an option on any portable toilet.
Hand wash station  a stand-alone sink option.
250 gallon holding tanks  typically used when water is available but no sewer tap is available with office trailers, RVs, kitchen trailers, restroom trailers, and laundry trailers. Tanks can be hooked together for higher capacity. Both fresh water and sewer holding tanks are available. 
Portable Restroom Features 
All of our portable restrooms have the following standard amenities included: 

Large doors for ease of entrance and exit

Locks on the interior of the door for safety and privacy
We have the capability to provide service to portable restroom units for any size or event.
