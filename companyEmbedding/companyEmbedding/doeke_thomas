Notes:
				
Significance: The Thomas Coke By-product Works is possibly the finest intact early twentieth century by-product coke works available for interpretation.  The construction of the Koppers-Becker coke ovens at Thomas in 1925 marked the end in the process to convert from beehive coking ovens to by-product recover coking in the Birmingham Industrial District.  Thus, the site represents the modern method of extracting by-products from the coking process and using them to make industrial chemicals such as coal gas, tar, ammonia, light oil and naphthalene.  The coke was used to fuel the Thomas Company's blast furnaces.

If Digital Images Are Displaying
You can download online images yourself.  Alternatively, you can purchase copies of various types through Library of Congress Duplication Services.
HABS/HAER/HALS materials have generally been scanned at high resolution that is suitable for most publication purposes (see Digitizing the Collection for further details about the digital images).


Photographs--All photographs are printed from digital files to preserve the fragile originals.


Make note of the Call Number and Item Number that appear under the photograph in the multiple-image display (e.g., HAER, NY,52-BRIG,4-2).

If possible, include a printout of the photograph.



Drawings--All drawings are printed from digital files to preserve the fragile originals.


Make note of the Survey Number (e.g., HAER NY - 143) and Sheet Number (e.g., "Sheet 1 of 4"), which appear on the edge of the drawing. (NOTE: These numbers are visible in the Tiff "Reference Image" display.)

If possible, include a printout of the drawing. 



Data Pages


Make note of the Call Number in the catalog record.



If Digital Images Are Not Displaying
In the rare case that a digital image for HABS/HAER/HALS documentation is not displaying online, select images for reproduction through one of these methods:


Visit the Prints & Photographs Reading Room and request to view the group (general information about service in the reading room is available at: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/info/001_ref.html). It is best to contact reference staff in advance (see: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/address.html) to make sure the material is on site.  OR


P&P reading room staff can provide up to 15 quick copies of items per calendar year (many original items in the holdings are too old or fragile to make such copies, but generally HABS/HAER/HALS materials are in good enough condition to be placed on photocopy machines). For assistance, see our Ask a Librarian page OR


Hire a freelance researcher to do further selection for you (a list of researchers in available at: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/resource/013_pic.html).


You can purchase copies of various types, including quick copies, through Library of Congress Duplication Services (price lists, contact information, and order forms for Library of Congress Duplication Services are available on the Duplication Services Web site):


Make note of the Call Number listed above. 

Look at the Medium field above. If it lists more than one item: 


The entire group can be ordered as photocopies or high-quality copies. 

All the items in a particular medium (e.g., all drawings, all photographs) can be ordered as photocopies or high-quality copies.

	Please use the following steps to determine whether you need to 
	fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room 
	to view the original item(s).   In some cases, a surrogate 
	(substitute image) is available, often in the form of a digital 
	image, a copy print, or microfilm.




Is the item digitized? (A thumbnail (small) image will 
		be visible on the left.)



Yes, the item is digitized.
					Please use the digital image in preference to requesting 
					the original. All images can be viewed at a large size 
					when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress.  
					In some cases, only thumbnail (small) images are available 
					when you are outside the Library of Congress because the 
					item is rights restricted or has not been evaluated for 
					rights restrictions. 
				

					As a preservation measure, we generally do not serve an 
					original item when a digital image is available.  If you 
					have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with 
					a reference librarian.  (Sometimes, the original is simply 
					too fragile to serve. For example, glass and film photographic 
					negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also 
					easier to see online where they are presented as positive 
					images.) 
				



No, the item is not digitized.
					Please go to #2.





Do the Access Advisory or Call Number fields above indicate that 
		a non-digital surrogate exists, such as microfilm or copy prints?



Yes, another surrogate exists.
					Reference staff can direct you to this surrogate.
				



No, another surrogate does not exist.
					Please go to #3.






			If you do not see a thumbnail image or a reference to another 
			surrogate, please fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs 
			Reading Room. In many cases, the originals can be served in a 
			few minutes. Other materials require appointments for later the 
			same day or in the future.  Reference staff can advise you in 
			both how to fill out a call slip and when the item can be served. 
		



To contact Reference staff in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room, 
please use our Ask A Librarian service or 
call the reading room between 8:30 and 5:00 at 202-707-6394, and Press 3.
