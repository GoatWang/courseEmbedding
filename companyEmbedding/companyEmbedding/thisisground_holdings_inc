Privacy Policy





This Privacy Policy was last updated on February 17, 2017.
Welcome to the This Is Ground website (including all subdomains, the âSiteâ), which is operated by This Is Ground Management, LLC and its affiliates (collectively, âThis Is Ground,â âweâ, âusâ and/or âourâ). This Site provides, among other things, information about our people, organization and application process, tools for applicants to submit applications and go through the application process, forums for discussions about topics relevant to startups, and profiles of founders and companies who have participated in the This Is Ground program. This Privacy Policy sets forth This Is Groundâs policy with respect to personally identifiable data (âPersonal Dataâ) and certain other information that is collected from users of the Site.

Information We Collect:
When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:
Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, register an account with us or submit an application to us.
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to us, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of This Is Ground and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.
Other Information:
Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with This Is Ground through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. This Is Ground may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by This Is Ground affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the characteristics of businesses that apply to or are accepted by This Is Ground, and we may publish or otherwise disclose such aggregated information.
Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Site, This Is Ground may conduct research on the characteristics of such users, including but not limited to user demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and This Is Ground may publish or otherwise disclose such aggregated information. This aggregate information does not identify you personally.
Analytics and Tracking Technologies: We may, and we may allow third party service providers to, use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Site. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (âGoogleâ). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Site. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
On most web browsers, you will find a âhelpâ section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Siteâs features.
Our Site currently does not respond to âDo Not Trackâ (DNT) signals and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.

Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:
This Is Ground uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided or for other This Is Ground-related purposes. For instance (but without limitation):

If you provide Personal Data in order to create a username and profile, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such those components of the Site that require a username (including the This Is Ground application process and news.thisisground.com), to administer your access to the Site (e.g., sending a replacement password to the email address you provided to us) and to monitor your use of the Site.
If you provide Personal Data to attend an event, we will use your Personal Data to give you access to that event and track the attendees of the event.
If you are an investor and are signing up to attend a Demo Day, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Data and other information that we will use to manage and administer your participation in Demo Day-related activities (e.g., collecting and ranking your likes, scheduling meetings with companies, etc.).

This Is Ground may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us manage and administer the Site (e.g., to moderate forums, detect or prevent vote fraud, etc.), improve the Site, better understand our users and improve the This Is Ground program. Please note that when we refer to your username in this Privacy Policy, such username may be your Hacker News ID or another username that you are permitted to create in connection with the Site, depending on the circumstances.
This Is Ground Applications: If you submit an application to This Is Ground, please carefully read our Applications Privacy Policy.. In the event of any conflict between the Applications Privacy Policy and any other portion of this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, the Applications Privacy Policy will control.

Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:
In addition to the disclosures described above, there are certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
Business Transfers: In the event of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
Related Companies: This Is Ground is comprised of a variety of entities, and we may share your Personal Data with those various entities for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Agents, Contractors and Other Third Parties: This Is Ground, like many businesses, sometimes hires others to perform certain functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information and maintaining databases. When we employ or engage others to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function under appropriate confidentiality obligations.
Legal Requirements: This Is Ground may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of This Is Ground or individuals associated with This Is Ground, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

Your Profile:
If you create a username for the Site, please also note that your username, how long ago you created your account, your karma, and any information included in the âAboutâ field in your profile (including stories, favorites, comments associated with your username and any information you include in that field) will be viewable by the public in your publicly accessible profile page. Please note that we have no obligation to delete any of stories, favorites or comments listed in your profile or otherwise remove their association with your profile or username.

Your Choices:
You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain components of the Site.

Exclusions:
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by This Is Ground other than Personal Data collected through the Site. In addition, this Privacy Policy shall not apply to any information that we do not directly solicit from you that you provide to This Is Ground through the Site or through any other means.

All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and This Is Ground shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. The Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by This Is Ground (the âThird Party Sitesâ). The policies and procedures we describe here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Site do not imply that This Is Ground endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.

This Is Ground takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Site may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to This Is Ground via the Internet.

In addition, certain components of the Site (e.g., applications to This Is Ground) may have additional sub-policies that apply to such components of the Site, and we will provide such sub-policies within the user interface for such components.

Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

 Agreement to Arbitrate

This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Use as the âArbitration Agreement.â You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and This Is Ground, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof), the Site, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Use, you and This Is Ground are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief

YOU AND This Is Ground AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND This Is Ground AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSONâS OR PARTYâS CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTYâS INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).

 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution

This Is Ground is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the userâs satisfaction by emailing us at info@thisisground.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (âNoticeâ). The Notice to This Is Ground should be sent to This Is Ground Management, LLC, 335 Pioneer Way, Mountain View, CA 94041 Attention General Counsel (âNotice Addressâ). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If This Is Ground and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or This Is Ground may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by This Is Ground or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or This Is Ground is entitled.

 Arbitration Procedures

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associationâs (âAAAâ) rules and procedures (collectively, the âAAA Rulesâ), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Use and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
Unless This Is Ground and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, This Is Ground agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

 Costs of Arbitration

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the âArbitration Feesâ) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.

 Confidentiality

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

 Severability

If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled âProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Reliefâ above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled âProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Reliefâ are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms of Use will continue to apply.

 Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement

Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Use to the contrary, This Is Ground agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Site, you may reject any such change by sending This Is Ground written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).

Termination
You agree that This Is Ground, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Site and remove and discard any content within the Site, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if This Is Ground believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Site, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. This Is Ground may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Site, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Site under any provision of this Terms of Use may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that This Is Ground may (but has obligation to) immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Site. Termination of your account or access to any component of the Site will not terminate This Is Groundâs rights to your User Content. Further, you agree that This Is Ground will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Site.

User Disputes
You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Site and This Is Ground will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. This Is Ground reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Site.

General
These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and This Is Ground and govern your use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements between you and This Is Ground with respect to the Site. These Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and This Is Ground agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. The failure of This Is Ground to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the partiesâ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Use without the prior written consent of This Is Ground, but This Is Ground may assign or transfer this Terms of Use, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Site may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Use or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Site.
