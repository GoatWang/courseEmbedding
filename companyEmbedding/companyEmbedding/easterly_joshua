            Property Description
    


Welcome to Joshua Cove: With over 2.5 million visitors traveling to Joshua Tree to visit the National Park in 2016 alone, surging interest has failed to keep abreast with housing demand. Large price-per-square-foot increases on recent residential sales near this parcel indicate continuing strong market conditions. Combined parcels total approximately 8 acres, with ingress and egress, providing a rare opportunity for an aesthetically pleasing and environmentally friendly housing development to merge organically with the neighborhood. Unobstructed views of rock outcroppings across the wash add substantial value to this location within walking distance of the Village.  Utilities nearby. Incredible value for broad minded investor interested in developing much needed housing for Joshua Tree's next generation. Seller will consider carrying with 60% down payment, or trade for already developed property. This property could also be used for a large private estate, or two large houses on the separate 4ac parcels and two smaller homes on the other parcels, without any subdivision required. Many possibilities and alternatives for this unique investment.

Welcome to Joshua Cove: With over 2.5 million visitors traveling to Joshua Tree to visit the National Park in 2016 alone, surging interest has failed to keep abreast with housing demand. Large price-per-square-foot increases on recent residential sales near this parcel indicate continuing strong market conditions. Combined parcels total approximately 8 acres, with ingress and egress, providing a rare opportunity for an aesthetically pleasing and environmentally friendly housing development to merge organically with the neighborhood. Unobstructed views of rock outcroppings across the wash add substantial value to this location within walking distance of the Village. Utilities nearby. Incredible value for broad minded investor interested in developing much needed housing for Joshua Trees next generation. Seller will consider carrying with 60% down payment, or trade for already developed property. This property could also be used for a large private estate, or two large houses on the separate 4ac parcels and two smaller homes on the other parcels, without any subdivision required. Many possibilities and alternatives for this unique investment.

Welcome to Joshua Cove: With over 2.5 million visitors traveling to Joshua Tree to visit the National Park in 2016 alone, surging interest has failed to keep abreast with housing demand. Large price-per-square-foot increases on recent residential sales near this parcel indicate continuing strong market conditions. Combined parcels total approximately 8 acres, with ingress and egress, providing a rare opportunity for an aesthetically pleasing and environmentally friendly housing development to merge organically with the neighborhood. Unobstructed views of rock outcroppings across the wash add substantial value to this location within walking distance of the Village. Utilities nearby. Incredible value for broad minded investor interested in developing much needed housing for Joshua Trees next generation. Seller will consider carrying with 60% down payment, or trade for already developed property. This property could also be used for a large private estate, or two large houses on the separate 4ac parcels and two smaller homes on the other parcels, without any subdivision required. Many possibilities and alternatives for this unique investment.
