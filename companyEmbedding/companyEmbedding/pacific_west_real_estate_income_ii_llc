Company Overview

.......................................................................................................................................................................................... 


With  an experienced eye and a disciplined, mathematical approach, Pacific West Land  researches, analyzes, and invests in real estate across the United States.  Comparing  real estate values across different regions, Pacific West Land identifies  inefficiencies as real estate markets react to economic cycles and respond to  changes in local conditions. This translates to an ability to change with the  times, adapting investment strategies as new opportunities occur. 
 
Pacific West Land employs a  low-leverage approach, taking a patient and structured approach toward  maximizing value.  Starting in 1981, previous strategies include purchasing and zoning  land for sale, developing residential and commercial properties, and acquiring  and repositioning distressed commercial assets.   We have acquired and managed over 100 properties located in markets such  as Southern California, Denver, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Atlanta, and Florida.
Pacific West Land is both a fund sponsor and a real estate  operator.  We provide in-house capital  management, acquisitions, and asset management services.  We are able to avoid a layer of overhead that  is incurred when the fund sponsor is separate from the property owner.  Avoiding such duplication increases the  probability of delivering higher net returns to investors.

            Pacific West Land works only with accredited and institutional investors.  We  believe in a personal approach to each investor’s needs, and reach out through  investor meetings, events, and substantial reporting throughout the year to  make sure every investor is well-informed and comfortable.  We welcome visitors at any time, and pride  ourselves on being accessible to our investors.
To make our interests align with our investors, we personally  invest our own capital in each venture.

Pacific Life refers to Pacific Life Insurance Company and its affiliates, including Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Insurance products are issued by Pacific Life Insurance Company in all states except New York and in New York by Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Product availability and features may vary by state. Each insurance company is solely responsible for the financial obligations accruing under the products it issues. Insurance products and their guarantees, including optional benefits and any crediting rates, are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company, but they do not protect the value of the variable investment options. Look to the strength of the life insurance company with regard to such guarantees as these guarantees are not backed by the broker-dealer, insurance agency or their affiliates from which products are purchased. Neither these entities nor their representatives make any representation or assurance regarding the claims-paying ability of the life insurance company. Variable insurance products are distributed by Pacific Select Distributors, LLC (member FINRA & SIPC), a subsidiary of Pacific Life Insurance Company and an affiliate of Pacific Life & Annuity Company, and are available through licensed third-party broker-dealers.

Pacific Life is a product provider. It is not a fiduciary and therefore does not give advice or make recommendations regarding insurance or investment products. Only a life insurance producer who is also a fiduciary is required to advise if the product purchase and any subsequent action taken with regard to the product are in their client’s best interest.

Pacific Life’s Home Office is located in Newport Beach, CA.

Portfolio Holdings was established in 1993 to exploit cyclical opportunities in the UK commercial real estate market. Its acquisition strategy primarily focused on portfolios, significant single assets and landmark properties, development, refurbishment and management opportunities. The business joint ventured with financial partners including Apollo Real Estate, GE Capital Corporation, Deutsche Bank, Pelham Partners and Goldman Sachs’ Whitehall Fund.

The investment generated an IRR of 35% and 3.2 x equity multiple.

The Fund invested €754 million in eleven commercial real estate transactions in Paris. Investors received an IRR of 22% and 1.7 x equity multiple.









































 PROPERTY MEZZANINE PARTNERS

Property Mezzanine Partners was established and launched in 1995 with, amongst others, Electra Partners. The Fund provided mezzanine finance for investment into commercial real estate, most notably in Manchester’s landmark building, Piccadilly Plaza. The Fund executed transactions with a total value of £178 million generating an IRR of 23% and 1.8 x equity multiple.




















Pacific and York

In the years post the 2008 credit crunch, the UK housing market saw major volatility as a result of the banking crisis.
  Property prices were driven markedly downwards in parallel with market confidence.
  Against this backdrop, in early 2010 Pacific formed a new company, Pacific and York, to acquire blocks of newly built apartments at significant discounts to their open market value.
  These apartments were let on AST's generating double digit yields. After a holding period of 5 years, the units along with their freeholds were sold either as a block to institutional investor or as individual units in the open market.




















Pacific Investments Asia

  Pacific Investments Asia is a joint venture established to invest in real estate opportunities in South East Asia. It developed distribution warehouse near Bangkok, Thailand for Unilever under a long-term lease and at 45,000m² this was the largest such warehouse in South East Asia at the time of its development. A second 60,000 m² warehouse was completed and leased to Unilever in 2014.













Trinity River Developments

  As a results of the Celtic Tiger that hit Ireland in 2007, Pacific identified an opportunity in 2011 to buy distressed residential land in Dublin at heavily discounted prices with a view to building houses.
  Being the first major acquirers of land after the crash enabled Pacific along with it's JV partner Starwood Capital to acquire 3 sites covering 8 acres, all with various planning outlines.
  The strong rebound in land and house values meant that all 3 sites were sold off before development began, generating an IRR in excess of 80%.





















Red River USA

  In 2011 Pacific started Red River USA LP, a partnership designed to acquire single family houses from foreclosure auction sites in the suburbs of Miami, USA.
  Overall 30 homes were purchased and subsequently refurbished and once tenanted generated double digit yields.
  The houses were held for 2 to 3 years and gradually sold off after significant capital appreciation.








Lennox Gardens

 In 2011 Pacific Investments simultaneously acquired five off market apartments in Lennox Gardens with the vision of creating one stunning triple lateral apartment in excess of 5000 sq ft in arguably one of London’s most desirable addresses. The project took over 2 years involving complex license negotiations with three different freeholders, the enfranchisement of two of the apartments, multiple planning applications, extensive discussions with listed building control and meticulous attention to the overall build quality and finish. The result is a beautiful apartment with phenomenal entertaining space valued in the region £25 million. Pacific decided to hold the asset, refinance and rent out on a two-year term for £15,000 per week reflecting a market leading 3.1% gross yield. The development margin equates to circa 60% profit on cost providing a projected gross profit on exit in the region of £10 million. Tristan Parker and Penna Property Partners worked alongside Pacific Investments to help achieve the above.




















Gatti House, The Strand

 In 2013 Pacific Investments and Penna Property Partners entered into a joint venture with Enstar Capital to acquire 410 Strand, London WC2. The Grade 2 listed building had previously been home to an amusement arcade with a language school on the upper parts. Planning consent was obtained to convert the building into 4 magnificent apartments in excess of 5250 sq ft with A3 usage on the ground floor pre-let to Byron Burger. Further planning gain of an additional 20% was subsequently achieved along with approval for 89 non material amendments enhancing the layout of the units and scheme as a whole. The design required enormous imagination given the existing floor plates and Grade 2 listing however the final scheme used this to our advantage by creating a mixture of unique apartments in both classic and soft contemporary styles. The apartments were sold during the first half of 2015 achieving record prices for the Strand despite a cooling market. The deal provided a profit on cost of 61% delivering a return on equity of 117% and an IRR of 40%.
