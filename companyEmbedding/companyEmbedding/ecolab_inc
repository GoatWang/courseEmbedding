History[edit]
Early years : 1923 - 1950s[edit]
Merritt J. "M.J." Osborn founded Economics Laboratory in 1923 with the tagline "Saving time, lightening labor and reducing costs to those we serve." The company's original product was Absorbit, a product designed to quickly clean carpets in hotel rooms. This was soon followed by Soilax, a dishwasher soap. During the 1930s, the company expanded throughout the United States and sales reached US$5.4 million by the end of 1940s. It acquired the Magnus Company in the early 1950s, which gave the company access to Magnus's industrial specialty businesses - including pulp and paper, metalworking, transportation, and petrochemical processing.[2]
Transition to a public corporation and expansion: 1950s - 1986[edit]
In the 1950s, international expansion of Economics Laboratory started, with the establishment of its first overseas subsidiary in Sweden in 1956. It became a publicly traded corporation in 1957,[2] and continued to expand during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1979, it acquired Apollo Technologies, but in 1983 the acquired Apollo subsidiary was shut down.
Ecolab Inc.: 1986 - present[edit]




Ecolab's headquarters in Saint Paul, Minnesota


In 1986 the company changed its name from Economics Laboratory to Ecolab Inc.
In 1987, Ecolab purchased the lawncare servicer provider ChemLawn for US$376 million. It sold the acquisition in 1992 to ServiceMaster for US$103 million as it couldn't turn ChemLawn into a profitable business.[2] Ecolab and the German fast-moving consumer goods firm Henkel KGaA formed a 50:50 European joint venture called 'Henkel-Ecolab' in mid-1991 to expand into European/Russian markets.[4]
Ecolab would continue to acquire companies in the 1990s, namely Kay Chemical (1993), Australia-based Gibson Chemical Industries Ltd (1997), and GCS Service Inc (1998). In 2001 it bought out its partner Henkel's 50% stake in the European joint venture, Henkel-Ecolab. Ecolab integrated the former Henkel-Ecolab into its existing global operations. As a legacy of the Henkel-Ecolab cooperation from 1991–2001, Henkel continued to hold a 29.5% stake in Ecolab Inc. after the sale of the joint venture.[4]
In the mid-2000s, strategic acquisitions continued, and Ecolab diversified its portfolio of customer offerings by venturing into the food safety management business as well as a healthcare business unit. In 2005, it opened a new global research, development, and engineering center in Eagan, Minnesota.[5]
In 2008, Henkel sold all of the 73 million shares, i.e., nearly a 29.5% stake it held in Ecolab, ending the two-decade-long partnership.[6][7][8] The same year, Ecolab established Zurich as its Europe, the Middle East and Africa headquarters.[5]
In 2010, Ecolab was ranked #365 in Fortune 500 magazine, and in 2011 Ecolab was named one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies" by the Ethisphere Institute.[9]
In July 2011, Ecolab announced a merger with Nalco Holding Company, Inc., and in December 2011 Nalco became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ecolab Inc. after it completed its US$5.4 billion acquisition.[10][11][12][13]
In May 2012, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, through his investment vehicles—Cascade Investment and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation—increased his stake of 10.8% in Ecolab to 25%.[14][15][16]
In October 2012, Ecolab entered an agreement to acquire Champion Technologies.[17] That purchase closed in April 2013.[18]
In November 2015, for $40.5 million Ecolab acquired the U.S. operations of Charlotte, N.C.-based Swisher Hygiene which provides hygiene and sanitizing solutions for the foodservice, hospitality, retail and healthcare markets. [19] [20]
In July 2016, Ecolab made a minority equity investment in Aquatech International, LLC of an undisclosed amount. [21] [22]
Operations[edit]
Ecolab employs approximately 47,000 people, and operates in more than 170 countries. It is organized in the following geographical divisions:

North America (based in St. Paul, Minnesota)
Europe (based in Zurich, Switzerland)
Middle East and Africa
Asia Pacific
Greater China
Latin America
South Africa

Products and services[edit]
Ecolab provides water, hygiene and energy technologies and services to the food, energy, healthcare, industrial and hospitality markets.[23][24]
The company's food safety services provide consulting to restaurants, hospitals, food retailers and food & beverage manufacturing facilities. It is also a supplier of chemicals used by beef and poultry processors - to reduce pathogens, such as E. coli and salmonella - in uncooked beef and poultry.

History[edit]
Early years : 1923 - 1950s[edit]
Merritt J. "M.J." Osborn founded Economics Laboratory in 1923 with the tagline "Saving time, lightening labor and reducing costs to those we serve." The company's original product was Absorbit, a product designed to quickly clean carpets in hotel rooms. This was soon followed by Soilax, a dishwasher soap. During the 1930s, the company expanded throughout the United States and sales reached US$5.4 million by the end of 1940s. It acquired the Magnus Company in the early 1950s, which gave the company access to Magnus's industrial specialty businesses - including pulp and paper, metalworking, transportation, and petrochemical processing.[2]
Transition to a public corporation and expansion: 1950s - 1986[edit]
In the 1950s, international expansion of Economics Laboratory started, with the establishment of its first overseas subsidiary in Sweden in 1956. It became a publicly traded corporation in 1957,[2] and continued to expand during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1979, it acquired Apollo Technologies, but in 1983 the acquired Apollo subsidiary was shut down.
Ecolab Inc.: 1986 - present[edit]




Ecolab's headquarters in Saint Paul, Minnesota


In 1986 the company changed its name from Economics Laboratory to Ecolab Inc.
In 1987, Ecolab purchased the lawncare servicer provider ChemLawn for US$376 million. It sold the acquisition in 1992 to ServiceMaster for US$103 million as it couldn't turn ChemLawn into a profitable business.[2] Ecolab and the German fast-moving consumer goods firm Henkel KGaA formed a 50:50 European joint venture called 'Henkel-Ecolab' in mid-1991 to expand into European/Russian markets.[4]
Ecolab would continue to acquire companies in the 1990s, namely Kay Chemical (1993), Australia-based Gibson Chemical Industries Ltd (1997), and GCS Service Inc (1998). In 2001 it bought out its partner Henkel's 50% stake in the European joint venture, Henkel-Ecolab. Ecolab integrated the former Henkel-Ecolab into its existing global operations. As a legacy of the Henkel-Ecolab cooperation from 1991–2001, Henkel continued to hold a 29.5% stake in Ecolab Inc. after the sale of the joint venture.[4]
In the mid-2000s, strategic acquisitions continued, and Ecolab diversified its portfolio of customer offerings by venturing into the food safety management business as well as a healthcare business unit. In 2005, it opened a new global research, development, and engineering center in Eagan, Minnesota.[5]
In 2008, Henkel sold all of the 73 million shares, i.e., nearly a 29.5% stake it held in Ecolab, ending the two-decade-long partnership.[6][7][8] The same year, Ecolab established Zurich as its Europe, the Middle East and Africa headquarters.[5]
In 2010, Ecolab was ranked #365 in Fortune 500 magazine, and in 2011 Ecolab was named one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies" by the Ethisphere Institute.[9]
In July 2011, Ecolab announced a merger with Nalco Holding Company, Inc., and in December 2011 Nalco became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ecolab Inc. after it completed its US$5.4 billion acquisition.[10][11][12][13]
In May 2012, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, through his investment vehicles—Cascade Investment and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation—increased his stake of 10.8% in Ecolab to 25%.[14][15][16]
In October 2012, Ecolab entered an agreement to acquire Champion Technologies.[17] That purchase closed in April 2013.[18]
In November 2015, for $40.5 million Ecolab acquired the U.S. operations of Charlotte, N.C.-based Swisher Hygiene which provides hygiene and sanitizing solutions for the foodservice, hospitality, retail and healthcare markets. [19] [20]
In July 2016, Ecolab made a minority equity investment in Aquatech International, LLC of an undisclosed amount. [21] [22]
Operations[edit]
Ecolab employs approximately 47,000 people, and operates in more than 170 countries. It is organized in the following geographical divisions:

North America (based in St. Paul, Minnesota)
Europe (based in Zurich, Switzerland)
Middle East and Africa
Asia Pacific
Greater China
Latin America
South Africa

Products and services[edit]
Ecolab provides water, hygiene and energy technologies and services to the food, energy, healthcare, industrial and hospitality markets.[23][24]
The company's food safety services provide consulting to restaurants, hospitals, food retailers and food & beverage manufacturing facilities. It is also a supplier of chemicals used by beef and poultry processors - to reduce pathogens, such as E. coli and salmonella - in uncooked beef and poultry.

EL acquires Klenzade and its pioneering Clean-in-Place (CIP) technology for the dairy industry. CIP eliminates the need to break down and hand wash dairy pipes and valves.

        1970 – International Growth
        
International sales exceed $30 million in 40 world markets. EL establishes a European satellite headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to guide efforts in 15 countries. In 1977, area headquarters are set up in Latin America and Hawaii. By the end of the decade, EL conducts business in more than 50 countries. 



        1981 – Solid Power® Introduced
        
 EL introduces Solid Power®, a patented state-of-the-art warewashing detergent capsule that delivers unprecedented control, safety and cost-savings to customers. Sales soar and within two years of its introduction, Solid Power is the top-selling institutional warewashing detergent in the U.S.

        1986 – Ecolab Inc. on the NYSE
        
In December, Economics Laboratory Inc. changes its name to Ecolab Inc., providing a simple and unifying worldwide identification. That month, Ecolab is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, enhancing the company’s standing in the investment community and heightening investor interest. 



        1987 – Consumer Sale
        
Ecolab sells its consumer products business, which markets household products including dishwasher detergents Electrosol and Finish, Jet Dry and Lime Away. Ecolab then acquires ChemLawn, a provider of residential lawn care services. The business is sold in 1992 to enable Ecolab to focus completely on its commercial product and service businesses. Continued on next page In 1986, Economics Laboratory Inc. changed its name to Ecolab Inc., providing a unifying world identification.
Milestones in Ecolab History (continued) 






1923-1957



        1923 – Economics Laboratory Founded
        
Merritt J. Osborn develops a new product, Absorbit®, which cleans carpets on the spot and eliminates the need for hotels to shut down to be cleaned. He calls his company Economics Laboratory (EL), reflecting its mission to save customers time, labor and money with “economic” solutions developed through “laboratory” research. 



        1924 – A Warewashing Pioneer
        
M.J. Osborn incorporates the company and acquires a non-sudsing cleaning compound from a chemistry student. He soon discovers that it works much better than ordinary soap in the mechanical dishwashers that restaurants are starting to use. Called Soilax®, this product sets the stage for EL’s warewashing expertise. 



        1928 – Total Systems Approach
        
EL introduces its first product dispenser, setting the stage for a “total systems” approach to cleaning and sanitation, which includes technologically advanced equipment, as well as superior products. 



        1935 – Service Tradition Begins
        
M.J. Osborn’s son, E.B., serving the company as sales manager, turns its sales people into dishwashing consultants who not only sell EL products, but also repair and maintain customers’ dishwashers, train kitchen employees, analyze dish-handling procedures and recommend ways to minimize breakage. They are on call 24 hours a day.



        1955 – International Expansion
        
By 1955, there is enough business in Canada to form a sales territory and to contract with a Canadian manufacturer to handle production. In 1956, the first European subsidiary, Soilax® A.B. Sweden, forms, opening the door for expansion in Europe. The formation of Soilax® de Mexico follows in 1958, triggering a rapid expansion in the Western Hemisphere. 



        1957 – EL Goes Public
        
M.J. and E.B. Osborn decide to turn their family-owned business into a publicly held company. At the time, associates control at least 25 percent of the company’s common stock. Continued on next page From the beginning, our company has focused on saving customers time, labor and money.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.
