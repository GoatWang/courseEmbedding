ABOUT




As a designer Annette Meyer is working with a wide range of activities in the field of fashion, exhibition and product design.
With her fashion/art installations she established the multidisciplinary work practice that has continued in her present work. A close collaboration between artists and craftsmen from various disciplines is essential to the realization of her installations, exhibition design and product design.
She engages in a playful relationship with the human body and it’s physical surroundings from which is extracted simple conceptual devices and frameworks for expressing her artistic vision.  With unfamiliar materials, sounds, settings and spatial compositions, she cultivates a personal idiom of new forms both complex and beautiful.
Her choices are few and distinctive; an intuitive arrangement and intertwining of juxtapositions and contrasts strikes a chord that ultimately carries her sensual vision of the entire installations and spacial designs. A distinct aesthetic feel runs through the work of Annette Meyer.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Ann (NYSE:ANN) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Annette Meier Appointed to GOED Board
Company co-founder brings entrepreneurship and rural roots to the board
SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH—The Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) is pleased to announce the recent appointment of Annette Meier, COO of Superior Drilling Products (SDPI), to the GOED Board of Directors.
“We’re excited over how many new faces we’ve been adding to the GOED Board,” said Val Hale, executive director of GOED. “Annette will provide a fresh perspective and a unique understanding of entrepreneurship, rural business and the energy industry.”
Meier is co-founder, director, president and chief operating officer at SDPI, having more than 20 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. She originally co-founded SDPI’s predecessor, Rocky Mountain Diamond, with her husband, Troy Meier, in 1993. Since SDPI’s inception in 1999, Meier has managed all the company’s day-to-day operations and business. In 2008, she envisioned and co-created “CHUCK,” the company’s custom shop management and inventory program software. Meier was also instrumental to the development of the “nucleus grinding system,” that is currently utilized in SDPI’s new manufacturing processes. In 2005, Meier served as the creator and chief architect of the Ropers Business Park, SDPI’s manufacturing facilities campus in Vernal, Utah.
A veteran of project management for new technologies, Meier has been the recipient of numerous state, local and industry awards over the years recognizing her for innovation and leadership. A resident of Vernal, Utah in the Uintah Basin, Meier lives with her husband of 35 years and is the proud mother of 3 children and 8 grandchildren.
“I’m honored by the opportunity to be on the GOED board,” Meier said. “The board members are an amazing group of people, and I look forward to getting to learn from them and work with them. I believe Utah is a wonderful state for business. The Uintah Basin, for example, has a great economic development team, but it’s nice to be able to provide a little more rural representation here at the state level. I’m excited for what we have to offer each other.”
