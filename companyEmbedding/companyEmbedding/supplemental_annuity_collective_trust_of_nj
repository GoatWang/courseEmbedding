SUPPLEMENTAL ANNUITY COLLECTIVE TRUST (SACT)
                    of NEW JERSEY
The Supplemental Annuity 
                    Collective Trust of New Jersey (SACT) is a voluntary investment 
                    program that provides retirement income separate from, and 
                    in addition to, your basic pension plan. Your contributions 
                    are invested conservatively in the stock market. The program 
                    consists of two separate plans, the SACT-Regular Plan and 
                    the SACT-Tax-Sheltered Plan (IRC Section 403(b)). 
 Under the Regular Plan, 
                    your contributions are taken from salary that has been subject 
                    to federal income tax. When funds are withdrawn at retirement 
                    or separation of service, the contributions are not subject 
                    to federal income tax, but the earnings on those contributions 
                    are taxable. 
Under the Tax-Sheltered Plan 
                    you enter into a salary reduction agreement with your employer, 
                    so that the salary your employer reports to the Internal 
                    Revenue Service is reduced by the amount of your contributions. 
                    When the funds are withdrawn at retirement or separation, 
                    the contributions and earnings are subject to federal taxation 
                    as ordinary income. New Jersey Gross Income Tax and Social 
                    Security do not afford similar tax-sheltered benefits and 
                    those taxes must be paid on gross salary during participation 
                    in SACT.
ELIGIBILITY FOR SACT
To be eligible to participate 
                    in the SACT-Regular Plan, you must be an actively contributing 
                    member of one of the State-administered retirement systems:

TPAF - Teachers' Pension and 
                            Annuity Fund
                        


 PFRS 
                        - Police and Firemen's Retirement System 



SPRS - State Police Retirement 
                            System
                        



JRS - Judicial Retirement System
                        


Eligibility for the SACT-Tax-Sheltered 
                    Plan also requires membership in a State-administered 
                    retirement system. In addition, you must be employed by a 
                    public educational institution. Elected officials are ineligible 
                    for the SACT Tax-sheltered Plan. 
ENROLLMENT 
You can obtain the necessary 
                    enrollment form(s) from your Human Resource Representative, 
                    your Board of Education Office, or directly from SACT.

                    and forward the completed form to the SACT office. All SACT 
                    enrollments are processed quarterly. You and your employer 
                    will receive confirmation copies and your enrollment will 
                    be effective the next calendar quarter. You may change your 
                    rate of contribution or stop (suspend) deductions at the beginning 
                    of a quarter by timely completing a SACT

                    forwards them to the SACT office. All SACT enrollments are 
                    processed quarterly. You and your employer will receive confirmation 
                    copies, and your enrollment will be effective the next calendar 
                    quarter. Salary reduction agreements may be filed once each 
                    calendar quarter. You may change your rate of contribution 
                    or stop (suspend) deductions by timely completing a SACT

                    Reduction Agreement. Adobe 
                    PDF (7K)
CONTRIBUTION LIMITS
The SACT-Regular Plan 
                    allows contributions in whole percentages beginning at 1 percent 
                    of your base salary. The maximum contribution allowable falls 
                    under the $53,000 IRCAIS limits for 2016 (includes Pension 
                    414(h) contributions). Lump-sum contributions of $50 or more 
                    are allowed in the third month of any calendar quarter. Although 
                    your contributions to the regular plan are "after tax 
                    contributions," your accumulated earnings are deferred 
                    from federal tax until you withdraw your money. 
 The SACT-Tax-Sheltered 
                    Plan allows contributions in whole percentages beginning 
                    at 1 percent of your compensation (base salary minus pension 
                    contribution). The maximum contribution allowable is the prevailing 
                    IRS maximum for all 403(b) plans ($18,000 in 2016 if under 
                    age 50, $24,000 for individuals age 50 and older). Your contributions 
                    are excluded from your income for federal income tax purposes.
DISTRIBUTIONS
Generally, your SACT-Regular 
                    or SACT-Tax-Sheltered account may only be paid out when you 
                    cease to be an active member of the basic retirement system 
                    due to withdrawal, death, or retirement. If you withdraw from 
                    the pension system, you must also withdraw your SACT account 
                    as a lump-sum settlement. If you die before you retire, your 
                    beneficiary will receive a lump-sum settlement of your account. 
                    If your beneficiary is a person (as opposed to an institution 
                    or charity), he or she may elect to receive a variable annuity 
                    under one of the distribution options of the plan. If you 
                    retire, SACT will provide a quotation of your account with 
                    detailed distribution options. There are six available options: 
                  

 a monthly variable annuity for your 
                      life only; 


 a lump-sum settlement; 


 a monthly variable annuity with guaranteed 
                      benefits to you or your beneficiary for 5 years and for 
                      your life only thereafter; 


 a monthly variable annuity with guaranteed 
                      benefits to you or your beneficiary for 10 years and for 
                      your life only thereafter; 


 a monthly variable annuity for your 
                      life with your beneficiary to receive an equal variable 
                      annuity benefit after your death; or


 a monthly variable annuity for your 
                      life with your beneficiary to receive one-half of the variable 
                      annuity benefit after your death. 

An explanation of each option will be provided 
                    upon request. Your necessary paperwork for account distribution 
                    should be filed within 30 days after your effective date of 
                    retirement. This is because, if you elect to receive a lump-sum 
                    settlement, your account does not participate in the Trust 
                    after the close of the month in which you cease to be a member 
                    of the basic retirement system. Your account value will be 
                    frozen as of the close of that month and no additional earnings 
                    will be credited to your account beyond that date. 
SPECIAL TRANSFER OPTION BEFORE TERMINATION OF ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP
                    IN A BASIC RETIREMENT SYSTEM
Chapter 77, P.L. 1996, made 
                    it possible for employees of the Department of Education, 
                    the Commission on Higher Education, or the governing body 
                    of any public institution of higher education to transfer 
                    funds between tax-sheltered annuity, 403(b), accounts with 
                    the various authorized investment providers under the Additional 
                    Contributions Tax-Sheltered (ACTS) Program and the SACT. Prior 
                    to this, state law prohibited such transfers into and out 
                    of the SACT. Effective January 1, 1997, any eligible employee 
                    may authorize the transfer of all or any portion of a tax-sheltered 
                    annuity account with the SACT to be transferred to a similar 
                    account with any authorized ACTS investment provider. Likewise, 
                    all or any portion of a tax-sheltered annuity account with 
                    any authorized ACTS investment provider may be transferred 
                    to an account with the SACT.
 If you are employed by one 
                    of the educational organizations mentioned above and are interested 
                    in transferring funds from your SACT-Tax-Sheltered account 
                    to an ACTS account, you should contact an ACTS investment 
                    provider to establish an account and obtain the necessary 
                    transfer form. If you are interested in transferring funds 
                    from your ACTS account to a SACT-Tax-Sheltered account, you 
                    should contact the SACT office for the necessary transfer 
                    form.
TAX CONSEQUENCES
 Your settlement check stub(s) 
                    provides information necessary for filing your income tax 
                    returns. In addition, at the end of the year in which you 
                    receive your distribution(s), the Division of Pensions and 
                    Benefits will issue Form 1099R to those receiving 
                    lump-sum distributions or monthly annuity checks. Earnings 
                    on a lump-sum distribution from the SACT-Regular Plan or an 
                    entire SACT-Tax-Sheltered distribution are eligible for rollover 
                    to an Individual Retirement Account.
QUESTIONS
Contact the SACT office 
                    of the Division of Pensions and Benefits in writing or call 
                    (609) 633-2031.  The SACT office will answer your questions and forward account 
                    information and any necessary forms.

Supplemental Annuity Collective Trust of New Jersey (SACT)


Quote


Postby fireman44 » Thu Jun 23, 2016 1:18 pm 
Hello everyone. I just recently found out about this Supplemental Annuity Collective Trust (SACT) that New Jersey offers. I wanted to start a discussion on this SACT. I am in the early stages of my research. I will share everything I have learned thus far. I am hoping some other people from New Jersey have experience or advice, or if anyone else has ever researched it or is interested in looking through the information.My ultimate goal is to see if it's worth investing in. Information is very limited online about the SACT and trying to track down the stocks they invest in is tough.Eligibility: Employees who are actively contributing members of one of the following state-administered retirement systems are eligible to participate in SACT Regular.Judicial Retirement System (JRS)Teachers’ Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF)Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS)Police and Firemen’s Retirement System (PFRS)State Police Retirement System (SPRS){The SACT plan is a 403(b)} The SACT-Regular Plan allows contributions in whole percentages beginning at 1 percent of your base salary. The maximum contribution allowable falls under the $53,000 IRCAIS limits for 2016 (includes Pension 414(h) contributions). Lump-sum contributions of $50 or more are allowed in the third month of any calendar quarter. Although your contributions to the regular plan are "after tax contributions," your accumulated earnings are deferred from federal tax until you withdraw your money."The Supplemental Annuity Collective Trust provides a variable annuity asopposed to the fixed annuity benefits of the State administered retirementsystems. The fixed annuity benefits of these systems provide a guaranteedamount regardless of economic conditions and the performance of underlyinginvestments. However, over time, inflation will erode at least a portion ofthe purchasing power of these fixed benefits. By supplementing your retirementsystem benefits with a variable annuity from the Trust, you have thepotential to increase the amount of your retirement income through the appreciationof the underlying investments of the Trust"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/pension ... handbk.pdf( This link gives all the basic information on the SACT)The profits they list are in Unit Values. The last year they show is 2013.http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/deferred/sact.shtmlJuly	2013	75.3337  June	2013	72.1644  May	2013	73.3738  April	2013	71.8395  March 2013	70.7088  February 2013	68.2962  January 2013	67.6088  December	2012	64.6331  November	2012	64.4278  October 2012	64.2862  September	 2012	65.7004  August 2012	64.2602  July 2012	63.1320  June	2012	62.5365  May	2012	60.2980  April	2012	64.0390  March 2012	64.5729  February 2012	63.2730  January 2012	61.5859  December	2011	59.6947  November	2011	59.1500  October	2011	58.9901  September	2011	53.6614  August	2011	57.5872  July	2011	60.9810  June	2011	62.3742  May	2011	63.5929  April	2011	64.3139  March	2011	61.2140  February	2011	61.3458  January	2011	59.5480  December	2010	58.6890  November	2010	55.9697  October	2010	56.1529  September	2010	54.7458  August	2010	51.1929  July	2010	52.8842  June	2010	50.1476  May	2010	52.6003  April	2010	56.4044  March 2010	53.8407  February 2010	51.8363  January 2010	50.4984  December 2009	51.9323  November 2009	51.1409  October 2009	48.4146  September 2009	49.2613  August 2009	47.7934  July	2009	46.9180  June	2009	44.2856  May	2009	44.8538  April	2009	43.0230  March 2009	40.9865  February 2009	38.3128  January 2009	42.4718  December	2008	45.2130  November	2008	44.1957  October 2008	47.0543  September	 2008	55.6247  August 2008	60.3652  July	2008	59.4224  June	2008	59.8911  May	2008	66.1912  April	2008	65.2104  March 2008	62.1107  February 2008	63.0920  January 2008	64.3912  Now here are some links I found wrote by Joel Frank in favor of SACThttp://board.403bwise.com/index.php?showtopic=5716http://board.403bwise.com/index.php?showtopic=5410Now it seems like all fees for this are covered by the state.   But KROW36 from here on Bogleheads questions that.viewtopic.php?t=179734"I believe that although the fees of the SACT fund are not disclosed, they exist, and are subtracted from the unreported but calculable rate of return (ROR). Every mutual fund, or portfolio of mutual funds, has expenses. The SACT fund expenses are subtracted out of its returns before they report their "unit values".KROW36 also compared the SACT "I also found the Unit Values page for the Supplemental Annuity Collective Trust (SACT) but was hoping they provide the rate of return over the years. Maybe they aren’t all that proud of their ROR? I used the unit values for December for some recent years and calculated the ROR. For a comparison I used Vanguard’s LifeStrategy Moderate Growth which uses a 60/40 asset allocation and includes International stocks and bonds. I noticed that the unit values for 2013 were incomplete and 2014 was missing.-----------SACT ROR——LSMG ROR2012————8.27%——— 11.76%2011————1.71———— 0.262010————13.01——— 13.312009————14.86——— 20.332008———— -34.13—— -26.502007—————0.33——— 7.36The SACT is very opaque, and doesn’t seem to outperform a diversified index fund portfolio.""I calculated a few more years of the ROR of the SACT fund and compared it to the ROR of the Vanguard Life Strategy Moderate Growth.SACT.------SACT ROR——LSMG ROR2012——— 8.27%—— 11.76%2011——— 1.71——— 0.262010——— 13.01—— 13.312009——— 14.86—— 20.332008********* -34.13***** -26.502007——— 0.33—— 7.362006——— 11.85—— 13.312005——— 4.35—— 5.692004——— 8.21—— 10.572003——— 23.56—— 22.402002******** -27.47** -10.322001******** -12.04** -4.48 I would steer clear of the SACT fund 403b because of The significant outperformance over time of the Vanguard fund over the SACT 403b"now when i googled SACT NJ STOCKS i finally found their investmentshttp://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutio ... -nj-820828http://www.octafinance.com/hedge-funds/ ... ust-of-nj/a 2014 audit:http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/pension ... act-14.pdfsorry to throw so much information out there.I tried to organize all this information the best I could and give a good presentation.I am trying to figure out if the SACT is really worth it for me to invest in.I am opening a 457(b) plan with Valic (the best sponser my company offers) but I just found out about this SACT.Thank you all for reading and any information or advice you may have on the SACT of NJ

The regular annuity is not a good investment, because it is an after-tax variable annuity, invested in stocks.  (I couldn't see a description of exactly what the trust is invested in, but the 2007-2009 returns, in which the annuity lost half its value, imply a mostly-stock investment.)The problem with holding stocks in a variable annuity (or non-deductible IRA) is that the tax cost is usually increased compared to a taxable account.  The tax on gains is deferred, not eliminated, and when you do withdraw, any gains are taxed at your full tax rate.  If you invest in a stock index fund in a taxable account, you'll probably come out ahead; you pay tax on the stock dividends every year, but that is a small part of the return.  Most of the tax on gains is deferred until you sell, and that tax is at the lower capital-gains tax rate.The tax-sheltered annuity (open only for employees of educational institutions) is a better deal, as it is a pre-tax 403(b) plan; your contributions are deductible and withdrawals are fully taxable.  However, it has a disadvantage compared to other retirement plans which is specific to NJ.  NJ does not allow a deduction for contributions to 403(b) plans.  If you retire in NJ, you don't pay NJ tax on the amount that was non-deductible, since it was already taxed; if you retire in another state, you pay tax on the whole withdrawal.  Thus, while it is still a good investment, it's better to max out your Roth IRA first.

Thanks for the reply.The SACT  looks to be all invested in stocks:http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutio ... -nj-820828Sector WeightingBasic Materials	2.51%Capital Goods	5.37%Conglomerates	0.23%Consumer Cyclical	3.21%Consumer/Non-Cyclical	8.7%Energy	5.74%Financial	19.9%Healthcare	13.25%Services	18.56%Technology	16.34%Transportation	2.42%Utilities	3.71%I wouldn't have access to the tax sheltered annuity as I am not part of an educational institution. My fear with this SACT is I will be invested for 18 more years. ( when I retire )It is heavily invested in Stocks and I have no way for control AA.

It's fine to have your annuity portfolio in stocks if you can hold enough bonds in your Roth IRA and taxable account to get your desired allocation.In NJ, it is particularly attractive to use either NJ munis or Treasury bonds in your taxable account (depending on your tax bracket), as NJ does not tax capital gains on "qualified investment funds" which hold bonds exempt from NJ tax.

I agree with grabiner, forget the "regular" annuity, and if you can't use the tax deferred annuity, then forget the SACT. Fully fund your Roth IRA and your 457b, and after that, contribute to a low cost Vanguard taxable account.

I would max out Deferred Compensation with Prudential first.  Friend of mine just retired and had to close his SACT account upon retirement.  He was taxed on the income gained on his investment upon its liquidation.

This is a voluntary 403b investment plan.  It is run by the NJ Division of Pensions.  The Trustees have never adopted an investment menu.  All employee contributions are invested in a common stock portfolio invested by the Division of Investment.
Q.:  I feel a lack of an investment menu is a breach of prudence.  Would a Class Action to compel the Trustees to adopt an investment menu succeed?

What is the NJ statute that you would use to allege a breach of prudence? NJ is exempt from ERISA so only a NJ statute that applies to NJ state government could be used. And NJ has sovereign immunity.

What is the legal authority under IRC Section 403(b) for investments in something other than mutual funds or annuity contracts issued by insurance companies?

In 1986 Congress amended 403b to specifically limit funding to annuity contract and mutual funds. However, under a 1967 IRS ruling 4 govt entities had established 403b plans that were held in trusts  including NYC and NJ. The 1986 change grandfathered these plans just as Congress grandfathered 401k plans established by government employers prior to Jun 2, 1986 which is why NYC has a 401k plan for all city employees as well as a 457b plan and 403b.

This proposed Class Action would be brought in NJ State Court under the statutes that govern trusts and fiduciary duties.  This is the same statute that governs the fiduciary duties of all of the Trust Funds of NJ including the Defined Benefit pension system which is a public trust fund. 
With that said, do you feel the Plaintiff would win?

What is the NJ statute that requires exercise of fiduciary duty and how is the 403b plan covered under it? General fiduciary principles don't apply.
And the state of NJ has sovereign immunity. If the NJ supreme court says that NJ does not have to fund the state pension at the amount that it promised to pay what NJ law requires the state to follow fiduciary rules to keep the plan funded? 
Final question: what law firm would litigate a case against a state government that has sovereign immunity for a contingency fee based on unknown damages at some unknown time in the future?

The plaintiff who sues the state is the party who is required to state what provision of NJ law imposes a fiduciary duty on the state pension plan. If the complaint is not based on applicable law it will be dismissed. No brainer.
If you want to know if there is a fiduciary law that governs the state pension plan contact the NJ Division of Pensions and Benefits of the NJ Treasury dept. PO Box 295, Trenton NJ 08625-0295.

Please answer my direct question rather than providing an address.
With that said, you know the minute details of why the state of NJ and the City of New York were allowed to continue to run their 403(b) plans notwithstanding the 1986 federal amendment to section 403(b).  With your vast knowledge of governmental 403(b) plans surely you know that 403(b) plans must operate for the sole benefit of the participants.  Who would dare say that the absence of a diversified investment menu is for the sole benefit of the participants?  Would you?

If by "diversified investment menu" you imply participant direction of investment, I would assert that the absence is not adverse to the interests of beneficiaries. It is certainly not required by ERISA, if one looks that direction for guidance or wisdom. It is well documented that individual participant investment direction results on average in significant underperformance of the portfolio.
If you mean that a  common stock portfolio cannot be operated solely in the interests of beneficiaries, you need to  make an argument for the position rather than issue dares.

Joel:
You posted your question under the govt plans topic which discusses plans that are exempt from ERISA fiduciary provisions that you referred to.There is nothing in IRC 403b that requires 403b plans to operate for the sole benefit of participants and there is nothing in the tax law that requires diversified investments to be available to participants in a 403b plan.
I don't what you are trying to prove but you sure are not connecting the dots.
Q- I accidently hit the tab to your response and then exited without many any changes. Sorry for the confusion.

In 1986 Congress amended 403b to specifically limit funding to annuity contract and mutual funds. However, under a 1967 IRS ruling 4 govt entities had established 403b plans that were held in trusts  including NYC and NJ. The 1986 change grandfathered these plans just as Congress grandfathered 401k plans established by government employers prior to Jun 2, 1986 which is why NYC has a 401k plan for all city employees as well as a 457b plan and 403b.
mbozek,
How is NYC able to offer a 401(k) plan?  The NYC 401(k) started in 2002; the 457(b) started in 1986.

A small autonomous NYC agency adopted a 401k plan prior to the 1986 cutoff date when it became grandfathered. Under the regulations for grandfathered 401k plans any other agencies, instrumentatilities or government entitles of the same municipality can adopt the grandfathered 401k plan after 1986. In 2002 NYC adopted the 401k plan for all NYC workers.

MJB:   if the 401(k) was established by a City of NY agency prior to the 1986 cutoff date when it was grandfathered in, why did the City wait 18 years to offer it to its entire workforce?

I am taking a guess but is it because it wasn't until EGTRRA (eff. 2002) that you could double up on both 401k and 457(b)?

Hello everyone. I just recently found out about this Supplemental Annuity Collective Trust (SACT) that New Jersey offers. I wanted to start a discussion on this SACT. I am in the early stages of my research. I will share everything I have learned thus far. I am hoping some other people from New Jersey have experience or advice, or if anyone else has ever researched it or is interested in looking through the information.My ultimate goal is to see if it's worth investing in. Information is very limited online about the SACT and trying to track down the stocks they invest in is tough.Eligibility: Employees who are actively contributing members of one of the following state-administered retirement systems are eligible to participate in SACT Regular.Judicial Retirement System (JRS)Teachers’ Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF)Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS)Police and Firemen’s Retirement System (PFRS)State Police Retirement System (SPRS){The SACT plan is a 403(b)} The SACT-Regular Plan allows contributions in whole percentages beginning at 1 percent of your base salary. The maximum contribution allowable falls under the $53,000 IRCAIS limits for 2016 (includes Pension 414(h) contributions). Lump-sum contributions of $50 or more are allowed in the third month of any calendar quarter. Although your contributions to the regular plan are "after tax contributions," your accumulated earnings are deferred from federal tax until you withdraw your money."The Supplemental Annuity Collective Trust provides a variable annuity asopposed to the fixed annuity benefits of the State administered retirementsystems. The fixed annuity benefits of these systems provide a guaranteedamount regardless of economic conditions and the performance of underlyinginvestments. However, over time, inflation will erode at least a portion ofthe purchasing power of these fixed benefits. By supplementing your retirementsystem benefits with a variable annuity from the Trust, you have thepotential to increase the amount of your retirement income through the appreciationof the underlying investments of the Trust"http://www.state.nj.... ... handbk.pdf( This link gives all the basic information on the SACT)The profits they list are in Unit Values. The last year they show is 2013.http://www.state.nj....rred/sact.shtmlJuly 2013 75.3337 June 2013 72.1644 May 2013 73.3738 April 2013 71.8395 March 2013 70.7088 February 2013 68.2962 January 2013 67.6088 December 2012 64.6331 November 2012 64.4278 October 2012 64.2862 September 2012 65.7004 August 2012 64.2602 July 2012 63.1320 June 2012 62.5365 May 2012 60.2980 April 2012 64.0390 March 2012 64.5729 February 2012 63.2730 January 2012 61.5859 December 2011 59.6947 November 2011 59.1500 October 2011 58.9901 September 2011 53.6614 August 2011 57.5872 July 2011 60.9810 June 2011 62.3742 May 2011 63.5929 April 2011 64.3139 March 2011 61.2140 February 2011 61.3458 January 2011 59.5480 December 2010 58.6890 November 2010 55.9697 October 2010 56.1529 September 2010 54.7458 August 2010 51.1929 July 2010 52.8842 June 2010 50.1476 May 2010 52.6003 April 2010 56.4044 March 2010 53.8407 February 2010 51.8363 January 2010 50.4984 December 2009 51.9323 November 2009 51.1409 October 2009 48.4146 September 2009 49.2613 August 2009 47.7934 July 2009 46.9180 June 2009 44.2856 May 2009 44.8538 April 2009 43.0230 March 2009 40.9865 February 2009 38.3128 January 2009 42.4718 December 2008 45.2130 November 2008 44.1957 October 2008 47.0543 September 2008 55.6247 August 2008 60.3652 July 2008 59.4224 June 2008 59.8911 May 2008 66.1912 April 2008 65.2104 March 2008 62.1107 February 2008 63.0920 January 2008 64.3912 Now here are some links I found wrote by Joel Frank in favor of SACThttp://board.403bwis...?showtopic=5716http://board.403bwis...?showtopic=5410Now it seems like all fees for this are covered by the state. But KROW36 from here on Bogleheads questions that.viewtopic.php?t=179734"I believe that although the fees of the SACT fund are not disclosed, they exist, and are subtracted from the unreported but calculable rate of return (ROR). Every mutual fund, or portfolio of mutual funds, has expenses. The SACT fund expenses are subtracted out of its returns before they report their "unit values".KROW36 also compared the SACT "I also found the Unit Values page for the Supplemental Annuity Collective Trust (SACT) but was hoping they provide the rate of return over the years. Maybe they aren’t all that proud of their ROR? I used the unit values for December for some recent years and calculated the ROR. For a comparison I used Vanguard’s LifeStrategy Moderate Growth which uses a 60/40 asset allocation and includes International stocks and bonds. I noticed that the unit values for 2013 were incomplete and 2014 was missing.-----------SACT ROR——LSMG ROR2012————8.27%——— 11.76%2011————1.71———— 0.262010————13.01——— 13.312009————14.86——— 20.332008———— -34.13—— -26.502007—————0.33——— 7.36The SACT is very opaque, and doesn’t seem to outperform a diversified index fund portfolio.""I calculated a few more years of the ROR of the SACT fund and compared it to the ROR of the Vanguard Life Strategy Moderate Growth.SACT.------SACT ROR——LSMG ROR2012——— 8.27%—— 11.76%2011——— 1.71——— 0.262010——— 13.01—— 13.312009——— 14.86—— 20.332008********* -34.13***** -26.502007——— 0.33—— 7.362006——— 11.85—— 13.312005——— 4.35—— 5.692004——— 8.21—— 10.572003——— 23.56—— 22.402002******** -27.47** -10.322001******** -12.04** -4.48I would steer clear of the SACT fund 403b because of The significant outperformance over time of the Vanguard fund over the SACT 403b"now when i googled SACT NJ STOCKS i finally found their investmentshttp://www.nasdaq.co... ... -nj-820828

OK, I'll bite.
I don't know anything about the SACT NJ. I thought Tony would respond as I believe he knows about SACT NJ.
Other comments:
Past performance is not important.
If you cannot get the fund choices, the asset class and the ER, there isn't much we can respond too. We need this information so we can construct a balanced diversified portfolio.
I noticed on one of your links the form is dated 1999.
Forget about the specific sponsor for a minute. What is your question? And then a discussion might ensue.

Fireman44, I'm online only occasionally this summer and just spotted your thread. I don't envy you trying to decide whether SACT is worth using or not. My guess it's a "black box" designed to make money for the financial industry. SACT earns a return but takes a greater risk than a VG balanced fund like their Life Strategy fund of funds.
 
You might be better using a mutual fund product with VALIC (not an annuity product!). You'd know the expense ratio and other fees.
 
A further problem you need to consider is that NJ doesn't let you defer your 403b (and 457b?) contributions from your income. It seems to me that a big advantage to contributing to tax-deferred accounts isn't there for you. 
 
I think a taxable account for  retirement at VG has some advantages over deferred accounts for NJ residents that you should consider.

Thank you for your responses Sschullo and Krow36.

	 
My initial question was to see if This SACT was worth investing into.
A little background on me which I failed to provide.
I am a professional firefighter in New Jersey. I have 7 years on the job and after 25 years I can retire and collect a pension. ( 65% of my last year completed salary )
Now the pension system is underfunded and there is a lot of worrying by NJ employees that our pension will still be available the way it is written up now.
 
My wife is pregnant with our first child and is due in October. So this has really woken up in setting up a life insurance policy on myself and on my wife. And setting up retirement accounts.
I will be turning 31 in August and I will be 48 when I complete 25 years with the option to retire.
 
457(b) is available in my city.  Metlife, AXA, and Valic are the options and all are annuities based. After gathering all the information, Valic is the best option.  Having the lowest fees and Vanguard available as an Investment Option. 
 
The fees on VG LifeStrategy
Acquired Fund Fees - 0.15%
Total Fund Fees - 0.15%
Net Fund Expenses - 0.15%
Net Separate Account Fees - 0.65% ( This includes the mortality and expense fees)
Total Net Variable Account Account Option Fees - 0.80%
 
I don't know a lot about fees but these don't seem very bloated and are lower then the majority of options from AXA and Metlife.
 
Currently I have been dumping all my money into a credit union that offers 3% saving accounts and compounds daily. I always thought I wouldn't need any retirement accounts with this guaranteed 3% interest.  But everyone says it is good to diversify. Which is why I was going to do a 457(b) and also thinking of investing in the SACT.  I don't know a lot about Ira and Roth Ira.  The main thing that attracts me to the 457(b) is tax deferred and I can withdraw all my money if I decide to retire at 48 years old.   IRA and Roth IRA i believe you must be 59 to pull your money out.

Fireman
 
You need to hang around this site and learn all you can about investing. At your age you should be mostly in stocks. You are right to say you need to diversify. A bank won't help you get over the hump for retirement. You should save as if you won't get a pension because one never knows the future. Better to be safe. Too many folks I have known in education count on their pensions and don't save. I always ask them: "What if the pension was taken away from you or reduced? How would you make it? Better to cover all your bases. And yes you and your wife should have life insurance. Go with term insurance. Does your local city employer offer you any investments options or insurance options? 
 
In your situation currently, after having enough liquid savings in a  bank or money market savings  account, I would invest directly in a Roth IRA through Vanguard. Your wife may be eligible as well. You can read more on Roth accounts on this site.
 
Keep saving and keep learning but beware of financial advisors unless they are fee only and with a reputable organization. Stay away from insurance companies that pedal annuities. Use insurance companies only for insurance and not investing.

Fireman,
Any LifeStrategy funds are popular these days as the managers rebalance the holdings as you get closer to retirement.
 
BTW, what credit union pays 3% on its savings account?! It must be some type of stable value, or some kind of agreement.
My credit union and 99% of savings accounts everywhere else is paying something in the order of <.05%.

Hey Tony, 
 
 Thanks for the tips and advice. I definitely will be hanging around this site to learn more!!
My city just offers the 457 (b) plan through those three options I listed and the SACT I talked about in my original post is offered by the State.
 
I see myself bouncing from the 25%-28% tax brackets through the rest of my career.  (depending on if my wife is working or not in certain years, filing jointly)
I would retire and have a lower salary through the pension then I did while I was working. However, the tax brackets will pretty much almost be the same or slightly different.
 So based off that theory I would assume the traditional IRA is more aligned towards my situation.    And a negative would be that I couldn't touch the money until I am 59.     On average, professional firefighters don't live very long lives.

Steve, 
It's a credit union in my city. They are constantly giving out loans to city workers for 8% or 9% and that is why they can offer a higher interest rate in the savings.

What did you think of the fees I mentioned by Valic for the 457 (b) plan? For that VG LifeStrategy investment.

I have been trying (and accomplishing ) to consolidate most of my funds into The Life strategy moderate growth fund which has a 60-40 allocation. All in index  funds. Outside of this I am buying only extra  bonds . I am trying to have only two fund-four funds total. You will be paying much more for the Life Strategy than I am. I am paying .15% total and you should not have to pay .80% for the same fund.  I realize your options are limited. Thats why you should go direct with an IRA first before considering what to do next.
 
Thank-you for being a firefighter. You guys don't always get the attention and respect you deserve.

Hi Fire,
Yeah, but don't all credit unions give out loans or other expensive services? When I have a check that draws from my overbalance account, wow, they charge a lot! Obviously, I am very careful about using that service.
So  whatever reason, you are fortunate. I would use it for a portion of your fixed account. All portfolios, no matter what your age, should have a portion in fixed accounts. Sure bond funds might pay a little more, but there are interest rate changes which add risk that is not in a savings account.
 
Talk to a VALIC rep and ask him or her about the total fees that you will be paying. Remember, these folks are under no obligation whether legal or not, to be transparent about fees. The vast majority of reps tell you a portion, but not the entire picture. For the information you gave, it looks like its a variable annuity with M&E fees. M&E fees are a totally unnecessary cost to protect your investment (that's the sales pitch) but its really a total rip off. For that reason alone, it doesn't look like a good option because of the fees in just about all variable annuity contracts. The only low cost VA is from TIAA.
 
Keep looking and tell us what you found. You are looking for funds that diversify your portfolio. Look for a new thread that I will start where I show my portfolio, and what a fully diversified portfolio looks like. As I said in another post, I got a 4.7% return YTD.
 
happy 4th,
Steve

Thank you for the kind words Tony. 

Steve these are the fees for VALIC. The fees on VG LifeStrategy
Acquired Fund Fees - 0.15%
Total Fund Fees - 0.15%
Net Fund Expenses - 0.15%
Net Separate Account Fees - 0.65% ( This includes the mortality and expense fees)
Total Net Variable Account Account Option Fees - 0.80%
 
The fees are not VERY HIGH compared to other life insurance companies for variable annuities for 457 (b) plans that I have seen.
However I know I should stay away from variable annunities.  In my case though I don't have any other options through my city.
I have scheduled a meeting on July 18 with my city plan Administrator. I am going to try and convince her to bring In Vanguard or Fidelity to offer 457(b) plans to us so we can benefit from the low fees.
If it does not work out then I will most likely go with VALIC to take advantage of the tax deferred plan.
 
Also Tony suggested for me to open a Roth IRA. I have done research on it the past couple of days.  I want to open one now as it looks like a great option to even further diversity my portfolio.
However who should I go through for the Roth IRA?  Everyone talks highly of Vanguard but there are so many options out there.  
And if you could provide me some direction on where to invest in the Roth IRA, I would greatly appreciate it.
I am turning 31 and would not be able to withdraw until 28 more years. I would be depositing the max $5,500 every single year.
And my final question, after I pick my investment options within the Roth IRA,   would I just leave it alone for the next 28 more years. Or do I need to monitor it and change around my investment options every few years or so?

You could start with Vanguard Wellington, a 65% stock 35% bond allocation for your Roth. Call Vanguard and open up an account. With Wellington, you can leave it alone until you reach your 50s. But that is a long time. You need to keep an eye on your portfolio as it grows. You might need to rebalance, which is another topic, and learn not to panic when there is a crash, and to have a plan you understand.
 
I suggest that you read, The Bogleheads Guide to Investing. Find it here on Amazon. As Tony already suggested you have some learning to do, but you have a great start and this book will answer all of your questions.

Wellingtion would be great choice. One of the few great performing managed funds. So would the Vanguard Star Fund (only 1,000 opening minimum) or a Target Date Fund  that matches up with your retirement date or close to it and it is self managed. You could also do the same  life strategy fund in your IRA as well as doing it with Valic. Eventually your Roth Life Strategy with Vanguard will ourperform because of lower fees than with Valic
 
Who should you go through for your Roth IRA?   VANGUARD because of the low fees!!!!!! and honest management.  Why pay more?  Paying more gets you nothing more. It only gets you less.
 
Also yes. You need to leave it alone until retirement. Thats what it would be for. You will be rewarded if you keep adding to it and leave it alone for 25 years or so. If the fund at some point disappoints you, you can easily move it to a different Vanguard fund BUT don't go chasing performance because its a game you won't win.
 
You are asking all the right questions at your age.  Keep doing what you are doing and don't be afraid to ask questions AND to pursue better choices.

Fireman44, you're getting great advice. I agree with Tony, and I suggest you invest annually in a IRA for both you and your wife. Remember your wife doesn't have to be employed, she can contribute based on your salary. Either a Roth or a traditional would be OK. You can do some of both, and change which to use later when you learn about the pros and cons of each. I don't think you can go wrong with a Roth IRA at this stage of your career.
 
If you can confirm that the VALIC 457b has a total fee of 0.80% using the LSMG, I think it would be worth contributing to since it's your best deferred compensation choice.  
 
If you can contribute 11k in IRAs and 18k in the 457b, and are able to contribute more to your retirement, then I think it comes down to either the SACT or using a taxable account at Vanguard. I think I would vote for Vanguard. 
 
I think I misstated the NJ policy on tax deductibility in my post above. I should have said that deferred contributions are not deferred from NJ state income tax, but are deferred from federal income tax. Perhaps NJ firefighters are exempted from this?
