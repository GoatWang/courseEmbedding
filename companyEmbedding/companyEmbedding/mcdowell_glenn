Published on: November 15, 2016
Broker Glenn McDowell Terminated From National Securities

By Fitapelli Kurta






 


Publicly available records provided by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on November 14, 2016 indicate that former New York-based Woodstock Financial Group broker Glenn McDowell, also known as Clemend St. Aubyn McDowell, has been named in a pending FINRA complaint. The securities and investment fraud law firm Fitapelli Kurta is interested in hearing from investors who have complaints regarding Mr. McDowell (CRD# 2748337).
Glenn McDowell has spent seventeen years in the securities industry and was most recently registered with Woodstock Financial Group in New York, New York (2013-2015). Previous registrations include Olson, Cross & Alamo in New York, New York; National Securities in New York, New York; Valley Forge Securities in Rosemont, Pennsylvania; Kirlin Securities in Syosset, New York; and J.W. Barclay & Company in Woodbridge, New Jersey. He is currently not registered with any state or firm.
According to his BrokerCheck report, Glenn McDowell has received one pending FINRA complaint, one regulatory sanction, and three customer complaints that were closed or denied. He was also terminated from his position at National Securities.
In October 2016 FINRA named Glenn McDowell respondent in a complaint alleging he “executed unauthorized transactions in the account of a customer without first obtaining authorization” for which he earned approximately $5,300 in commissions.
In 2015 a customer alleged he, while employed at National Securities, misrepresented material facts related to an investment. The customer sought $140,135 in damages in the complaint, which was denied.
In 2014 a customer alleged he, while employed at National Securities, effected unauthorized transactions. The customer sought unspecified damages in the complaint, which was closed.
In 2013 Glenn Mcdowell was discharged from his position at National Securities following allegations he effected unauthorized transactions and exhibited poor performance.
In 2013 the State of Florida sanctioned Glenn McDowell following allegations he made a misleading statement on an application for registration. His registration in Florida was denied.
If you have complaints regarding Glenn McDowell, you may be able to recover lost funds. Call the securities and investment fraud law firm Fitapelli Kurta at 877-238-4175 for a free consultation. All cases are taken on contingency: Fitapelli Kurta only gets paid if and when you recover money. You may have a limited window to file your claim, so we recommend you avoid delay. Call 877-238-4175 now to speak to an attorney for free.
