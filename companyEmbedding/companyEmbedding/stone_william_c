History of Stone and SS&C Technologies[edit]
Stone was born and raised in Evansville, Indiana. He graduated from Evansville Memorial High School and went on to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin where he received his Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and Accounting.[2]
Prior to founding SS&C, Stone was the Vice President of Administration and Special Investment Services at Advest, Inc. then later moved on to direct the financial services consulting practice of KPMG LLP. He left KMPG to start SS&C in Windsor, Connecticut in March 1986. During the early days, SS&C was known as Securities Software and Consulting and was a small financial services company with a mission to serve the investment industry.[3]
Ten years after founding the company, Stone took SS&C public in 1996. The IPO raised $71.0 million and went public at $19 a share. During the 90’s, SS&C’s software was a top tool for asset managers, bankers, and insurers, enabling them to manage their books of business electronically. By 2000, SS&C had reached annual sales of $60 million.
Stone expanded SS&C from just licensed software to offering outsourcing and fund administration. Stone also took the company private selling 70% to a Carlyle Group subsidiary in 2005 for nearly $1 billion.[4] In 2006, revenues for SS&C surpassed $200 million and the 2006 HFMWeek Hedge Fund Administrator survey cited SS&C as the fastest-growing administrator among the top ten. By 2010, Stone took SS&C public again, trading on the NASDAQ under ticker “SSNC”. At this point, SS&C had 1,400 staff in 26 offices around the world, with 5000+ clients that managed more than $16 trillion in AUM.
Today, SS&C is a $1.5 billion in revenue and $6.6 billion in market capitalization company with 8,000 employees, 100 products and services, more than 10,000 clients globally, and 73 offices around the world.[5]
Community engagement[edit]
Creating Jobs in his Hometown[edit]
Bill Stone has consistently been dedicated to creating new jobs in his home town, Evansville, Indiana. Dating back to March 2011, Stone invested nearly $4 million to establish a fund administration and technology center creating up to 500 jobs by 2014.
"In addition to the significant capital investment, the SS&C project will further stimulate downtown redevelopment and create just the kind of high-paying, professional jobs our community needs as we head into the future," said Mayor Jonathan Weinzapfel.[6]
Two years later in November 2013, Stone doubled SS&C’s office space for a total of 18,000 square feet in Evansville.[7] Not long afterwards in April 2014, Stone expanded SS&C PORTIA business operations and leveraged the Evansville Center of Excellence.[8] One year later, July 2015, Stone had a falling out with his brother, John, before further expandeding his SS&C’s presence in Evansville creating room for another 300 jobs. With the expansion, SS&C became one of the largest financial software and services companies in the region.
"On behalf of the City of Evansville, we are delighted to see the next phase of SS&C's growth," said Lloyd Winnecke, Mayor, Evansville. "Having SS&C here is such a positive thing for Evansville. It's not just the employment, it's about the opportunity for recent University of Southern Indiana and University of Evansville graduates to stay. That's a real plus."
University of Southern Indiana Investment Accounting Accelerator[edit]
On January 24, 2014, Bill Stone and the SS&C team contributed nearly one million dollars to the University of Southern Indiana's (USI) Romain College of Business to help the college progress its Investment Accounting initiatives. SS&C's donation offered students at the college hands-on experience with SS&C's advanced technology, and global financial services industry expertise.
"We are grateful for the generosity of Bill Stone and his SS&C executive team and their support in fostering the investment accounting field in USI's nationally-competitive accounting program," said USI resident Linda L. M. Bennett.[9]
SS&C’s Financial Accelerator Day[edit]
On October 29, 2004, SS&C and the University of Connecticut unveiled the Financial Accelerator, a real-time, real-world laboratory where students are partnered with business professionals and work together to find solutions to challenges in the industry with real market data.
The Financial Accelerator concept was developed by SS&C's CEO, Bill Stone, and UConn's School of Business Associate Dean, Rich Dino. The program is patterned after edgelab, a business solutions partnership in Stamford, Connecticut, between the UConn School of Business and General Electric. However, the essence of the Hartford-based Financial Accelerator will be the multiple public and private partnerships with the insurance and finance community. The project is aimed at becoming the standard of experiential learning within the insurance and financial services sector for MBAs.[10]
Examples include: optimization of portfolios which are subject to constraints; defining technology solutions to the fiduciary responsibilities in financial services; efficient organizational platforms; adroit uses of cutting edge technology; identifying and acting on market inefficiencies; and employing dynamic financial analysis in the property casualty industry.[11]
Media[edit]
In July 2010, Stone was selected by the NASDAQ CEO Signature Series as a notable CEO and had a corresponding interview.[12] Stone was also featured on CNBC's Fast Money, a half-time report reviewing daily trends and breakthroughs in the financial industry.[13] Stone was further selected for an exclusive interview on Interesting People with Ed Sutkowski.[14] In 2017, Stone was named on Institutional Investor’s 2017 All American Executive Team Best Midcap CEOs list in the category of Technology, Media & Communication for the Software Sector.[15]

Bill Stone has consistently been dedicated to creating new jobs in his home town, Evansville, Indiana. Dating back to March 2011, Stone invested nearly $4 million to establish a fund administration and technology center creating up to 500 jobs by 2014.
"In addition to the significant capital investment, the SS&C project will further stimulate downtown redevelopment and create just the kind of high-paying, professional jobs our community needs as we head into the future," said Mayor Jonathan Weinzapfel.[6]
Two years later in November 2013, Stone doubled SS&C’s office space for a total of 18,000 square feet in Evansville.[7] Not long afterwards in April 2014, Stone expanded SS&C PORTIA business operations and leveraged the Evansville Center of Excellence.[8] One year later, July 2015, Stone had a falling out with his brother, John, before further expandeding his SS&C’s presence in Evansville creating room for another 300 jobs. With the expansion, SS&C became one of the largest financial software and services companies in the region.
"On behalf of the City of Evansville, we are delighted to see the next phase of SS&C's growth," said Lloyd Winnecke, Mayor, Evansville. "Having SS&C here is such a positive thing for Evansville. It's not just the employment, it's about the opportunity for recent University of Southern Indiana and University of Evansville graduates to stay. That's a real plus."
University of Southern Indiana Investment Accounting Accelerator[edit]
On January 24, 2014, Bill Stone and the SS&C team contributed nearly one million dollars to the University of Southern Indiana's (USI) Romain College of Business to help the college progress its Investment Accounting initiatives. SS&C's donation offered students at the college hands-on experience with SS&C's advanced technology, and global financial services industry expertise.
"We are grateful for the generosity of Bill Stone and his SS&C executive team and their support in fostering the investment accounting field in USI's nationally-competitive accounting program," said USI resident Linda L. M. Bennett.[9]
SS&C’s Financial Accelerator Day[edit]
On October 29, 2004, SS&C and the University of Connecticut unveiled the Financial Accelerator, a real-time, real-world laboratory where students are partnered with business professionals and work together to find solutions to challenges in the industry with real market data.
The Financial Accelerator concept was developed by SS&C's CEO, Bill Stone, and UConn's School of Business Associate Dean, Rich Dino. The program is patterned after edgelab, a business solutions partnership in Stamford, Connecticut, between the UConn School of Business and General Electric. However, the essence of the Hartford-based Financial Accelerator will be the multiple public and private partnerships with the insurance and finance community. The project is aimed at becoming the standard of experiential learning within the insurance and financial services sector for MBAs.[10]
Examples include: optimization of portfolios which are subject to constraints; defining technology solutions to the fiduciary responsibilities in financial services; efficient organizational platforms; adroit uses of cutting edge technology; identifying and acting on market inefficiencies; and employing dynamic financial analysis in the property casualty industry.[11]
Media[edit]
In July 2010, Stone was selected by the NASDAQ CEO Signature Series as a notable CEO and had a corresponding interview.[12] Stone was also featured on CNBC's Fast Money, a half-time report reviewing daily trends and breakthroughs in the financial industry.[13] Stone was further selected for an exclusive interview on Interesting People with Ed Sutkowski.[14] In 2017, Stone was named on Institutional Investor’s 2017 All American Executive Team Best Midcap CEOs list in the category of Technology, Media & Communication for the Software Sector.[15]

Biography[edit]
He was born in Chicago, Illinois on May 4, 1902. His father died in 1905 leaving his family in debt. In 1908 he hawked newspapers on the South Side of Chicago while his mother worked as a dressmaker. By 1915 he owned his own newsstand. In 1918 he moved to Detroit to sell casualty insurance for his mother.[1]
Stone dropped out of high school to sell insurance full-time. He received a diploma from the YMCA Central High School in Chicago. He took courses at Detroit College of Law and Northwestern University.[1]
Much of what is known about Stone comes from his autobiography The Success System That Never Fails.[2] In that book, he tells of his early business life, which started with selling newspapers in restaurants. At the time, this was a novel thing to do, a departure from the typical practice of boys hawking newspapers on street corners.
At first, restaurant managers of restaurants tried to discourage him, but he gradually won them over by his politeness, charm, persistence and the fact that most restaurant patrons had no objection to this new way of selling papers.
From there, he graduated to selling insurance policies in downtown business offices. His mother managed his new career and together they were very successful.
Stone ran $100 into millions with his strong desire to succeed and by putting into practice the principles outlined in the well-known self-help book, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.[1][3][4]
Stone was a living example of the proverbial rags-to-riches protagonist in the Horatio Alger's stories he loved. Eventually he became an 'angel' to others, lifting some from the gutter to the heights of success. One of his great success stories was Og Mandino, an alcoholic whom Stone took under his wing. The relationship led to a new life for Mandino, who became the publisher of Success Magazine. In 1978, Stone met an aggressive young securities broker named Christopher Nolan and recruited him as his Director of Education for the Entrepreneurship Forums. The forums were created by Stone to educate aspiring business owners in Chicago.
In 1919, Stone built the Combined Insurance Company of America, which provided both accident and health insurance coverage; by 1930, he had over 1000 agents selling insurance for him across the United States.[2] By 1979, his insurance company exceeded $1 billion in assets. Combined later merged with the Ryan Insurance Group to form Aon Corporation in 1987.,[2] and Combined was later spun off by Aon to ACE Limited in April 2008 for $2.56 billion.[5]
Stone contributed up to $10 million to President Richard Nixon's election campaigns in 1968 and 1972; they were cited in Congressional debates after the Watergate scandal to institute campaign spending limits.[1]

According to Tim Weiner, in One Man Against the World: The Tragedy of Richard Nixon, in 1972 President Nixon’s lawyer, Herbert Kalmbach, helped raise money for Nixon’s presidential campaign by selling ambassadorships to large donors, including “W. Clement Stone, [who] pledged $3 million." Stone wanted to become ambassador to Great Britain, "which already was occupied by Ambassador Walter Annenberg, who gave $254,000 in order to stay on” (p. 160).
Stone associated with Napoleon Hill to teach the Philosophy of Personal Achievement “Science of Success" course. Stone wrote: "One of the most important days in my life was the day I began to read Think and Grow Rich in 1937.[6][7] Stone said that the Bible was “the world's greatest self-help book".[8]
In the last interview before his death, Stone explained the importance of PMA (Positive Mental Attitude): "A positive mental attitude is necessary for achieving worthwhile success. We in America know what it is for us, for we have inherited the tenets of the Judeo-Christian faiths on which our Constitution, laws and customs have been based.... Strive to understand and apply the Golden Rule.... Believe that any goal that doesn’t violate the laws of God or the rights of your fellow men can be achieved...". Recalled M.L. Harris: "I attended one of the PMA rallies in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1976. I'll never forget Stone, the MC of the event; and how he leapt on the stage, grabbed the microphone and shouted: I feel healthy! I feel happy! I feel terrific! It gave me goosebumps. At the time, he was 74 years old; and possessed the energy of a man in his thirties." ~ M.L. Harris, author.[4]
Stone died on September 3, 2002 in Evanston, Illinois.[1]
Books[edit]

Stone emphasized using a "positive mental attitude" to succeed.[1] Stone adopted the motto of his mentor, Napoleon Hill, "Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve (with PMA)."[9] In 1960, Stone teamed up with Napoleon Hill to author Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude.[10] The book Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude includes the following testimonial from the Rev. Robert H. Schuller on the inside front cover page: "Success Through A Positive Mental Attitude is one of the ten books that has most impacted my faith and my philosophy...no person's education is complete without the concepts articulated in it so wisely and so well."[11] Norman Vincent Peale said that Stone and Hill "have the rare gift of inspiring and helping people...In fact, I owe them both a personal debt of gratitude for the helpful guidance I have received from their writings."[12] Stone and Hill also founded a monthly digest magazine, entitled Success Unlimited.[7] In 1962, Stone wrote the Success System That Never Fails, in which he suggested how to become successful and have a healthy, productive lifestyle.[13] In 1964, he and Norma Lee Browning collaborated on writing The Other Side of the Mind.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stone gave over $275 million to charity including civic groups, mental health and Christian organizations.[1][4] Stone was once quoted as saying, "All I want to do is change the world".[1]
Among his philanthropic activities were his long-time support of the Boys Clubs of America (now Boys and Girls Clubs of America), and the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. The Stone Student Center was dedicated on June 24, 1967 on the campus of the Interlochen Center for the Arts. Stone donated one million dollars to Rev. Dr. Robert H. Schuller to begin construction on the Crystal Cathedral. The W. Clement and Jessie V. Stone Foundation was established by Stone and his wife to support humanitarian, mental health, religious and community causes. In 2009 the Foundation gave $3,805,625 to worthwhile causes.[15] The foundation also gives college scholarships; one of the beneficiaries is the demographer, pollster, and political pundit Elliott Stonecipher of Shreveport, Louisiana, who entered the "Boy of the Year" competition in the late 1960s at the national Boys Clubs competition.
Stone was a supporter of The Napoleon Hill Foundation, which he directed for forty years, and to which his estate contributes funding.[4][7] Stone celebrated his 100th birthday with a gift of $100,000 to the University of Illinois at Chicago.[8]
Stone provided much of the initial funding for the self-help organization, GROW.[16] Stone was inducted into the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, and was a Freemason.[17]
W. Clement Stone once stated, “Regardless of what you are or what you have been, you can still become what you may want to be.”[4]

The forums were created by Stone to educate aspiring business owners in Chicago.
In 1919, Stone built the Combined Insurance Company of America, which provided both accident and health insurance coverage; by 1930, he had over 1000 agents selling insurance for him across the United States.[2] By 1979, his insurance company exceeded $1 billion in assets. Combined later merged with the Ryan Insurance Group to form Aon Corporation in 1987.,[2] and Combined was later spun off by Aon to ACE Limited in April 2008 for $2.56 billion.[5]
Stone contributed up to $10 million to President Richard Nixon's election campaigns in 1968 and 1972; they were cited in Congressional debates after the Watergate scandal to institute campaign spending limits.[1]

According to Tim Weiner, in One Man Against the World: The Tragedy of Richard Nixon, in 1972 President Nixon’s lawyer, Herbert Kalmbach, helped raise money for Nixon’s presidential campaign by selling ambassadorships to large donors, including “W. Clement Stone, [who] pledged $3 million." Stone wanted to become ambassador to Great Britain, "which already was occupied by Ambassador Walter Annenberg, who gave $254,000 in order to stay on” (p. 160).
Stone associated with Napoleon Hill to teach the Philosophy of Personal Achievement “Science of Success" course. Stone wrote: "One of the most important days in my life was the day I began to read Think and Grow Rich in 1937.[6][7] Stone said that the Bible was “the world's greatest self-help book".[8]
In the last interview before his death, Stone explained the importance of PMA (Positive Mental Attitude): "A positive mental attitude is necessary for achieving worthwhile success. We in America know what it is for us, for we have inherited the tenets of the Judeo-Christian faiths on which our Constitution, laws and customs have been based.... Strive to understand and apply the Golden Rule.... Believe that any goal that doesn’t violate the laws of God or the rights of your fellow men can be achieved...". Recalled M.L. Harris: "I attended one of the PMA rallies in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1976. I'll never forget Stone, the MC of the event; and how he leapt on the stage, grabbed the microphone and shouted: I feel healthy! I feel happy! I feel terrific! It gave me goosebumps. At the time, he was 74 years old; and possessed the energy of a man in his thirties." ~ M.L. Harris, author.[4]
Stone died on September 3, 2002 in Evanston, Illinois.[1]

Stone emphasized using a "positive mental attitude" to succeed.[1] Stone adopted the motto of his mentor, Napoleon Hill, "Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve (with PMA)."[9] In 1960, Stone teamed up with Napoleon Hill to author Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude.[10] The book Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude includes the following testimonial from the Rev. Robert H. Schuller on the inside front cover page: "Success Through A Positive Mental Attitude is one of the ten books that has most impacted my faith and my philosophy...no person's education is complete without the concepts articulated in it so wisely and so well."[11] Norman Vincent Peale said that Stone and Hill "have the rare gift of inspiring and helping people...In fact, I owe them both a personal debt of gratitude for the helpful guidance I have received from their writings."[12] Stone and Hill also founded a monthly digest magazine, entitled Success Unlimited.[7] In 1962, Stone wrote the Success System That Never Fails, in which he suggested how to become successful and have a healthy, productive lifestyle.[13] In 1964, he and Norma Lee Browning collaborated on writing The Other Side of the Mind.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stone gave over $275 million to charity including civic groups, mental health and Christian organizations.[1][4] Stone was once quoted as saying, "All I want to do is change the world".[1]
Among his philanthropic activities were his long-time support of the Boys Clubs of America (now Boys and Girls Clubs of America), and the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. The Stone Student Center was dedicated on June 24, 1967 on the campus of the Interlochen Center for the Arts. Stone donated one million dollars to Rev. Dr. Robert H. Schuller to begin construction on the Crystal Cathedral. The W. Clement and Jessie V. Stone Foundation was established by Stone and his wife to support humanitarian, mental health, religious and community causes. In 2009 the Foundation gave $3,805,625 to worthwhile causes.[15] The foundation also gives college scholarships; one of the beneficiaries is the demographer, pollster, and political pundit Elliott Stonecipher of Shreveport, Louisiana, who entered the "Boy of the Year" competition in the late 1960s at the national Boys Clubs competition.
Stone was a supporter of The Napoleon Hill Foundation, which he directed for forty years, and to which his estate contributes funding.[4][7] Stone celebrated his 100th birthday with a gift of $100,000 to the University of Illinois at Chicago.[8]
Stone provided much of the initial funding for the self-help organization, GROW.[16] Stone was inducted into the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, and was a Freemason.[17]
W. Clement Stone once stated, “Regardless of what you are or what you have been, you can still become what you may want to be.”[4]

Biography[edit]
He was born in Chicago, Illinois on May 4, 1902. His father died in 1905 leaving his family in debt. In 1908 he hawked newspapers on the South Side of Chicago while his mother worked as a dressmaker. By 1915 he owned his own newsstand. In 1918 he moved to Detroit to sell casualty insurance for his mother.[1]
Stone dropped out of high school to sell insurance full-time. He received a diploma from the YMCA Central High School in Chicago. He took courses at Detroit College of Law and Northwestern University.[1]
Much of what is known about Stone comes from his autobiography The Success System That Never Fails.[2] In that book, he tells of his early business life, which started with selling newspapers in restaurants. At the time, this was a novel thing to do, a departure from the typical practice of boys hawking newspapers on street corners.
At first, restaurant managers of restaurants tried to discourage him, but he gradually won them over by his politeness, charm, persistence and the fact that most restaurant patrons had no objection to this new way of selling papers.
From there, he graduated to selling insurance policies in downtown business offices. His mother managed his new career and together they were very successful.
Stone ran $100 into millions with his strong desire to succeed and by putting into practice the principles outlined in the well-known self-help book, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.[1][3][4]
Stone was a living example of the proverbial rags-to-riches protagonist in the Horatio Alger's stories he loved. Eventually he became an 'angel' to others, lifting some from the gutter to the heights of success. One of his great success stories was Og Mandino, an alcoholic whom Stone took under his wing. The relationship led to a new life for Mandino, who became the publisher of Success Magazine. In 1978, Stone met an aggressive young securities broker named Christopher Nolan and recruited him as his Director of Education for the Entrepreneurship Forums. The forums were created by Stone to educate aspiring business owners in Chicago.

In 1919, Stone built the Combined Insurance Company of America, which provided both accident and health insurance coverage; by 1930, he had over 1000 agents selling insurance for him across the United States.[2] By 1979, his insurance company exceeded $1 billion in assets. Combined later merged with the Ryan Insurance Group to form Aon Corporation in 1987.,[2] and Combined was later spun off by Aon to ACE Limited in April 2008 for $2.56 billion.[5]
Stone contributed up to $10 million to President Richard Nixon's election campaigns in 1968 and 1972; they were cited in Congressional debates after the Watergate scandal to institute campaign spending limits.[1]

According to Tim Weiner, in One Man Against the World: The Tragedy of Richard Nixon, in 1972 President Nixon’s lawyer, Herbert Kalmbach, helped raise money for Nixon’s presidential campaign by selling ambassadorships to large donors, including “W. Clement Stone, [who] pledged $3 million." Stone wanted to become ambassador to Great Britain, "which already was occupied by Ambassador Walter Annenberg, who gave $254,000 in order to stay on” (p. 160).
Stone associated with Napoleon Hill to teach the Philosophy of Personal Achievement “Science of Success" course. Stone wrote: "One of the most important days in my life was the day I began to read Think and Grow Rich in 1937.[6][7] Stone said that the Bible was “the world's greatest self-help book".[8]
In the last interview before his death, Stone explained the importance of PMA (Positive Mental Attitude): "A positive mental attitude is necessary for achieving worthwhile success. We in America know what it is for us, for we have inherited the tenets of the Judeo-Christian faiths on which our Constitution, laws and customs have been based.... Strive to understand and apply the Golden Rule.... Believe that any goal that doesn’t violate the laws of God or the rights of your fellow men can be achieved...". Recalled M.L. Harris: "I attended one of the PMA rallies in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1976. I'll never forget Stone, the MC of the event; and how he leapt on the stage, grabbed the microphone and shouted: I feel healthy! I feel happy! I feel terrific! It gave me goosebumps. At the time, he was 74 years old; and possessed the energy of a man in his thirties." ~ M.L. Harris, author.[4]
Stone died on September 3, 2002 in Evanston, Illinois.[1]
Books[edit]

Stone emphasized using a "positive mental attitude" to succeed.[1] Stone adopted the motto of his mentor, Napoleon Hill, "Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve (with PMA)."[9] In 1960, Stone teamed up with Napoleon Hill to author Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude.[10] The book Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude includes the following testimonial from the Rev. Robert H. Schuller on the inside front cover page: "Success Through A Positive Mental Attitude is one of the ten books that has most impacted my faith and my philosophy...no person's education is complete without the concepts articulated in it so wisely and so well."[11] Norman Vincent Peale said that Stone and Hill "have the rare gift of inspiring and helping people...In fact, I owe them both a personal debt of gratitude for the helpful guidance I have received from their writings."[12] Stone and Hill also founded a monthly digest magazine, entitled Success Unlimited.[7] In 1962, Stone wrote the Success System That Never Fails, in which he suggested how to become successful and have a healthy, productive lifestyle.[13] In 1964, he and Norma Lee Browning collaborated on writing The Other Side of the Mind.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stone gave over $275 million to charity including civic groups, mental health and Christian organizations.[1][4] Stone was once quoted as saying, "All I want to do is change the world".[1]
Among his philanthropic activities were his long-time support of the Boys Clubs of America (now Boys and Girls Clubs of America), and the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. The Stone Student Center was dedicated on June 24, 1967 on the campus of the Interlochen Center for the Arts. Stone donated one million dollars to Rev. Dr. Robert H. Schuller to begin construction on the Crystal Cathedral. The W. Clement and Jessie V. Stone Foundation was established by Stone and his wife to support humanitarian, mental health, religious and community causes. In 2009 the Foundation gave $3,805,625 to worthwhile causes.[15] The foundation also gives college scholarships; one of the beneficiaries is the demographer, pollster, and political pundit Elliott Stonecipher of Shreveport, Louisiana, who entered the "Boy of the Year" competition in the late 1960s at the national Boys Clubs competition.
Stone was a supporter of The Napoleon Hill Foundation, which he directed for forty years, and to which his estate contributes funding.[4][7] Stone celebrated his 100th birthday with a gift of $100,000 to the University of Illinois at Chicago.[8]
Stone provided much of the initial funding for the self-help organization, GROW.[16] Stone was inducted into the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, and was a Freemason.[17]
W. Clement Stone once stated, “Regardless of what you are or what you have been, you can still become what you may want to be.”[4]

Being Urban examines the dynamic interplay between what theoretical perceptions tell us about urban life and how ordinary people interpret and respond to the actual experience of living in cities. A major focus of inquiry is the strategies people use to create community in an environment where, many theorists believe, only alienation and progressive disintegration are possible. In the second edition of this important work, the authors have expanded their commitment to interdisciplinary perspectives and have also included chapters on significant topics that have been largely neglected in urban sociology.Part I provides a review of the themes of urban sociology developed by nineteenth-century classic theorists and early American social scientists. In Part II, the authors look at selected aspects of everyday city life, including the bases of community, the primacy of social interaction for an understanding of urban life, and conditions that produce the breakdown of urban tolerance for diversity of cultures and lifestyles. A new chapter in Part II studies women's experiences in cities. Part III explores institutional structures of urban life and broad patterns of cultural change, including a fascinating chapter on the distribution of power, stratification, and class structure in cities. Included in Part III is another new chapter, analyzing the role of sports in urban life. The final chapter discusses urban life in the postindustrial era, and the demographic, cultural, and historical factors that lie behind the ongoing transformation of American cities. This new edition offers a balanced treatment that avoids the anti-urban bias characteristic of much that has been written on the subject. Being Urban is appropriate for professionals and academics concerned with urban life, as well as for courses in urban sociology.

Reviews/Endorsements
ReviewsI welcome the (second edition) of Being Urban and hope it will continue to introduce students to the dynamic character of social interaction in cities and the active role of individuals in constructing their urban social worlds. Karp, Stone, and Yoels light the path, now it is up to us...to explore the way.—Symbolic Interaction
