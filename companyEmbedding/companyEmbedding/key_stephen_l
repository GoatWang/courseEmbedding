If you have an idea for a new product, you need to start your own business to bring it to market, right?
Wrong! 
Not everyone has the experience, time, money or even desire to start a business.
There is an alternative. It's called licensing.
You do not have to write a business plan, source manufacturing, develop a marketing strategy, spend money on advertising, or find distribution. 
With licensing, you can simply ‘rent’ your idea to a company and receive royalties in return. In other words, create a flow of passive income! 
The benefits of licensing are many. One of the biggest is that it requires little to no financial risk. You do not have to raise capital or quit your day job. You can focus on being creative and developing more products rather then the day-to-day details of running a business.
Licensing is also the fastest way to market. When you leverage the power of a Fortune 500 company that has shelf space in place already, you win.Let Us Show You How To License Your Product Ideas!inventRight helps people bring their ideas to market faster and far more cost-effectively than the traditional business model you’re familiar with, aka venturing.   
Instead, we teach our students how to apply the simple 10 step process created by Stephen Key and Andrew Krauss and introduced in their book: One Simple Idea: How to Turn Your Product Idea Into a Licensing Goldmine.
Here’s why you should join us!

You don’t have to do this alone, you will have the support of a team.

A personal coach will guide you for six months, follow up on your progress, and mentor you through our 10 step program.
Experts (such as patent attorneys) and successful inventors teach weekly webinars and answer questions on all of the ten steps.
The entire inventRight community is available for questions and answers through our members-only forum.


You don’t have to spend a lot of time; you will learn how to move quickly. If you follow our coaches’ advice you can have your product in front of a company in 60 days!

Identify the right companies to submit your products.
Get your product in front of the right people for evaluation.
Make powerful selling tools quickly (sell sheets and videos). In fact, your first sell sheet is free through our Design Studio.


You don’t have to spend a lot of money; you will learn to do many things yourself. Let our coaches teach you the shortcuts.

Make your own powerful selling tools using a computer and a Smartphone.
Write unlimited Provisional Patent Applications using SmartIP – protecting your idea while saving thousands of dollars of legal expense.
Negotiate your own licensing contract with our step by step coaching – getting the deal you want while saving thousands on attorney fees.

What Makes Us Different?
We teach you the skills you need to succeed in any marketplace.Our Story
In 2000, Stephen Key and Andrew Krauss discovered they had one thing in common; they realized there were not enough reliable options and resources available to inventors and entrepreneurs with new product ideas. Together, they started inventRight with the goal of doing things differently. While others offered a gamble on "We'll do it for you", the inventRight mission was to empower product developers by teaching them how to license their own products. Today inventRight has grown into a vibrant community that embodies those same values. inventRight’s team of coaches, along with our founders, are here to help you at every step. At inventRight, your success is our success, and we offer you the information, resources, and support you need to realize your goals.About One-on-One CoachingOur coaches have more experience than anyone in the industry and your success is our first priority. Whether you need a lifeline when you hit a roadblock with your product, or want a mentor you can work with, our coaches are there with the knowledge and expertise you need to turn your idea into a reality. Our innovative approach to licensing is designed to bring your idea to market while reducing unnecessary out-of-pocket costs.   The inventRight approach to licensing reduces legal fees, can save you money on patent applications, and guides you through negotiations all while providing you with a full-time consultant. When you begin the program, your coach will evaluate your idea and provide the best strategy for you. Once you find your potential licensee, Stephen Key and Senior Licensing Coach David Fedewa will step in to provide professional guidance and ensure that you get the licensing deal you want. We care about every student. Our personal touch, along with the support of the entire inventRight community, is what helps our students to be so successful.Our Mission: Help you bring your ideas to market and get the best deal possible.Is inventRight a Good Fit For You?
We coach students who have already brought products to market as well as total beginners. Many of our students come to us and have already begun developing their idea, meaning they’ve started or completed the patent process or have already tried to venture on their own. Others come to us with just an idea and the ambition to bring it to market. Our team of coaches has a diverse background and is designed to allow you to develop your idea at any stage in the process. Our students are located in over 40 countries across the globe. Listen to some of their stories here.
While we have helped people from all over the world bring ideas to market in a wide variety of industries, the inventRight one-on-one coaching program isn’t for everyone. We want to work with people we know we can help, and are committed to investing in our students. Like all good relationships, it’s a two-way street! We want you to be as committed to both the program and your ideas as we are. Your success is our success!Co-Founders Stephen Key and Andrew Krauss discuss why you should join the inventRight One-On-One Coaching Program in the series of videos below.











 New Services Available To Our StudentsClick the images above to learn more!Students In Over 40 CountriesWith students in over 40 countries participation is not limited to residents of the United States. We are often asked, “Does this work outside of the United States? Can I participate in your program if I live outside of the U.S.?” Our answer is always: Absolutely!
Open innovation is thriving worldwide. Licensing is a global opportunity and you are invited to participate. Our international students work on filing and licensing their intellectual property in the United States before moving forward with licensing intellectual property in the country they reside.We work with our students the same way no matter where they are located across the globe: Via phone and online communication, email, and our easy-to-use coaching session booking system. Time zones are not an issue. 
The inventRight one-on-one coaching program has helped students from all corners of the world! We have had the privilege of working with students in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, France, Zimbabwe, and dozens of others.
Stephen has had the pleasure of being invited to speak about licensing and the inventRight one-on-one coaching program in Australia and Northern Ireland. He always looks forward to sharing his knowledge with other people.

What do you really need to intrigue a potential licensee? We will teach you how to create powerful, effective sell sheets as well as short promotional videos — the tool our students are increasingly utilizing with great success. These tools will do the selling communicate your products uses, benefits and value. They make it so you don’t have to be a pitchman. Really, you’re just delivering a package — a package that effectively does the selling for you.Learn how to write a provisional patent application. By watching the video trainings done by attorney Damon Kali, you will learn how to start licensing your own PPAs. Filing intellectual property can get expensive, quick. Learning how to file PPAs that have value and stop workarounds on your own has the potential to save you anywhere from $1,500-$3,000 if not much more. Once you file a PPA ($65) you have the right to mark your product “patent pending”.Negotiate contracts. After negotiating countless agreements on behalf of his students (as well as his own), Stephen knows what to look out for. He has passed down his invaluable insight to Senior Licensing Coach David. When you’re close to cutting a deal, David will help you evaluate it and determine whether or not it’s the right deal for you. You will learn the ins and outs of contract language, including minimum guarantees, royalty rates, term sheets, and important clauses to ensure you get the best deal possible. And, believe it or not, once you experience a few deals with David guiding you, you’ll get it — you’ll be able to tackle negotiations, the most difficult part of licensing, on your own.Flat Fee. The inventRight one-on-one coaching program is designed to empower you to navigate the entire licensing process from an idea to your deal on the table. We care about the success of every student, and that’s why we don’t take a percentage of anything you make, and will never surprise you with hidden costs. The best part? What you’ve learned never goes away, and our coaches are always here if you need them.Our goal is to enable you to do every aspect of licensing on your own after your experience with us, for life! We make sure to give you the resources you need so that companies will want to work with you.

Is inventRight For You?
Maybe! We want to work with students whose needs we can meet.
If you have additional questions, please click here to set up a phone call with a member of our team. 
 
What We Do
inventRight is a yearlong one-on-one coaching program. For more specific details, visit our “Coaching” page. We are personal, intimate, and familiar. You will form a close bond with your coach. He or she will give you specific action steps for every part of the process of bringing an idea to life. You will no longer wonder what you need to do next or second-guess your next step.
When you become our student, your problems become our problems. We’re on your team.
After your year with us, our goal (other than helping you license your ideas) is that you don’t need us anymore. We want you to turn to us and say, “Thanks for helping me through those projects. I get it now! I now know how to license my ideas.”
Our program is as thorough as thorough gets. Our commitment to you is simple: To teach you everything we know about this process. And we know a lot. You will be empowered with the confidence and knowledge to execute your vision.
What We Aren’t
Make no mistake: We are not licensing agents. You keep 100% of any and every deal you make. We also don’t do your work for you.
In the same vein, we are not an invention submission company. We do not evaluate ideas in the way you may be familiar with. The only opinion that matters is the company you pitch your idea to for licensing consideration. We provide feedback, we offer insight and analysis, we give you the upsides and downsides of every project you work on, but we will not give you a ‘thumbs-up’ or ‘thumbs-down’. We will discuss the benefits and limitations of each of your ideas with you, ultimately teaching you how to do the evaluating yourself.
The best person to bring your idea to market is in fact you. We think you must become the expert. You're in control of your destiny — you and only you can do this.
Who inventRight Students Are
Lawyers, plumbers, stay-at-home parents, doctors, students, retirees, professionally trained product developers, patent holders, and complete novices succeed in our program. We’ve had students as young as seventeen and as old as 70. The U.S. Army even hired us to teach them about licensing. We field interest from national governments every now and then.
Really, anyone who has an idea and wants to learn how to bring it to market is a good fit for our program. We’re looking for self-motivated learners. People who want to invest in themselves. Maybe you’re considering a change in your career. Maybe you’re just exploring an interest in product development. If you want to see your ideas on store shelves but don’t want to start a business to get them there, licensing is for you.
 
Answering Common Questions
I’d like to be your partner.
We do not partner with inventors. When you are done with our coaching program, you will know you can do this yourself without any help. You won’t have to share your profits. We are your mentor/coach/teacher. We are not your agents or your business partners. What we do is give you complete and total support from the very inception of an idea to closing a deal. After working on several products during your year with us, we want you to say, “I get it guys. I don’t need you anymore.” We won’t be insulted! That’s the greatest compliment you could pay us.
I don’t have any money, but I have a great idea! Can you help me sell it?
Like we said, we don’t do partnerships and we don’t take commission. You can license simple ideas without spending a lot of money. For example, the cost of filing a provisional patent application with the Patent and Trademark Office is $65-$130. We will teach you how to write your own PPA — one that stops workarounds and therefore has value. We will show you how to create a fantastic-looking sell sheet for close to nothing by hiring freelance graphic designers. Many of our students need to invest just $100-$200 before they are able to start calling companies. (This is not true of all ideas, but it is true of many.) There aren’t many businesses that require such a minimal investment per product.
Our 10-step system is easy to follow. We focus on getting you to work smarter, not harder, ultimately developing a game plan that requires less money than you think you need.
I want to license my ideas, but I’m not sure I have the time.
We help you stay on track. We’ve had students spend as little as two to four hours a week bringing their ideas to market and still be successful. When your coach is keeping you laser-focused on what your next step is during your sessions, this becomes very doable. In fact, we strongly advise our students to keep their day jobs and maintain their lifestyle. You can make a lot of money licensing, but it is not a get rich quick scheme. It won’t happen overnight. Get some royalties coming in and then quit your day job if you like.
I’m tired of trying to venture my idea. Why should I try to license it?
If you have tried selling your product yourself, you’re in good shape to try licensing. You’ll be able to use the work you’ve already done — like making a good working prototype, or creating a sell sheet, or gathering sales or test data — to sell potential licensees on your idea. We show you how to leverage what you’ve already done. You probably know by now how hard it is to get new products into stores if you’ve been trying to venture and sell your idea yourself. Distribution is one of the biggest benefits of licensing. When you license an idea, your licensee is already selling products in the stores you want to be in!
Please, can you just answer this one question?
Answering your one question isn’t really going to help you. The reason? It’s never just one question! Chances are you aren’t even aware of the right questions to be asking. If we answer one question, you’ll inevitably come back with another. Our one-on-one coaching program opens our students’ eyes to the bigger picture — the benefit to you is learning how to sell your ideas while working on a real-life project. 
You’ll have less questions after you sign up because you’ll have your coach guiding you every step of the way. You can ask your coach anything, of course. But you will want to let them guide you — and then come back with questions.
What if I’m not based in the United States?
We’ve had students from more than 30 countries. You can license your idea to an American company, as well as companies around the world, from anywhere in the world. You do not need to be based in the U.S. to become an inventRight student. We love working with international students and are proud to help people around the world.
If you have additional questions, please click here to set up a phone call with a member of our team.

We believe Mr. Key's deep accounting experience, his service on the board of directors and audit committees of other public companies and his previous management experience at several public companies add significant support both to the Board of Directors and the management team in considering accounting, finance and related matters.

These 4 Industries Need Help: They Will License Your Ideas

Some industries have embraced open innovation more than others. I'm talking about industries that have an enormous appetite for new product ideas. Companies competing within these industries are very actively looking for your innovations because, to be frank, their success depends on them. As a result, they know how to work with outside product developers. They have specific policies and procedures in place. They're more likely to treat you fairly. If you want to pitch them one of your ideas, you won't even have to make a cold call to get in--you can simply use their online submission forms.
My students have had a lot of success licensing their ideas to these industries. You can too.
1. Kitchen
The kitchen industry is on fire. I mean, how many cooking shows are there on television these days? Chefs are veritable rock stars. At the same time, Americans are thinking more deeply about what they put into their bodies. Everyone from Mark Bittman to Michael Pollan is talking about how cooking at home is one of the best ways to feed yourself and your family. All of which is to say: This is a great industry to design an idea for. Gadgets that make cooking easier and cleaner are especially desirable. At Make48 in Kansas City last weekend, the challenge presented to teams of competing inventors was, "Come up with a solution to an everyday problem we face in the kitchen." Can you?
At the end of the day, everyone has to eat. If you have an idea for a kitchen product, consider contacting Warren Tuttle. He's a product scout for Lifetime Brands.
2. Pet
According to the American Pet Products Association, approximately 37-47% of all households in the United States have a dog, and 30-37% own a cat. Needless to say, we love our pets! They give us so much joy that we want to pamper and entertain them. People who are barely able to make their mortgage payments continue caring for their pets. For that reason, the pet industry continues to grow. Entrepreneurs I've met on the road tell me that the companies they approach with their pet product ideas welcome them with open arms.
3. Direct-response television
Ever heard of the Snuggie? I bet. It feels as if everywhere I turn, I run into an "As Seen on TV" display in a retail store these days. DRTV has always been a popular avenue for inventors, but these days, the industry is absolutely booming. For one, DRTV companies move fast. Someone will get back to you about your idea quickly. For that reason, I recommend submitting your idea to one company at a time. Another thing I love about this industry is that it doesn't require patents. If you happen to live in San Diego, the final days of Response Expo are going down now.
If you have an idea you think is right for DRTV, consider pitching it to Carrie Jeske at Will It Launch. 
4. DIY hardware
This has always been a great industry for inventors. Does your innovation get the job done more quickly or cheaply? You might have a winner on your hands. If you have an idea for the hardware industry, you should consider attending the National Hardware Show in Las Vegas, which is coming up in early May.
These aren't the only hot industries out there, but they're definitely among the easiest to license an idea to.
