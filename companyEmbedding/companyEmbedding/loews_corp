Annual Report









LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS


Let’s cut to the chase.
For this year’s letter, instead of comprehensively reviewing 2016, we thought we’d start by addressing the two questions we have heard most often from shareholders lately:

Why did we purchase relatively few Loews shares in 2016?
Why hasn’t Loews made an acquisition recently?

The answers to these questions illustrate our fundamental approach to creating long-term shareholder value, and the ways in which we allocate capital to achieve that goal.
In 2016 we purchased 3.4 million shares of Loews stock, or about 1% of our outstanding shares, at an average price of just under $39 per share. About 2.6 million of those shares were repurchased during the first half of the year. As the equity markets climbed to record heights during the second half of 2016, and Loews’s common stock moved along with them, we chose to exercise caution. In hindsight, we could have repurchased more of our shares early in the year, when Loews stock was trading at lower prices and the S&P 500 was well below its recent levels. Alas, it must be time to get a new crystal ball!
Unlike some companies, we do not repurchase our stock robotically or set annual repurchase quotas. Rather, we seek to buy back our stock when it’s below our estimation of its intrinsic value and when prevailing market conditions seem conducive. While we remain positive on our shares and see great potential for our subsidiaries, we did not see the wisdom of buying back shares in an exuberant equity market. We are more comfortable buying back our shares when the market is not hitting new highs. Over the span of time, measured in years and decades, we are proud of our record and we feel that our share repurchases have created significant value for our shareholders.
As for the second question, we continue to kick tires on potential acquisitions, looking for the right acquisition at the right price. Valuations in the merger market have made our search difficult and frustrating. The merger market today is being driven by large numbers of corporate buyers, as well as by private equity funds which are under pressure to put their capital to work. The abundance of private capital combined with the amount of leverage available at remarkably low rates has enabled private equity firms to pay generous prices for companies that haven’t already been gobbled up by strategic buyers.
Our focus drives us to invest only when all the pieces of a transaction — from valuation, to potential cash flow, to future industry dynamics — add up to a solid investment. To date, we have not found a potential acquisition where all the pieces fit together the way we believe they should. It’s a tough market in which to be a disciplined buyer.
That said, our liquidity gives us tremendous strategic and financial flexibility. We will never stop using our best judgment to balance risk and reward to build value for all shareholders. And we are confident that, despite today’s market exuberance, we will find desirable opportunities in the future.


 









                    ANNUAL REPORT
                


Loews’s assets currently consist of three publicly-traded subsidiaries: CNA Financial, Diamond Offshore Drilling, and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners; and Loews Hotels, a wholly owned subsidiary; as well as a large portfolio of cash and investments.
Our unique structure gives us the freedom to make investments and acquisitions across a broad spectrum of industries, wherever we see opportunity.

History[edit]




Old Loews logo


Loews Corporation traces its roots to 1946, when Laurence Tisch persuaded his parents to invest $125,000 to buy a resort hotel in Lakewood, N.J. Laurence’s brother Robert joined the business shortly thereafter. The Tisch brothers began to invest their profits in an expanding hotel business. By 1956, the brothers were in a position to build their first hotel, the Americana in Bal Harbour, Fla., for $17 million in cash.[5]
In 1959, the brothers purchased a controlling interest in Loew's Theatres, Inc., a nationwide chain of 102 movie theaters, which formed the foundation of modern-day Loews (Loews sold the theater business in 1985). The two founders developed a conservative and flexible value-oriented philosophy which continues to be a cornerstone of Loews today.
The Tisch brothers soon diversified the Loews business, successfully venturing into a variety of areas as the 1960s and 1970s progressed. Loews acquired Lorillard, a tobacco company, in 1968; CNA Financial in 1974, and the Bulova Watch Company in 1979. Through acquisitions, Loews' revenues grew from $100 million in 1970 to more than $3 billion by a decade later.
Laurence Tisch briefly owned, through Loews, a significant portion of U.S. television and radio broadcaster CBS in the 1980s. As Chairman of CBS, he also approved the deal that brought late night host David Letterman to the network from NBC.[6] Loews involvement in CBS ended in 1995, with the sale of CBS to Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $5.4 billion.
In the past two decades, Loews further diversified into the energy business. In 1989, the company acquired Diamond M Drilling. The subsidiary acquired ODECO in 1992, adding 39 rigs. A year later, the combined businesses were renamed Diamond Offshore. The operating subsidiary, which went public in 1995, provides contract drilling services to the energy industry globally.[7]

History[edit]




Old Loews logo


Loews Corporation traces its roots to 1946, when Laurence Tisch persuaded his parents to invest $125,000 to buy a resort hotel in Lakewood, N.J. Laurence’s brother Robert joined the business shortly thereafter. The Tisch brothers began to invest their profits in an expanding hotel business. By 1956, the brothers were in a position to build their first hotel, the Americana in Bal Harbour, Fla., for $17 million in cash.[5]
In 1959, the brothers purchased a controlling interest in Loew's Theatres, Inc., a nationwide chain of 102 movie theaters, which formed the foundation of modern-day Loews (Loews sold the theater business in 1985). The two founders developed a conservative and flexible value-oriented philosophy which continues to be a cornerstone of Loews today.
The Tisch brothers soon diversified the Loews business, successfully venturing into a variety of areas as the 1960s and 1970s progressed. Loews acquired Lorillard, a tobacco company, in 1968; CNA Financial in 1974, and the Bulova Watch Company in 1979. Through acquisitions, Loews' revenues grew from $100 million in 1970 to more than $3 billion by a decade later.
Laurence Tisch briefly owned, through Loews, a significant portion of U.S. television and radio broadcaster CBS in the 1980s. As Chairman of CBS, he also approved the deal that brought late night host David Letterman to the network from NBC.[6] Loews involvement in CBS ended in 1995, with the sale of CBS to Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $5.4 billion.
In the past two decades, Loews further diversified into the energy business. In 1989, the company acquired Diamond M Drilling. The subsidiary acquired ODECO in 1992, adding 39 rigs. A year later, the combined businesses were renamed Diamond Offshore. The operating subsidiary, which went public in 1995, provides contract drilling services to the energy industry globally.[7]
In 2003, Loews purchased Texas Gas Transmission, LLC and, a year later, bought Gulf South Pipeline Company. These two companies were consolidated into a new entity, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, which went public in 2005. Structured as a midstream master limited partnership (“MLP”), Boardwalk Pipeline provides transportation, storage, gathering and processing of natural gas and liquids for its customers.[8]
On May 10, 2006 Loews Corporation announced that it would offer 15 million shares of Carolina Group via a public offering, with the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes.[9] The sale's value was $740 million.
Loews Corporation was the parent company of Bulova Watches until 2007, when it sold the company to Tokyo-based Citizen Holdings Co.[10]
On June 4, 2007 Loews Corporation announced it would acquire a portion of the operations of Dominion Resources for 4.025 billion dollars.[11] Loews rebranded the assets HighMount Exploration & Production LLC. This wholly owned subsidiary is engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas and natural gas liquids.[12] On May 23, 2014, Loews announced that HighMount is pursuing strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of business. HighMont was sold later that year to the private equity firm EnerVest.[13]
On December 17, 2007, Loews Corporation announced a plan to spin off its entire ownership interest in its subsidiary, Lorillard, Inc., to holders of Carolina Group stock and Loews common stock.[14]
In 2009, the corporation marked the 50th anniversary of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

History[edit]




Old Loews logo


Loews Corporation traces its roots to 1946, when Laurence Tisch persuaded his parents to invest $125,000 to buy a resort hotel in Lakewood, N.J. Laurence’s brother Robert joined the business shortly thereafter. The Tisch brothers began to invest their profits in an expanding hotel business. By 1956, the brothers were in a position to build their first hotel, the Americana in Bal Harbour, Fla., for $17 million in cash.[5]
In 1959, the brothers purchased a controlling interest in Loew's Theatres, Inc., a nationwide chain of 102 movie theaters, which formed the foundation of modern-day Loews (Loews sold the theater business in 1985). The two founders developed a conservative and flexible value-oriented philosophy which continues to be a cornerstone of Loews today.
The Tisch brothers soon diversified the Loews business, successfully venturing into a variety of areas as the 1960s and 1970s progressed. Loews acquired Lorillard, a tobacco company, in 1968; CNA Financial in 1974, and the Bulova Watch Company in 1979. Through acquisitions, Loews' revenues grew from $100 million in 1970 to more than $3 billion by a decade later.
Laurence Tisch briefly owned, through Loews, a significant portion of U.S. television and radio broadcaster CBS in the 1980s. As Chairman of CBS, he also approved the deal that brought late night host David Letterman to the network from NBC.[6] Loews involvement in CBS ended in 1995, with the sale of CBS to Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $5.4 billion.
In the past two decades, Loews further diversified into the energy business. In 1989, the company acquired Diamond M Drilling. The subsidiary acquired ODECO in 1992, adding 39 rigs. A year later, the combined businesses were renamed Diamond Offshore. The operating subsidiary, which went public in 1995, provides contract drilling services to the energy industry globally.[7]
In 2003, Loews purchased Texas Gas Transmission, LLC and, a year later, bought Gulf South Pipeline Company. These two companies were consolidated into a new entity, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, which went public in 2005. Structured as a midstream master limited partnership (“MLP”), Boardwalk Pipeline provides transportation, storage, gathering and processing of natural gas and liquids for its customers.[8]
On May 10, 2006 Loews Corporation announced that it would offer 15 million shares of Carolina Group via a public offering, with the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes.[9] The sale's value was $740 million.
Loews Corporation was the parent company of Bulova Watches until 2007, when it sold the company to Tokyo-based Citizen Holdings Co.[10]
On June 4, 2007 Loews Corporation announced it would acquire a portion of the operations of Dominion Resources for 4.025 billion dollars.[11] Loews rebranded the assets HighMount Exploration & Production LLC. This wholly owned subsidiary is engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas and natural gas liquids.[12] On May 23, 2014, Loews announced that HighMount is pursuing strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of business. HighMont was sold later that year to the private equity firm EnerVest.[13]
On December 17, 2007, Loews Corporation announced a plan to spin off its entire ownership interest in its subsidiary, Lorillard, Inc., to holders of Carolina Group stock and Loews common stock.[14]
In 2009, the corporation marked the 50th anniversary of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
Management[edit]
Founders Laurence and Robert Tisch served as co-CEOs until 1998, when they retired as part of a generational shift in corporate leadership. That year, James Tisch was named President and CEO, and the Office of the President was created with three members: James Tisch, Andrew Tisch and Jonathan Tisch. In 2006,Jonathan Tisch and Andrew Tisch were elected Co-Chairmen of the Board. Tisch family members have disclosed a 21% ownership stake in Loews Corp. The company has issued only a single class of common stock and all shareholders have equal voting rights.[15] Other senior officers include David B. Edelson, Chief Financial Officer and Sr. VP, Richard W. Scott Chief Investment Officer and Sr. VP, Gary W. Garson, Secretary and General Counsel and Sr. VP, and Kenneth I. Siegel, Sr. Vice President.
Governance[edit]
The current members of the board of directors of Loews Corporation are Lawrence S. Bacow, Ann E. Berman, Joseph L. Bower, Charles M. Diker, Jacob A. Frenkel, Paul J. Fribourg, Walter L. Harris, Philip A. Laskawy, Ken Miller, Anthony Welters, Andrew H. Tisch, James S. Tisch and Jonathan M. Tisch.
Restatement[edit]
On February 13, 2003, the Company restated its financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001 to 2000 as well as its interim financial statements for the first three quarters of 2002 to reflect an adjustment to the Company's historical accounting for CNA's investment in life settlement contracts and the related revenue recognition.[16] On March 19, 2003, the company announced a revision to its previously reported fourth quarter and year-end 2002 results to reflect an additional $28.9 million of impairment losses on equity securities at the Company's CNA Financial Corporation subsidiary.[17] On February 16, 2006, The company restated results from 2001 through September 2005 to correct accounting for discontinued operations acquired in CNA's merger with the Continental Corp. in 1995.[18] On March 8, 2006, the company said that financial statements for periods from 2001 to 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005 shouldn't be relied on because of accounting classification errors at its majority-owned subsidiary CNA Financial Corp, and it would restate financial statements for 2003 and 2004 and for the first three quarters of 2005 to correct the classification errors.[19]

Each one of our distinctive, tasteful hotels is a true original, designed to reflect the flavor of its unique location. In Tucson, a majestic adobe structure with rustic rock lobby awaits. In Miami, it’s about an Art Deco feel and the gentle rustle of coconut palms. Travel to Santa Monica and you’ll be treated to views of the sparkling Pacific while you sip cocktails poolside. The fact is, no two properties are alike. What is constant is a welcoming atmosphere, the thrill of the unexplored, and the chance to do everything—or nothing at all.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
