The
Trustworthiness of Young Joseph Smith
by Richard Lloyd Anderson 



The Improvement Era,
Vol 73, Number 10 (October 1970) 








Page 82
Two parents, five brothers, and three sisters of the Prophet Joseph
Smith were living at the time of the coming of Moroni, and each became a devout believer
in the reality of the revelations.  They comprise a virtual jury qualified to
evaluate the consistency of Joseph's early story and his personal believability in telling
it.  Without dissent, these eleven gave total acceptance.
The first person to believe in the angel's coming was the Prophet's
father.  The Prophet went to the field the morning after the triple vision of
instruction, but physical exhaustion prevented his working.  As he was leaving the
field, the angel appeared to reiterate his message, "and commanded me to go to my
father and tell him of the vision and commandments which I had received."1  Lucy Mack Smith added a detail
likely to have been remembered by a parent--that the angel was actually requesting an
explanation for Joseph's not following prior instructions to report the visions to his
father.  Joseph's answer was that he feared his father's skepticism; however,
"the angel rejoined, 'He will believe every word you say to him.'"2  One manuscript account adds
vividness to the event. In an 1835 conversation, the Prophet recalled the moment when he
first informed his father of the angel's visit: "The old man wept, and told me that
it was a vision from God, and to attend it."3
Joseph Smith, Sr., was the patriarch of his family, and in at least
one family gathering voiced for all a complete faith in his son's visions.  In 1834
the Smith family and a few Church leaders gathered to receive their blessings from Joseph
Smith Sr., the appointed Patriarch to the Church.  In an informal service preceding
this semi-private meeting, the Prophet's father reviewed the "many afflictions"
of the family, including some deaths, particularly that of the beloved Alvin, "taken
from us in the vigor of life, in the bloom of youth."4  The Patriarch was expressing the intimate feelings
of his entire family.
His remarks were followed by prayer and then the initial blessing,
given to Joseph Smith, Jr.  The opening words reviewed the experiences now accepted
by the family that had known the Prophet from boyhood:  "The Lord thy God has
called thee by name out of the heavens; thou hast heard his voice from on high from time
to time, even in thy youth."5

The process by which this family acquired such profound conviction
can be reconstructed through the detailed writings of the mother and younger brother of
the Prophet.  These two present significantly different points of view.
 Certainly no one knew Joseph Smith, Jr., more intimately than his mother.  But
for all of her faith in God and the calling of her son, she resists the temptation to
glorify his every act.  For instance, she begins her story of the early visions with
the admission that she had told little about the youth of the Prophet.  "Some of
my readers will be disappointed,' she acknowledges, since leading questions had been
repeatedly put to her about supposed "remarkable incidents" of his
childhood:  "but, as nothing occurred during his early life except those trivial
circumstances which are common to that state of human existence, I pass them in
silence."6
 Such realism argues well for Lucy Mack Smith's honesty in the remaining record of
her son.
The memoirs of William Smith nicely supplement those of the mother.
 One sees Joseph Smith through very feminine, the other through very masculine eyes.
 Moreover, the confidence of the mother is balanced by the more detached point of
view of the brother.  In this case, the brother is the most spiritually skeptical of
all of the Smith family.  His later religious history proves a lifelong
rebelliousness, tempered only by older years.
At the time of Joseph Smith's visions, Hyrum and Samuel H. Smith had
followed their mother into the Presbyterian Church, while most other family members were
religious yet aloof from organized religion.  William, however, describes himself as
not even religious.  Family worship "often became irksome or tiresome to
me," he writes


Page 83
of this early period; he paid "no attention to religion of any
kind. . . ."  Only a powerful experience could unite this religiously divided
family, and Lucy Mack Smith and William represented opposite poles.
Carelessly quoting William Smith is an irresponsible procedure.
 He published rather detailed recollections of his youth in 1883.7  He also wrote detailed comments
on the published stories about the Prophet about 1875.8  Besides this, access to William's memory is gained
mainly through an interview of 1841,9
a speech of 1884,10 and
an interview of 1893.11
 These five basic sources for William Smith show a historical method that resembles
his religious career, spontaneous and not highly organized.  Sequence is not as
important to him as making his point with a random illustration.  One must be aware
of these characteristics because he does not relate the first vision of his brother.
 That is understandable, first of all, because he was barely nine when it took place.
 Furthermore, speaking of later visions, he indicated firm belief but carelessness:
 "being young and naturally high-spirited, I did not realize the importance of
such things as I should have done...."12
 Memory depends on deep interest.  William, therefore, writes impressionistic
history, recalling accurately his basic feelings of a time while often only approximating
details.  In this matter, he is his own best critic, for more than once he alerts the
reader that Joseph Smith's story is more precise than his own:  "A more
elaborate and accurate description of his vision, however, will be found in his own
history."13
Through the recollections of Lucy Mack and William Smith, the clock
can be turned back to the day when Joseph announced Moroni's coming to the family.
 As discussed, the stripling prophet first confided this news to his father in the
field.  Of course, Lucy Smith was not there, but from family knowledge she reported
that on that morning Alvin noticed an unusual slackness in Joseph's work and that
"Joseph was very pale."14
 William confirmed this episode from firsthand knowledge:  "I was at work
in the field together with Joseph and my eldest brother Alvin.  Joseph looked pale
and unwell."15
The most dramatic moment that day for the family circle was Joseph's
narration to them of his visions of the night before.  William places this event
prior to Joseph's going to the hill, and Mother Smith afterwards.  Yet both could be
right.  Possibly Joseph gave an announcement before and a detailed report afterwards.
 As to the family's reaction, there is no doubt.  Lucy Mack Smith describes the
intense interest of Alvin and "the most profound attention" of the entire family
at Joseph's first reports of what had happened to him.  William also described the
family's reaction to Joseph's explanations:  "They were astounded, but not
altogether incredulous.''16
The foregoing words are those of an interested professor of church
history who talked at length with William in 1841.  Later William specifically
described the reaction of the Smiths when Joseph told them of Moroni's coming:
"[H]e arose and told us how the angel appeared to him, what he
had told him....  He continued talking to us [for] sometime.  The whole family
were melted to tears, and believed all he said.  Knowing that he was very young, that
he had not enjoyed the advantages of a common education; and knowing too, his whole
character and disposition, they were convinced that he was totally incapable of arising
before his aged parents, his brothers and sisters, and so solemnly giving


Page 84
utterance to anything but the truth."17 In this comment William singled out
reasons for the implicit trust of the household in the nearly 18-year-old Joseph: 
his limited education, and "his whole character and disposition."  There
are important historical insights on these points that enable one to see young Joseph
Smith through the eyes of his day-to-day companions.
First of all, it came as a shock that the teenager thought himself
capable of writing a book.  One autobiographical sketch summarizes his total
education in one terse sentence:  "My father was a farmer and taught me the art
of husbandry.''18
 That is to say, muscle and tools were his skills, not study and books.
 Although not illiterate, Joseph at this point of life was relatively unskilled in
reading and writing.  One contemporary at Palmyra pays him the compliment of showing
native intelligence in the "juvenile debating club,''19 but it is a long leap from that to gaining either the
interest or capacity to reproduce scripture.
Joseph himself commented on the demands of life that prevented his
doing much reading.  He mentioned the "indigent circumstances" of the
family, and the necessity "to labor hard" to support the dozen members alive in
1823.  This "required the exertions of all that were able to render any
assistance for the support of the family; therefore, we were deprived of the benefit of an
education.  Suffice it to say, I was merely instructed in reading, writing, and the
ground rules of arithmetic, which constituted my whole literary acquirements."20
William and Lucy Smith concur.  The former pictures his brother
as educated only in a rudimentary way:  "That he was illiterate to some extent
is admitted, but that he was entirely unlettered is a mistake.  In syntax,
orthography, mathematics,


Page 85
grammar, geography, with other studies in the common schools of his
day, he was no novice, and for writing, he wrote a plain, intelligible hand.''21  In other words, Joseph had
taken advantage of limited opportunities for basic education, but (as his mother insists)
he was anything but widely read: at 18 he "had never read the Bible through in his
life.  He seemed much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of
our children, but far more given to meditation and deep study."22  The Smith family measured the
adolescent Joseph and found it unbelievable that he would know history or aspire to
writing it down without the divine direction that he claimed. 
If formal education was subordinate to survival, it was the latter
that fashioned the personalities of the men of the Smith family.  Here Alvin's known
dutifulness reveals the similarly conditioned traits of the older sons--and Alvin's
dutifulness was also a profound influence on Joseph.  The Prophet had loved and
identified with his oldest brother.  Visiting his sister Katherine 20 years after
Alvin's death, he recalled the use of his brother's physical prowess in defending an
underdog: when one Irishman sought to gouge out another's eyes in a fight, "Alvin
took him by his collar and breeches and threw him over the ring, which had been formed to
witness the fight."23
To love Alvin was to love his capacity for obedience:  "I
remember well the pangs of sorrow that swelled my youthful bosom and almost burst my
tender heart when he died.  He was the oldest and the noblest of my father's
family....  In him there was no guile.  He lived without spot from the time he
was a child.  From the time of his birth he never knew mirth.  He was candid and
sober and never would play, and minded his father and mother in toiling all day.24
An untimely death came to Alvin in 1823.  His mother recounts
the deathbed drama, as he exhorted his mature brothers to the responsibility that he had
shouldered all of his life.  He also encouraged his brother Joseph to be obedient to
the revelations of the angel.  It is impressive that such a strong personality as
Alvin believed in Joseph's revelations implicitly.  It is also impressive that he
considered Joseph an obedient person.  Obviously a great measure of Alvin's
seriousness about life was also found in the personality of his prophet-brother. William
writes:  "I was quite wild and inconsiderate, paying no attention to religion of
any kind, for which I received frequent lectures from my mother and my brother
Joseph."25
His mother gives this same picture of Joseph.  Late in life she
summarized her achievement of raising a half-dozen boys and observed, "never was
there a more obedient family."26
 This is known to be true of the cluster of older brothers that surrounded Joseph.
 Alvin, about seven years Joseph's senior, "was a youth of singular goodness of
disposition--kind and amiable."27
 Hyrum, older than Joseph by some six years, was "remarkable for his tenderness
and sympathy" and consistently was "a good, trusty boy."28  Samuel, some two years
younger than Joseph, "always performed his missions faithfully,"29 whether in the Church or in the
Smith household.  These characterizations of her sons by Lucy Mack Smith harmonize
completely with their personalities in later life.30  His mother said that Joseph, a product of the
same environment, was "a remarkably quiet, well-disposed child.''31
The responsibilities that molded these elder Smith brothers were
alluded to by the younger William.


Page 86
He summed up the economic challenge of moving on to forested land
and the result obtained within seven years:  "While there we cleared a large
farm, built a house, planted an orchard, and had commenced living in more comfortable
circumstances."32
 The details are impressive.  "We cleared sixty acres of the heaviest
timber I ever saw,"33
this work "in about five years."34
 "Some of the elms were . . . too large to be cut with a cross-cut saw."35 After cutting, the wood was
gathered for burning: if anyone "had wanted to see Joseph at that time and remained
very long, he would have had to be in the field rolling logs or carrying brush."36  On the place there were
"from twelve to fifteen hundred sugar trees, and to gather the sap and make sugar and
molasses from that number of trees was no lazy job."37  Originally, their land did not even have a
dwelling on it:  "The improvements made on this farm [were] first commenced by
building a log house at no small expense, and at a later date a frame house at a cost of
several hundred dollars,"38
a cash outlay in scarce dollars after the 1820 depression.  A "good fence"
around 60 acres was also built, and "outbuildings, etc."39  In addition to their own
taxing work, the older sons constantly hired out:  "Whenever the neighbors
wanted a good day's work done, they knew where they could get a good hand, and they were
not particular to take any of the other boys before Joseph, either."40  In all the labor described
above, "Joseph did his share of the work with the rest of the boys.''41  Over years of trying
conditions, the Smith family knew Joseph as personally dependable, no small test in a
frontier society.  This is the objective background for William's view that Joseph's
"whole character and disposition" compelled all the family to believe in his
visions.
One episode from the Prophet's youth brings his basic nature into
sharp focus.  This is his painful bone extraction without anesthesia in late
childhood, known ordinarily from Lucy Mack Smith's published account of it, but also
recorded in fair detail in a Nauvoo manuscript note by the Prophet.  Before observing
Joseph's heroism in that ordeal, it is necessary to discuss some background of that event.
 All of the Smith children had been born in Vermont up to and including William,
whose birthdate there is March 13, 1811.  Then Lucy Mack Smith says that the family
moved during 1811 to Lebanon, New Hampshire, where Katherine was born July 8, 1812.42
While at Lebanon Joseph Smith's operation took place.  An
approximate date is possible because this surgery was preceded by an epidemic that
threatened the lives of several of the Smith children.  As Mother Smith says,
"The typhus fever came into Lebanon, and raged tremendously."43  Joseph remembered being cared
for in this period by Dr. Smith, of nearby Hanover.  This dates the epidemic for Dr.
Nathan Smith moved from Dartmouth College to Yale University in the fall of 1813.44  Furthermore, writing his
medical memoirs in 1831, he remembered a typhus epidemic at the time:  "In the
autumn of 1812, Professor Perkins, now of New York, and myself, attended between fifty and
sixty cases of typhus in the vicinity of Dartmouth College...."45  Joseph's leg infection
followed the epidemic, so it is highly probable that his operation took place in the
winter of 1812-1813.  This means that we are studying the reactions of a boy seven
years of age.
The "typhus" of that epidemic; would now be typhoid,
complications after which may affect bone


Page 87
tissue in the manner indicated by Lucy and Joseph Smith.  Both
recount the infectious pain and its intensification in his leg, but Joseph gives the more
objective, summary account:

"And I endured the most acute suffering for a long time, under
  the care of Drs. Smith, Stone, and Perkins, of Hanover.  At one time eleven doctors
  came from Dartmouth Medical College, at Hanover, New Hampshire, for the purpose of
  amputation, but, young as I was, I utterly refused to give my assent to the operation, but
  consented to their trying an experiment by removing a large portion of the bone from my
  left leg, which they did.  And fourteen additional pieces of bone afterwards worked
  out before my leg healed, during which time I was reduced so very low that my mother could
  carry me with ease.  And after I began to get about, I went on crutches till I
  started for the state of New York...."46

After 30 years, Joseph Smith recalled his basic facts correctly.
 Doctors Smith and Perkins did practice jointly in Hanover and were on the Dartmouth
medical faculty.  The "eleven doctors" were undoubtedly medical students--
some 18 graduated in the class of 1813.  Dr. Smith was famed for his skill as a
surgeon in such cases.  In fact, accounts of his operations and the recollections of
Joseph and Lucy Smith precisely agree.  More might be said of all this; the question
at hand, however, concerns the insight that the incident gives into the character of young
Joseph Smith.
The first significant point concerns what Joseph Smith did not
say about himself.  Spare of words and terse on his own suffering, he treats his own
experience without exaggeration.  Such a fact has obvious implications for assessing


Page 88
whether his supernatural experiences might be believed.  His
mother's account moves to the level of personal details of the operation.  Following
known practices, the boy was offered liquor for pain.  At that solemn moment he
avoided what many religious people then branded evil.  Likewise, he opposed orders
that he be bound.  Preserving physical liberty, he insisted that he could best endure
pain in the arms of his trusted father.  Sensitive to his mother's feelings, the boy
requested that she leave the room.  Lucy vividly remembered that moment: 
"Then looking up into my face, his eyes swimming in tears, he continued, 'Now mother,
promise me that you will not stay, will you?  The Lord will help me, and I shall get
through with it."47
 The necessarily brutal incision and forcible bone removal brought screams of pain,
but the first time his mother entered the room, young Joseph recovered enough composure to
direct her to leave:  "I will try to tough it out, if you will go away."48
Courage is first cousin to responsibility and is superbly shown by
Joseph Smith as the child verged upon preadolescent accountability.49  What appears clearly is total
trust in his parents, acute empathy with loved ones, and the power of a personality that
knew how to submit to reality.  In this single pre-vision episode, one can see
qualities that made Joseph's first testimony believable.
In the light of the known character of young Joseph Smith, the
family's complete trust of him is a striking fact.  William Smith repeatedly told of
the angel's coming, with emphasis on the acceptance of that story by his household: 
"[T]here was not a single member of the family of sufficient age to know right from
wrong but what had implicit confidence in the 


Page 89
statements made by my brother Joseph concerning his vision, and the
knowledge he thereby obtained concerning the plates."50
No serious question can be raised concerning the sincerity of the
Smiths, for they sacrificed reputation and safety by upholding Joseph's testimony.
 Consequently, their impressions of young Joseph are a major historical tool.
 They knew the young Prophet intimately; they saw his expressions while relating his
visions, and they judged his sincerity.  They are a critical means of standing close
to Joseph's visions and judging their validity.
It is hard to dismiss the common-sense judgments of the practical
brother of the Prophet:  "All believed it was true: father, mother, brothers,
and sisters.  You can tell what a child is.  Parents know whether their children
are truthful or not.''51
In his last known interview William Smith drove that point home, in
answer to the question of whether the Smiths did not occasionally doubt Joseph's
testimony:

"No.  We all had the most implicit confidence in what he
  said.  He was a truthful boy.  Father and mother believed him.  Why should
  not the children?  I suppose if he had told crooked stories about other things, we
  might have doubted his word about the plates, but Joseph was a truthful boy.  That
  father and mother believed his report and suffered persecution for that belief shows that
  he was truthful.  No sir, we never doubted his word for one minute."52

Top record matches for William Lloyd Smith






Surname meaning for "Smith"
English: occupational name for a worker in metal, from Middle
English smith (Old English smið, probably a
derivative of smitan ‘to strike, hammer’). Metal-working was
one of the earliest occupations for which specialist skills were
required, and its importance ensured that this term and its
equivalents were perhaps the most widespread of all occupational
surnames in Europe. Medieval smiths were important not only in making
horseshoes, plowshares, and other domestic articles, but above all for
their skill in forging swords, other weapons, and armor. This is the
most frequent of all American surnames; it has also absorbed, by
assimilation and translation, cognates and equivalents from many other
languages (for forms, see Hanks and Hodges 1988).
