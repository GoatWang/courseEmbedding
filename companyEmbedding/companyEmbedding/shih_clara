Early life and education[edit]
Shih was born in Hong Kong to a father who was a math professor in Hong Kong and later became an electrical engineer in the United States, and a mother who was an art teacher and a special-education teacher.[4] Shih and her family emigrated to the United States when she was 4, and she grew up in Arlington Heights, Illinois.[1] In elementary school, she was initially placed in special classes for kids with speech impediments because the school did not have a program in English as a second language.[4] In eighth grade, she scored a 1420 on the SAT out of 1600.[5]
She attended Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, where she became captain of the women's varsity tennis team, concert mistress in the orchestra, editor of the student newspaper, captain of the debate team, and a member of the Mu Alpha Theta Mathematics Honor Society.[6] She gave English lessons to immigrants. At 15, she was a computer programmer at Fermilab.[4] Shih was named the Presidential Scholar[3][7] and graduated in 2000.[8]
Shih attended Stanford University, and co-founded the Stanford engineering public service center. She was the president of the campus chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,[6] officer in the Stanford Society of Women Engineers, and was elected to Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society.[3][9][10] In addition to her extracurricular activities, Shih founded Camp Amelia Technology Literacy Group, a nonprofit organization that creates software aimed at improving basic education in underserved communities in the United States and developing countries.[3] She was named a Microsoft Women's Scholar and became an intern at Microsoft, where she developed the RSS news aggregator for Outlook.[4] In her spare time, Shih volunteered in East Palo Alto, California and taught low-income elementary students to become interested in math, science and technology.[4] She was also named a Mayfield Fellow in her senior year, a Merage Foundation for the American Dream Fellow, a Google Anita Borg Scholar, a Microsoft Women's Scholar, and a Society of Women Engineers Scholar.[3] In 2002, Shih did field research for her honors thesis while attending Beijing Foreign Studies University.[3] Shih majored in economics and computer science; she graduated with honors with a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in computer science from Stanford in 2005.[3] She was an intern at Microsoft.[4]
In 2005, Shih was awarded the Marshall Scholarship and attended University of Oxford. She received a master's degree in Internet studies from the University of Oxford Internet Institute.[1]
Career[edit]
After graduating from Oxford, Shih stayed in England and worked in corporate strategy at Google.[4] Shih joined Salesforce.com in 2006 as a founding product marketer on the AppExchange.[8] As a side project, she built a business application on Facebook, known as "Faceforce". The application turned out to be successful, and Shih recruited her old classmate, Steve Garrity, from Microsoft to develop Hearsay Social.[8]
Shih has served as the chief executive officer and co-founder of Hearsay Social since 2009. In December 2011, she was also elected to the Starbucks board of directors, replacing Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.
Shih has received several awards for her achievements, including recognition as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum,[11] the Fortune 40 Under 40 (2012),[12] and the Ad Age 40 Under 40 (2012).[13]
Personal life[edit]
Shih is currently married to health-tech entrepreneur Daniel Chao. They live in San Francisco, California.[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Shih was born in Hong Kong to a father who was a math professor in Hong Kong and later became an electrical engineer in the United States, and a mother who was an art teacher and a special-education teacher.[4] Shih and her family emigrated to the United States when she was 4, and she grew up in Arlington Heights, Illinois.[1] In elementary school, she was initially placed in special classes for kids with speech impediments because the school did not have a program in English as a second language.[4] In eighth grade, she scored a 1420 on the SAT out of 1600.[5]
She attended Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, where she became captain of the women's varsity tennis team, concert mistress in the orchestra, editor of the student newspaper, captain of the debate team, and a member of the Mu Alpha Theta Mathematics Honor Society.[6] She gave English lessons to immigrants. At 15, she was a computer programmer at Fermilab.[4] Shih was named the Presidential Scholar[3][7] and graduated in 2000.[8]
Shih attended Stanford University, and co-founded the Stanford engineering public service center. She was the president of the campus chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,[6] officer in the Stanford Society of Women Engineers, and was elected to Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society.[3][9][10] In addition to her extracurricular activities, Shih founded Camp Amelia Technology Literacy Group, a nonprofit organization that creates software aimed at improving basic education in underserved communities in the United States and developing countries.[3] She was named a Microsoft Women's Scholar and became an intern at Microsoft, where she developed the RSS news aggregator for Outlook.[4] In her spare time, Shih volunteered in East Palo Alto, California and taught low-income elementary students to become interested in math, science and technology.[4] She was also named a Mayfield Fellow in her senior year, a Merage Foundation for the American Dream Fellow, a Google Anita Borg Scholar, a Microsoft Women's Scholar, and a Society of Women Engineers Scholar.[3] In 2002, Shih did field research for her honors thesis while attending Beijing Foreign Studies University.[3] Shih majored in economics and computer science; she graduated with honors with a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in computer science from Stanford in 2005.[3] She was an intern at Microsoft.[4]
In 2005, Shih was awarded the Marshall Scholarship and attended University of Oxford. She received a master's degree in Internet studies from the University of Oxford Internet Institute.[1]
Career[edit]
After graduating from Oxford, Shih stayed in England and worked in corporate strategy at Google.[4] Shih joined Salesforce.com in 2006 as a founding product marketer on the AppExchange.[8] As a side project, she built a business application on Facebook, known as "Faceforce". The application turned out to be successful, and Shih recruited her old classmate, Steve Garrity, from Microsoft to develop Hearsay Social.[8]
Shih has served as the chief executive officer and co-founder of Hearsay Social since 2009. In December 2011, she was also elected to the Starbucks board of directors, replacing Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.
Shih has received several awards for her achievements, including recognition as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum,[11] the Fortune 40 Under 40 (2012),[12] and the Ad Age 40 Under 40 (2012).[13]
Personal life[edit]
Shih is currently married to health-tech entrepreneur Daniel Chao. They live in San Francisco, California.[14]

Why Hearsay Social’s Clara Shih pushes companies to think digitally

Ken Yeung@thekenyeung July 10, 2016 8:02 AM

Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen once opined that “software is eating the world,” referring to the impact companies coming out of the technology industry are having on businesses that have longed dominated the general landscape. As startups either go public or receive extremely high valuations, their services are changing the way work is being conducted, something that has many businesses unnerved.

With Facebook, Twitter, Twilio, Snapchat, Salesforce, Apple, Google, Layer, Uber, and other tech companies rising in popularity and capability, traditional companies (henceforth referred to as “incumbents”) find that their customers are becoming more connected and demanding that they follow suit. But that’s easier said than done — lower-tier managers — such as salespeople and social media managers — may get the picture, but what about those higher up, specifically in the executive suite?
The shift that technology has set in motion isn’t a fad, and incumbents need to take action, but often they don’t know where to begin. Hoping to make those changes as painless as possible, Hearsay Social CEO Clara Shih has a new book, “The Social Business Imperative,” that provides a hand-holding guide for companies looking to become more digitally friendly.
The age of the empowered consumer
Although the term “social business” originated with the onset of social media, it has evolved to be more than just having an organization on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. “Social business is a concept of serving a constantly connected consumer,” Shih explained in an interview with VentureBeat. “Some of the ways you serve [that customer] are on social media, while others aren’t.
“This is about modernization,” said Chris Heuer, a former social business leader at Deloitte and someone who has spent the past two decades helping companies figure out how technology can be used to empower individuals. He described what he calls a  “tectonic shift” in social media connecting the market and “more transparency in society” and concluded that “you can’t have business as usual anymore.”
Social business could be also be defined as digital transformation, something many incumbents realize they’ve been slow to adopt. It’s more than simply building a website so consumers can contact them. It’s about being where the buyers are and relating to their needs. The era of “if you build it, they will come” is over.
“What we’ve typically seen are competitive dynamics that allow a market leader to become complacent, and when they get so big, there’s this ‘too big to fail’ mentality for large organizations. The ultimate time they fail is when no one has to pay them for their goods and services,” Heuer said.

Shih has been a pioneer in this space, especially during her time at Salesforce. It was there that she became one of the first to develop a business application on top of Facebook’s platform. “She saw no limits to the impact that social could have on business relationships,” reflected Charlene Li, the founder and CEO of Altimeter Group. It was during Li’s time as a Forrester analyst that she came across Shih’s work.
The FaceForce app on Facebook and the success Shih generated from her first book, “The Facebook Era,” propelled Shih to launch Hearsay Social. It was conceived as a way to educate incumbents about how to adapt to the digital world. Li cites two ways Shih has so far changed the conversation:
First, she’s created a company and product that enables this [shift]. Hearsay was an early player in the space, enabling widespread social engagement across an organization. Secondly, she’s a thought leader and author, spreading the concept of social business beyond the reaches of her company. The two are inextricably tied together — it’s the concept that social business lives throughout the organization and isn’t limited to a small group of people that has been the core idea of her work.
Shih says we’re living in the “age of the empowered customer,” where today’s buyers “can access information about your company, products, prices, competitors, and more, all on-demand. Never in history have business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business buyers alike had as much power as they do today.”
A guidebook for business executives
“The Social Business Imperative” isn’t aimed at those in the trenches who are constantly exposed to social media and new technologies. Rather it was intended for CEOs, vice presidents, directors, and those in the upper echelon of a more traditional organization.

Shih explained that there are two insights she was particularly interested in sharing: The first is that there’s an increasing divide between what goes on in Silicon Valley and how real companies operate. With that in mind, “Social Business Imperative” helps incumbents navigate the noise and serves as a translation between the two cultures. Secondly, the book was written to encourage management to work together with social media managers and digital marketers to guide their company to success. While some companies are deploying social business tactics, they’re not always seeing desired results. Shih believes that’s because management has to own the strategy, rather than handing it off to the people executing it.
Shih hopes that the book will give you a firm foundation for understanding the social business space. She said that “if you know the lay of the land and the strategic framework, then you can do the research” to formulate how best to implement a digital transformation of your business.” “Social Business Imperative” is meant to “demystify the overwhelming information” that can be found in the thousands of books out there, most of which are filled with marketing jargon.
Although Hearsay Social focuses on financial companies, this 214-page missive is applicable to any business. There are sections detailing strategies for salespeople, for marketing campaigns, customer service, security, mobile and commerce, connected devices, regulatory and legal compliance, information technology, and more. Rather than lecturing, Shih includes case studies and anecdotes from companies like Disney, Lyft, Ameriprise, Warby Parker, Operator, WeChat, Wells Fargo, Intuit, L’Oreal, and Unilever.

Each section not only offers guidance on how businesses should look at the issues but also provides step-by-step ideas for how to follow through on the advice. For example, when detailing how to execute marketing campaigns, Shih cites five key pillars: Have great content; encourage distribution of that content through employees, customers, and influencers; think mobile-first; don’t forget to analyze the data; and abandon campaign silos in favor of integrating other mediums into the mix.
“The reason leadership has a hard time with this is because of a perceived loss of control,” Li explained. “I say ‘perceived’ intentionally because they actually aren’t in control — when social is ‘blocked’ at an organization, employees simply go around the barriers to still connect with each other.” So whether it’s through social networks, our smart devices, or new software and applications designed to make our lives easier, incumbents need to be prepared to adapt and find ways to relate to their customers.
Leading the charge for change
Shih’s efforts, both as an individual and as a representative of Hearsay Social, have won her many fans, including Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. In 2011, Shih was appointed to the board of directors at the beverage company, where she offers guidance on technology and digital strategy. At that time, Schultz described her as “a true technology leader” who “will bring fresh insight to our strong and forward-thinking Board. We could not be more thrilled about the social media expertise and ideas Clara will bring to our business as we continue to amplify the online experience and interactions Starbucks has with our customers, partners, and communities.”
Schultz also wrote the foreword to “Social Business Imperative.”
A graduate of Stanford University and the University of Oxford, Shih spent time working at Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce before teaming up with college friend Steve Garrity to create Hearsay Social more than five years ago. The company is not a consultancy or an agency like Buddy Media or Wildfire Interactive were before both were acquired by Salesforce and Google, respectively. It’s a software company that has an application facilitating engagement between businesses and customers through digital channels.

“Clara’s success going back to her days at Salesforce has always been about translating technical possibilities to business value and conveying that in a very persuasive way,” Heuer said. “Hearsay does solution selling — you’re not just getting the technology implemented, but it’s configured so you can get the best out of it.”
Investor Ben Parr seconded this idea: “Clara cares about getting things done and building products and companies that work. She’s not flashy, and she’s not looking for accolades. She’s looking for customers and new hires and opportunities for her company. She’s the best kind of entrepreneur.”
Bryan Schreier, a venture partner at Sequoia Capital, shared that what drew his firm to continually invest in Hearsay Social was Shih and Garrity. They all first met in 2010, and Shih and Garrity were “prototype entrepreneurs” that Sequoia wanted to partner with. According to Schreier, “they had impeccable resumes, achieved a great deal in their careers, and were working on a company that’s in a space where they’re authentically spending their time and are concerned with.”
He added: “Clara had already written a book about social business and had real domain expertise…She’s a rare example of a leader who’s a thought leader in a space, and at the helm of a company that’s blazing a trail providing incredible value to their customers.”
Shih’s credentials should certainly instill confidence in company executives who are the target audience of “The Social Business Imperative.” Of course, while the book lays out a decent foundation, the digital landscape is quite vast and one book can’t touch on everything. However, it should be able to do what Shih told us she intended — to start moving things forward so companies can transform themselves and adapt to the changing customer landscape.
“The Social Business Imperative” is on sale now.

Early life and education[edit]
Shih was born in Hong Kong to a father who was a math professor in Hong Kong and later became an electrical engineer in the United States, and a mother who was an art teacher and a special-education teacher.[4] Shih and her family emigrated to the United States when she was 4, and she grew up in Arlington Heights, Illinois.[1] In elementary school, she was initially placed in special classes for kids with speech impediments because the school did not have a program in English as a second language.[4] In eighth grade, she scored a 1420 on the SAT out of 1600.[5]
She attended Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, where she became captain of the women's varsity tennis team, concert mistress in the orchestra, editor of the student newspaper, captain of the debate team, and a member of the Mu Alpha Theta Mathematics Honor Society.[6] She gave English lessons to immigrants. At 15, she was a computer programmer at Fermilab.[4] Shih was named the Presidential Scholar[3][7] and graduated in 2000.[8]
Shih attended Stanford University, and co-founded the Stanford engineering public service center. She was the president of the campus chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,[6] officer in the Stanford Society of Women Engineers, and was elected to Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society.[3][9][10] In addition to her extracurricular activities, Shih founded Camp Amelia Technology Literacy Group, a nonprofit organization that creates software aimed at improving basic education in underserved communities in the United States and developing countries.[3] She was named a Microsoft Women's Scholar and became an intern at Microsoft, where she developed the RSS news aggregator for Outlook.[4] In her spare time, Shih volunteered in East Palo Alto, California and taught low-income elementary students to become interested in math, science and technology.[4] She was also named a Mayfield Fellow in her senior year, a Merage Foundation for the American Dream Fellow, a Google Anita Borg Scholar, a Microsoft Women's Scholar, and a Society of Women Engineers Scholar.[3] In 2002, Shih did field research for her honors thesis while attending Beijing Foreign Studies University.[3] Shih majored in economics and computer science; she graduated with honors with a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in computer science from Stanford in 2005.[3] She was an intern at Microsoft.[4]
In 2005, Shih was awarded the Marshall Scholarship and attended University of Oxford. She received a master's degree in Internet studies from the University of Oxford Internet Institute.[1]
Career[edit]
After graduating from Oxford, Shih stayed in England and worked in corporate strategy at Google.[4] Shih joined Salesforce.com in 2006 as a founding product marketer on the AppExchange.[8] As a side project, she built a business application on Facebook, known as "Faceforce". The application turned out to be successful, and Shih recruited her old classmate, Steve Garrity, from Microsoft to develop Hearsay Social.[8]
Shih has served as the chief executive officer and co-founder of Hearsay Social since 2009. In December 2011, she was also elected to the Starbucks board of directors, replacing Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.
Shih has received several awards for her achievements, including recognition as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum,[11] the Fortune 40 Under 40 (2012),[12] and the Ad Age 40 Under 40 (2012).[13]
Personal life[edit]
Shih is currently married to health-tech entrepreneur Daniel Chao. They live in San Francisco, California.[14]

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREThe Facebook Era: Tap Online Social Networks To Build Better Products, Reach More People, And Sell More Stuffby Shih, Clara"People in all demographics and regions of the world are more connected than ever before to the products, issues, places, and individuals in their lives. This book recognizes that we've come to a place where people can represent their real identity--both personal and professional--and use the social filters on the Web to connect with the world around them." --Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook "...A must-read for CEOs and other executives who want to understand Facebook and more importantly take the right actions to stay relevant and stay competitive."  --David Mather, President, Hoovers, Inc. The '90s were about the World Wide Web of information and the power of linking web pages. Today it's about the World Wide Web of people and the power of the social graph. Online social networks are fundamentally changing the way we live, work, and interact. They offer businesses immense opportunities to transform customer relationships for profit: opportunities that touch virtually every business function, from sales and marketing to recruiting, collaboration to executive decision-making, product development to innovation. In The Facebook Era, Clara Shih systematically outlines the business promise of social networking and shows how to transform that promise into reality. Shih is singularly qualified to write this book: One of the world's top business social networking thought leaders and practitioners, she created the first business application on Facebook and leads salesforce.com's partnership with Facebook. Through case studies, examples, and a practical how-to guide, Shih helps individuals, companies, and organizations understand and take advantage of social networks to transform customer relationships for sales and marketing. Shih systematically identifies your best opportunities to use social networks to source new business opportunities, target marketing messages, find the best employees, and engage customers as true partners throughout the innovation cycle. Finally, she presents a detailed action plan for positioning your company to win in today's radically new era: The Facebook Era. Join the conversation--... Fan the book--... Right this minute, more than 1.5 million people are on Facebook. They're interacting with friends--and talking about your brands. They're learning about your business--and providing valuable information you can use to market and sell. In the Facebook Era, you're closer to your customers than ever before. Read this book, and then go get them! Clara Shih offers best practices for overcoming obstacles to success, ranging from privacy and security issues to brand misrepresentation, and previews social networking trends that are just beginning to emerge--helping you get ahead of the curve and ahead of the competition, too.  * Includes a practical 60-day action plan for positioning your company to win in the Facebook Era* For companies of all sizes, in all industries--and business functions ranging from marketing to operations* By Clara Shih, creator of Faceconnector, the first business application on Facebook Learn how to! * Understand how social networking transforms our personal and professional relationships Why social networking will have business impact comparable to the Internet* Use online social networks to hypertarget your customers Hone in on precise audience segments and then tailor custom campaigns with powerful personal and social relevance* Define and implement your optimal social networking brand strategy Ask the right questions, set the right goals and priorities, and execute on it* Implement effective governance and compliance Understand and mitigate the risks of social networking/Web 2.0 initiativesInternet MarketingCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

The Social Business Imperative: Adapting Your Business Model to the Always-Connected Customer 







The Facebook Era

















The Social Selling Revolution: How LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter are Transforming How Agents Sell: Every day, a billion people share the most important moments of their lives on social media, from new jobs to newborns -- and everything in between. Your own social networks are full of these “social signals” and your competitors are acting on this information in real time. The days of cold outreach are over-- today's savvy agents leverage these real-time insights to get smart about whom to reach out to, when to reach out, and what to say as well as to build deep lasting relationships that result in renewal, upsell, and referrals. Bestselling author, social media expert and Silicon Valley tech CEO Clara Shih will walk through how to succeed in today's radically different selling environment.
Comprehensive Facebook Marketing Play Book: Thanks to Facebook, people are sharing more about themselves online than ever before. Not only is this affecting personal relationships, marketers too can use this information to better target their messages. The ultimate holy grail for marketers is a 100% response rate for their campaigns. The data shows unequivocally: response rates go up dramatically when the communication feels personalized or is endorsed by a friend. With hypertargeting, news feeds, and retweets, Facebook and Twitter give us the opportunity do both. Marketers need to be where their customers are and communicate via the channels preferred by their audiences. Increasingly, this is on Facebook. To be successful in the Facebook Era, marketers need to master the new skillset and consumer psychology of the social web.
Lean Startup Principles for Sales: Startup Lessons Learned explores what it takes to succeed in building a lean startup. The goal is to give practitioners and students of the lean startup methodology the opportunity to hear insights from leaders in embracing and deploying the core principles of the lean startup methodology. The day-long event will feature a mix of panels and talks focused on the key challenges and issues that technical and market-facing people at startups need to understand in order to succeed in building successful lean startups.
7 Habits of Successful Facebook Marketers: Every marketer knows that social media is “important”. The question is how to actually put the channel to work in a revenue-generation program. Now, DMCNY gives you an opportunity to explore possible answers with nationally-known social media strategist and author Clara Shih. How B2C and B2B marketers engage audiences with timely content and memorable campaigns Using compelling case studies from successful brands, Ms. Shih will take us through the process of going where your customers are, grabbing their attention and delivering results to the bottom line.
The Future of Distribution and Marketing: Staying Relevant in the Digital Era: "All aspects of human life are being digitized," said Geoffrey Moore. Financial services firms have three choices: ignore, innovate, or die. Continue Reading »
