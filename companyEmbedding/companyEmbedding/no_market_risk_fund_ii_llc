What is 'Market Risk'
Market risk is the possibility for an investor to experience losses due to factors that affect the overall performance of the financial markets in which he is involved. Market risk, also called "systematic risk," cannot be eliminated through diversification, though it can be hedged against. Sources of market risk include recessions, political turmoil, changes in interest rates, natural disasters and terrorist attacks.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Market Risk'
      Companies in the United States are required by the SEC to detail how their productivity and results may be linked to the performance of the financial markets. This is meant to provide a reflection of how a company is exposed to financial risk. For example, a company providing derivative investments or foreign exchange futures may be more exposed to financial risk than companies who do not provide these types of investments. This information helps investors and traders make decisions based on their own risk management rules.The two major categories of investment risk are market risk and specific risk. Specific risk, also called "unsystematic risk," is tied directly to the performance of a particular security and can be protected against through investment diversification. One example of unsystematic risk is a company declaring bankruptcy, making its stock worthless to investors.Under these categories are different classifications that involve unique aspects of financial markets. The most common types of market risks include interest rate risk, equity risk, currency risk and commodity risk.Interest rate risk covers the volatility that happens with changing interest rates due to fundamental factors, such as Libor and other central bank announcements related to changes in monetary policies. Equity risk is the risk involved in the changing stock prices. An investor is exposed to currency risk if he is holding particular currencies facing volatile movements, because of fundamental factors such as interest rate changes or unemployment claims. Commodity risk covers the changing prices of commodities such as crude oil and corn.Market Risk Due to VolatilityMarket risk exists because of price changes. The standard deviation of changes in prices of stocks, currencies or commodities is referred to as price volatility. Volatility is rated in annualized terms. It may be expressed as an absolute number, such as $10, or a percentage of the initial value, such as 10%.Value at RiskTo measure market risk, investors and analysts use the value at risk method. The value at risk method is a well known and established risk management method, but it comes with some assumptions that limit its correctness. For example, it assumes that the makeup and content of the portfolio being measured is unchanged over a provided period. Though this may be acceptable for short-term horizons, it may provide less accurate measurements for long-term horizons of investments, because it is more exposed to changes in interest rates and monetary policies.

Why are mutual funds subject to market risk?


    By Claire Boyte-White | October 13, 2015 — 12:16 PM EDT    






Share









































A:
Like all securities, mutual funds are subject to market, or systematic, risk. This is because there is no way to predict what will happen in the future or whether a given asset will increase or decrease in value. Because the market cannot be accurately predicted or completely controlled, no investment is risk-free.
What Is Market Risk?
Market risk is the risk inherent in all types of investments that results from the fickle nature of the market and of the global economy in general. Market risk is simply the possibility the market or economy will decline, causing individual investments to lose value regardless of the performance or profitability of the issuing entity. For example, in the stock market crash of 2008, nearly every stock lost value despite the fact that most companies had not done anything wrong or altered their operations in any way. The result could not have been predicted or prevented by any one company, except for a few in the banking sector of course.
Types of Market Risk
There are many components of market risk that apply to different types of investments. The common types of market risk are equity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, inflation risk, sociopolitical risk and country risk. Some types of investments are susceptible to multiple types of market risk. The type of market risk that applies to mutual funds depends on the assets held in its portfolio.
Equity risk applies to investments in the stock market and refers to the risk that changing prices in the stock market may render an individual investment less valuable when the owner wants to sell. This type of risk applies doubly to stock funds. First, the value of mutual funds can fluctuate, causing shareholder investment to lose value. In addition, the value of stock funds is dependent entirely on the market value of portfolios comprised solely of stocks, which in turn are also subject to equity risk. Equity risk also applies to balanced funds that include stock investments.
Interest rate risk applies to investments in debt securities, such as government and corporate bonds. This type of risk relates to the possibility that rising interest rates, as dictated by the Federal Reserve, will render current bonds less valuable. This type of risk impacts bond funds, money market funds and balanced funds. Credit risk, or the risk a bond issue will default, also applies to bond funds.
Inflation risk, as the name implies, is the risk that gradual inflation will erode the value of the dollar and reduce the value of long-term investments. Inflation risk is primarily an issue for money market funds because their returns are so low they could easily be outstripped by inflation over time.
Sociopolitical risk refers to the possibility that events such as war, acts of terror or political elections may have negative impacts on the market in general. Similarly, country risk refers to the same phenomena but only when applied to events that impact investments in foreign countries. Depending on the specific product, these types of market risk can apply to any mutual fund because they impact the U.S. or foreign markets in general, which in turn affect the equity and debt assets within a fund's portfolio.
