The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Netflix ISP Speed Index for December 2016
Written By
													Marlee Tart
							
											

Here are some highlights from the December data for the Netflix ISP Speed Index, our monthly update on which Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provide the best prime-time Netflix streaming experience.
In the U.S., Comcast achieved the No. 1 spot for the first time, increasing its average monthly speed in December to 3.84 Megabits per second (Mbps), up from 3.67 Mbps in November. CenturyLink also had a significant increase in speed, climbing to 2.79 Mbps from 2.55 Mbps in November.
In Canada, Telus - Fiber Optic moved up four spots to No. 5, delivering an average monthly speed of 3.46 Mbps, up from 3.13 Mbps in November. Telus - DSL moved up two spots to ninth place, increasing its speed to 3.28 Mbps in December from 3.05 Mbps in November. These speed increases helped Canada rise spots to 20th place in our country rankings.
Taiwan’s So-net moved into first place, increasing its average monthly speed to 3.40 Mbps in December from 2.83 Mbps the month prior. TFN rose two spots to 3rd place, with an average monthly speed of 2.98 Mbps, up from 2.81 Mbps in November. Hoshin Multimedia dropped three spots to fifth place in December, with speeds slowing to 2.71 Mbps from 2.95 Mbps in November.
In the Philippines, SKYCable moved up to No. 3, delivering an average monthly speed of 2.23 Mbps in December, compared with 1.85 Mbps in November.
Jamaica’s Digicel Play maintained first place and had a significant increase in average monthly speed to 3.42 Mbps in December, up from 3.00 Mbps in November.
Paraguay’s Tigo Star remained No. 1, but posted a significant gain in speed of 0.52 Mbps, increasing to 2.70 Mbps in December and bumping Paraguay up three spots in the overall country ranking to 41st place.
The Netflix ISP Speed Index is a measure of prime time Netflix performance on a particular ISP and not a measure of overall performance for other services/data that may travel across the specific ISP network. Faster Netflix performance generally means better picture quality, quicker start times and fewer interruptions.
