                MacroTower gets you more for your marketing dollars.
              





"Are we spending money on the right things?"
Stop wondering what kind of ROI your campaigns are providing. MacroTower links every dollar you spent to the revenue it created. Everything from salary to AdWords spend, it’s all accounted for.







Eliminate marketing waste

                The average company wastes 65% of their marketing spend, largely due to a lack of measurement. MacroTower helps identify and eliminate this waste, so you can put that found money towards a proven winner.
              







Experiment with confidence

                Nothing kills growth like complacency. As soon as you find new ways to generate revenue, it’s a matter of time before the herd follows. MacroTower lets you test new campaign ideas with real-time feedback — so your business keeps a step ahead.
              







The data you need, in one place.

                We keep you out of Excel. Gone are the days spent cleaning and compiling data from different systems, or wondering if finance has a more accurate view than you. With MacroTower, it's all there in front of you.
              























                MacroTower takes gut-feel out of customer acquisition.
              











Goal setting
Confidently commit to lead or pipeline goals. Reports show the difference between goals which are achievable and unrealistic.











Budgeting
Knowing what to expect from your marketing investments takes the stress out of budgeting. We keep the CEO, Finance, and Marketing working from the same page.











Execution
The facts on the ground are always changing. MacroTower is your early-warning system that alerts you when to double-down on a winning campaign, or to cut an underperformer.













Reporting
Always up-to-date reports that are shareable, exportable, and crisp. Popups allow you to check our work. Check source data with a single click.











Optimization
When your latest round of campaigns finish, what could have gone better? MacroTower identifies wasteful spending, allowing you to re-allocate funds towards campaigns with higher ROI.











Data Cleanliness
What good are reports if the data they use is a mess? MacroTower learns where your data-keeping needs improvement and gives instantly actionable recommendations on how to clean it up.

Customizations you *should* make with Record Types

As we covered previously, Salesforce Record Types aren't always the right solution. What's important is knowing what type of type you're trying to capture in Salesforce. All cautions aside, we left one thing out:
So what type of types are Salesforce Record Types and when should you use them?

How To Clean Up Lead Source, One Bite At A Time

  


                                            Kyle Paice    
                                        

                                            April 20, 2017    
                                        













Lead Source is the single most important piece of information a marketing team tracks in their CRM. If it's inaccurate or incomplete, they'll be flying blind when it's time to decide where to spend their budget. You'll lose leads, opportunities, and customers as a result.Most companies don't have clean attribution data, and yet totally understand why it's so important. Then why do they wait so long? Because cleaning attribution data can be a big undertaking, so they put it off until they have the time to tackle it. Whenever I hear this rationale, I think of the same saying:"How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time."Don't focus on the massive undertaking overall, just focus on the next action you need to take to move things forward. Here are the bites you should take, in order, to clean up your Lead Source and attribution data once and for all.

Counting Down the Top 5 Sales Ops Mistakes

  


                                            Richard Acton-Maher    
                                        

                                            April 18, 2017    
                                        













Sales Ops, or any function that supports revenue-generating teams, is becoming increasingly more difficult and complex. The good news is, those teams are spending far less time typing, tracking, reporting, and transcribing and far more doing exactly what they were hired to do: generate more revenue.
But with every new tool or feature, the underlying systems they use become exponentially more complex. Which means when things go wrong, it's harder to figure out why. With that in mind, we've compiled the top 5 mistakes Sales Ops professionals should avoid to keep these systems (and their users) running smoothly.
 
5. Don't wait too long to stop the bleeding.

If you just started using CRM and/or marketing automation software, congrats! You're on the right track. Unfortunately, I suspect many people reading this already have a jungle of systems that's become overgrown and increasingly harder to keep track of due to months or years of neglect. Bad historical data, broken API integrations, old forms that don't use the right fields, inexplicabe errors; they're usually all par for the course.

The Revenue Ops Hierarchy of Needs

  


                                            Kyle Paice    
                                        

                                            April 17, 2017    
                                        













I'm not a fan of "Sales Ops" as a term. Today, every department has the sales rep's equivalent of Salesforce -- a system that they live in for the majority of their day (e.g., CSMs have Gainsight, marketers have HubSpot, etc.). Since all of these systems are interconnected and rely on each other for key pieces of information, "Revenue Ops" is probably a more accurate term for the person on your team that's responsible for making them all play nice.
The hardest part of onboarding a Revenue Ops Manager? So many projects, so little time. Everyone on your exec team probably has a pet rock or two that they can't wait to get done. Since all of these projects have executive sponsors and seem super valuable, the natural reaction is to dive in and just start "fixing stuff." Believe it or not, this can lead to disaster.
The good news? There's a smart way to prioritize your Revenue Ops backlog. Based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, I present to you the MacroTower Hierarchy of Revenue Ops. The idea is that you begin with a solid foundation, and then build your way upward. If there is some incredibly pressing business issue, you can work on two adjacent levels in concert. But I don't recommend skipping a level. In my experience, it's a recipe for disaster.

Why Google Analytics isn't great for SaaS

  


                                            Kyle Paice

On the surface, Google Analytics is a great product. It's free, powerful, and scales really well. You can get its reports to tell you almost anything about which pages people view and how they're interacting with them.
What Google Analytics can't do, however, is track who these people are and how they progress through the funnel over the course of a full sales cycle.If you're a SaaS company, and your sales model isn't self-serve, you're gonna have a bad time running meaningful reports with Google Analytics.

Don't play hide-and-seek with your costs

As we've discussed before, CAC is an incredibly important and powerful metric. There is arguably no better way to reach profitable growth than by tracking CAC closely and putting your money where it will have the highest ROI. But too often it seems like tracking it is a momumental feat. Somehow, in all the hustle, exactly how much was spent on what, and what spending pertained to what campaign, and what this random check was for from three months ago-- gets lost.

Without this data, your CAC stats are useless.

Unless you're tracking CAC at the campaign level, it'll be tough to make the right decisions around where you'll spend your marketing dollars.
As we discussed yesterday, the math behind CAC at the campaign level is simple...in theory. For Campaign A:
CAC(A) = Total Spend(A) / Customers Acquired(A)
But there's a danger in this simplicity. The above formula can lead you to believe that only expenses that are exclusive to Campaign A should be included in the equation. You might think that CAC(A) doesn't have to take salaries and other high-level marketing expenses into account. That isn't true.

Tracking CAC By Campaign Is A Really Big Deal

Yesterday, we had a brief "explain like I’m five" on Customer Acquisition Cost. Today, we'll run through why CAC is so important and why you need to track it separately for all your different campaigns.In case you missed it, CAC stands for Customer Acquisition Cost. It measures how much money a company has to spend in order to convince a customer to buy their product.If a company is able to figure out which channels allow them to acquire customers cheapest, then they can grow their business a lot faster. Why? Because they avoid wasting time and money on inefficient channels. Plus, lowering CAC means a company has the option to either pocket the increase in profit on each unit they sell or to charge less for their product without sacrificing existing profit.The easiest way to think about why lower CAC is awesome? You're spending less money to make money. Pretty great, right?

When the funnel is humming and you’re on pace to hit your goals for the quarter, it’s a common reaction to focus 100% of your time, money, and attention on the campaigns that are already working.This is a mistake.

Note: CAC is Sometimes known as COCA (Cost of Customer Acquisition)Customer Acquisition Cost measures how much money, on average, you have to spend in order to close a new customer.Imagine you’re standing in front of three vending machines: A, B, and C. All three of them serve Coke, but there’s no prices on any of them. Just a place to feed your dollar, and a red button to push. You’re a little unsure for a moment, and there are three people behind you in line, so you decide to see what they do.
