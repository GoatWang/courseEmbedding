History[edit]
Origins[edit]
In the 1930s, after saving up $300, Joseph Howard Hinshaw,[6] a World War I veteran and legendary trial lawyer, decided to establish his own law firm. In 1934, Hinshaw and James G. Culbertson, a renowned banking and corporate transactional lawyer who was referred by Clarence Darrow, began a law firm partnership on LaSalle Street in Chicago called "Hinshaw & Culbertson." The unique coupling of Hinshaw's trial expertise and Culbertson's "flair for the numbers" was a potent force.
Early Expansion[edit]
In 1963, the firm opened its second office in Wheaton, Illinois (now the Lisle, Illinois office).[7] The firm continued to open offices throughout Illinois and the surrounding states of Missouri and Wisconsin.[8]
Hinshaw, Culbertson, Moelmann, Hoban & Fuller[edit]
By the mid-1980s, the firm established groups specializing in appeals, corporate law, health care law, insurance coverage, labor and employment law, legal malpractice, medical malpractice, products liability and real estate. During this time, the firm began its expansion beyond the midwest, opening an office in Miami, Florida.
That period of expansion, and the formative years that preceded it, saw several new faces join the firm. The firm's name expanded in kind. From 1980 to 1993, the firm had five name partners and was known as "Hinshaw, Culbertson, Moelmann, Hoban & Fuller."
One of those additional name partners, John M. Moelmann,[9] was one of the leading litigators in Illinois, specializing in the area of medical malpractice.
George S. Hoban,[10] the fourth name partner of the firm, followed in the steps of Culbertson as the firm's most prominent corporate attorney. He first began his practice with Hinshaw in 1938 and eventually became a managing partner of the firm. In that role, he shepherded much of Hinshaw's early growth until he retired in 1979.
The fifth name partner, Perry Fuller,[11] was a protégé of Hinshaw. Fuller became a highly successful litigator who argued cases before the Illinois and United States Supreme Courts, among many other trial and appellate courts. Following in the steps of his mentor, Fuller imparted his own knowledge to countless lawyers in the firm for more than 40 years.
Hoban's efforts toward growing the firm were continued and expanded upon by Dennis M. Horan,[12] who was responsible for opening the Springfield and Miami offices. Horan died in 1988. He was followed as Chairman of the firm by Donald L. Mrozek.[13] Under Mrozek's stewardship, the firm greatly expanded its practice areas, and began representing a higher caliber of clients. Likewise, Mrozek oversaw the firm's expansion from a handful of states, to 12 states, from New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island to California and Oregon.[14]
Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP[edit]
In 2004, the firm established itself as a limited liability partnership and the firm's name was reverted to "Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP."
In time, the firm gained stature as one of the largest in the United States (NLJ 250),[15] ranking in the top 200 list of profitable firms (the AmLaw 200),[16] in the country. The firm began providing regular counsel to Fortune 500 companies and advising state and local governments. It provided representation in several important and high-profile cases; in doing so, the firm played a critical role in forming the law in several areas.[17]
In January 2014, the attorneys comprising the Portland, Oregon office of Hinshaw left to join the international firm Holland & Knight, establishing that firm's first professional ethics practice group.[18]
In October, 2014, Hinshaw announced a merger with Barger & Wolen LLP, a prominent, California-based insurance and regulatory firm.[19] The merger brought Hinshaw's lawyer count to 500, and lifted its insurance, reinsurance, and government regulatory practices to among the country's most profitable.[20] The merger also represented the firm's entry into international law practice, adding an office in London. The combined firms retained the name Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP. Building on its insurance and reinsurance services practice group, the firm added an additional team of coverage litigators from Meckler Bulger Tilson following the merger of MBT and Cozen O'Connor in April 2015.[21]
On June 1, 2015, Donald L. Mrozek stepped down as Chairman of Hinshaw. He is succeeded by Kevin Joseph Burke, litigation partner and former Vice Chairman of the firm. The move marked the first change to Hinshaw's leadership in nearly three decades.[22] The change in Hinshaw's top post was accompanied by a unilateral shake-up of the nationwide management committee and practice groups leadership, a strategy rarely seen absent a partnership vote in similarly sized law firms.[23]
Nearly one year into his role as Chairman of Hinshaw, Burke appointed a new managing partner (Robert T. Shannon), four new management committee members (Richard G. De La Mora, Michael M. Marick, Maura K. McKelvey and Schuyler B. Kraus), five new practice group leaders (Sergio E. Acosta, Ronald L. Kammer, Scott M. Seaman, Ellen B. Silverman and J. Richard Supple Jr.), and seven new partners-in-charge (Lora L. Zimmer in Appleton, Wisconsin; Diane E. Webster in Chicago; Spencer Y. Kook in Los Angeles; Karen A. Brimmer and Ronald L. Kammer in Miami; Noah D. Fiedler in Milwaukee; and Matthew M. Hevrin in Rockford, Illinois) in March 2016.[3]
The firm has stated its intentions of expanding further internationally, with an emphasis on growth in South America and Asia.[24]
Rankings & Recognition[edit]
Hinshaw ranks #82 on the list of the 400 largest law firms in the United States.[4]
Many of Hinshaw's practices areas and its attorneys are frequent recipients of high ratings from services such as Chambers & Partners,[25] U.S. News & World Report,[26] and Martindale-Hubbell.[27] In particular, Hinshaw's appellate practice is regularly ranked as among the nation's elite.[26]
The firm has been named the #1 U.S. firm for the defense of law firms and legal professionals.[28]
The firm also has been recognized as having one of the "mightiest" insurance litigation, transactional and regulatory practices.[29]
The firm is ranked #56 on the list of the top 100 U.S law firms for minority attorneys.[30]
In October 2015, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker appointed Justice Rebecca Bradley to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Bradley began her legal career as a litigator at Hinshaw.[31]
In December 2015, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel named Hinshaw Partner Sergio Acosta to the city's Task Force on Police Accountability, created out of response to the shooting of Ronald Johnson by a Chicago police officer.[32]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
In the 1930s, after saving up $300, Joseph Howard Hinshaw,[6] a World War I veteran and legendary trial lawyer, decided to establish his own law firm. In 1934, Hinshaw and James G. Culbertson, a renowned banking and corporate transactional lawyer who was referred by Clarence Darrow, began a law firm partnership on LaSalle Street in Chicago called "Hinshaw & Culbertson." The unique coupling of Hinshaw's trial expertise and Culbertson's "flair for the numbers" was a potent force.
Early Expansion[edit]
In 1963, the firm opened its second office in Wheaton, Illinois (now the Lisle, Illinois office).[7] The firm continued to open offices throughout Illinois and the surrounding states of Missouri and Wisconsin.[8]
Hinshaw, Culbertson, Moelmann, Hoban & Fuller[edit]
By the mid-1980s, the firm established groups specializing in appeals, corporate law, health care law, insurance coverage, labor and employment law, legal malpractice, medical malpractice, products liability and real estate. During this time, the firm began its expansion beyond the midwest, opening an office in Miami, Florida.
That period of expansion, and the formative years that preceded it, saw several new faces join the firm. The firm's name expanded in kind. From 1980 to 1993, the firm had five name partners and was known as "Hinshaw, Culbertson, Moelmann, Hoban & Fuller."
One of those additional name partners, John M. Moelmann,[9] was one of the leading litigators in Illinois, specializing in the area of medical malpractice.
George S. Hoban,[10] the fourth name partner of the firm, followed in the steps of Culbertson as the firm's most prominent corporate attorney. He first began his practice with Hinshaw in 1938 and eventually became a managing partner of the firm. In that role, he shepherded much of Hinshaw's early growth until he retired in 1979.
The fifth name partner, Perry Fuller,[11] was a protégé of Hinshaw. Fuller became a highly successful litigator who argued cases before the Illinois and United States Supreme Courts, among many other trial and appellate courts. Following in the steps of his mentor, Fuller imparted his own knowledge to countless lawyers in the firm for more than 40 years.
Hoban's efforts toward growing the firm were continued and expanded upon by Dennis M. Horan,[12] who was responsible for opening the Springfield and Miami offices. Horan died in 1988. He was followed as Chairman of the firm by Donald L. Mrozek.[13] Under Mrozek's stewardship, the firm greatly expanded its practice areas, and began representing a higher caliber of clients. Likewise, Mrozek oversaw the firm's expansion from a handful of states, to 12 states, from New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island to California and Oregon.[14]
Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP[edit]
In 2004, the firm established itself as a limited liability partnership and the firm's name was reverted to "Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP."
In time, the firm gained stature as one of the largest in the United States (NLJ 250),[15] ranking in the top 200 list of profitable firms (the AmLaw 200),[16] in the country. The firm began providing regular counsel to Fortune 500 companies and advising state and local governments. It provided representation in several important and high-profile cases; in doing so, the firm played a critical role in forming the law in several areas.[17]
In January 2014, the attorneys comprising the Portland, Oregon office of Hinshaw left to join the international firm Holland & Knight, establishing that firm's first professional ethics practice group.[18]
In October, 2014, Hinshaw announced a merger with Barger & Wolen LLP, a prominent, California-based insurance and regulatory firm.[19] The merger brought Hinshaw's lawyer count to 500, and lifted its insurance, reinsurance, and government regulatory practices to among the country's most profitable.[20] The merger also represented the firm's entry into international law practice, adding an office in London. The combined firms retained the name Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP. Building on its insurance and reinsurance services practice group, the firm added an additional team of coverage litigators from Meckler Bulger Tilson following the merger of MBT and Cozen O'Connor in April 2015.[21]
On June 1, 2015, Donald L. Mrozek stepped down as Chairman of Hinshaw. He is succeeded by Kevin Joseph Burke, litigation partner and former Vice Chairman of the firm. The move marked the first change to Hinshaw's leadership in nearly three decades.[22] The change in Hinshaw's top post was accompanied by a unilateral shake-up of the nationwide management committee and practice groups leadership, a strategy rarely seen absent a partnership vote in similarly sized law firms.[23]
Nearly one year into his role as Chairman of Hinshaw, Burke appointed a new managing partner (Robert T. Shannon), four new management committee members (Richard G. De La Mora, Michael M. Marick, Maura K. McKelvey and Schuyler B. Kraus), five new practice group leaders (Sergio E. Acosta, Ronald L. Kammer, Scott M. Seaman, Ellen B. Silverman and J. Richard Supple Jr.), and seven new partners-in-charge (Lora L. Zimmer in Appleton, Wisconsin; Diane E. Webster in Chicago; Spencer Y. Kook in Los Angeles; Karen A. Brimmer and Ronald L. Kammer in Miami; Noah D. Fiedler in Milwaukee; and Matthew M. Hevrin in Rockford, Illinois) in March 2016.[3]
The firm has stated its intentions of expanding further internationally, with an emphasis on growth in South America and Asia.[24]
Rankings & Recognition[edit]
Hinshaw ranks #82 on the list of the 400 largest law firms in the United States.[4]
Many of Hinshaw's practices areas and its attorneys are frequent recipients of high ratings from services such as Chambers & Partners,[25] U.S. News & World Report,[26] and Martindale-Hubbell.[27] In particular, Hinshaw's appellate practice is regularly ranked as among the nation's elite.[26]
The firm has been named the #1 U.S. firm for the defense of law firms and legal professionals.[28]
The firm also has been recognized as having one of the "mightiest" insurance litigation, transactional and regulatory practices.[29]
The firm is ranked #56 on the list of the top 100 U.S law firms for minority attorneys.[30]
In October 2015, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker appointed Justice Rebecca Bradley to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Bradley began her legal career as a litigator at Hinshaw.[31]
In December 2015, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel named Hinshaw Partner Sergio Acosta to the city's Task Force on Police Accountability, created out of response to the shooting of Ronald Johnson by a Chicago police officer.[32]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
In the 1930s, after saving up $300, Joseph Howard Hinshaw,[6] a World War I veteran and legendary trial lawyer, decided to establish his own law firm. In 1934, Hinshaw and James G. Culbertson, a renowned banking and corporate transactional lawyer who was referred by Clarence Darrow, began a law firm partnership on LaSalle Street in Chicago called "Hinshaw & Culbertson." The unique coupling of Hinshaw's trial expertise and Culbertson's "flair for the numbers" was a potent force.
Early Expansion[edit]
In 1963, the firm opened its second office in Wheaton, Illinois (now the Lisle, Illinois office).[7] The firm continued to open offices throughout Illinois and the surrounding states of Missouri and Wisconsin.[8]
Hinshaw, Culbertson, Moelmann, Hoban & Fuller[edit]
By the mid-1980s, the firm established groups specializing in appeals, corporate law, health care law, insurance coverage, labor and employment law, legal malpractice, medical malpractice, products liability and real estate. During this time, the firm began its expansion beyond the midwest, opening an office in Miami, Florida.
That period of expansion, and the formative years that preceded it, saw several new faces join the firm. The firm's name expanded in kind. From 1980 to 1993, the firm had five name partners and was known as "Hinshaw, Culbertson, Moelmann, Hoban & Fuller."
One of those additional name partners, John M. Moelmann,[9] was one of the leading litigators in Illinois, specializing in the area of medical malpractice.
George S. Hoban,[10] the fourth name partner of the firm, followed in the steps of Culbertson as the firm's most prominent corporate attorney. He first began his practice with Hinshaw in 1938 and eventually became a managing partner of the firm. In that role, he shepherded much of Hinshaw's early growth until he retired in 1979.
The fifth name partner, Perry Fuller,[11] was a protégé of Hinshaw. Fuller became a highly successful litigator who argued cases before the Illinois and United States Supreme Courts, among many other trial and appellate courts. Following in the steps of his mentor, Fuller imparted his own knowledge to countless lawyers in the firm for more than 40 years.
Hoban's efforts toward growing the firm were continued and expanded upon by Dennis M. Horan,[12] who was responsible for opening the Springfield and Miami offices. Horan died in 1988. He was followed as Chairman of the firm by Donald L. Mrozek.[13] Under Mrozek's stewardship, the firm greatly expanded its practice areas, and began representing a higher caliber of clients. Likewise, Mrozek oversaw the firm's expansion from a handful of states, to 12 states, from New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island to California and Oregon.[14]
Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP[edit]
In 2004, the firm established itself as a limited liability partnership and the firm's name was reverted to "Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP."
In time, the firm gained stature as one of the largest in the United States (NLJ 250),[15] ranking in the top 200 list of profitable firms (the AmLaw 200),[16] in the country. The firm began providing regular counsel to Fortune 500 companies and advising state and local governments. It provided representation in several important and high-profile cases; in doing so, the firm played a critical role in forming the law in several areas.[17]
In January 2014, the attorneys comprising the Portland, Oregon office of Hinshaw left to join the international firm Holland & Knight, establishing that firm's first professional ethics practice group.[18]
In October, 2014, Hinshaw announced a merger with Barger & Wolen LLP, a prominent, California-based insurance and regulatory firm.[19] The merger brought Hinshaw's lawyer count to 500, and lifted its insurance, reinsurance, and government regulatory practices to among the country's most profitable.[20] The merger also represented the firm's entry into international law practice, adding an office in London. The combined firms retained the name Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP. Building on its insurance and reinsurance services practice group, the firm added an additional team of coverage litigators from Meckler Bulger Tilson following the merger of MBT and Cozen O'Connor in April 2015.[21]
On June 1, 2015, Donald L. Mrozek stepped down as Chairman of Hinshaw. He is succeeded by Kevin Joseph Burke, litigation partner and former Vice Chairman of the firm. The move marked the first change to Hinshaw's leadership in nearly three decades.[22] The change in Hinshaw's top post was accompanied by a unilateral shake-up of the nationwide management committee and practice groups leadership, a strategy rarely seen absent a partnership vote in similarly sized law firms.[23]
Nearly one year into his role as Chairman of Hinshaw, Burke appointed a new managing partner (Robert T. Shannon), four new management committee members (Richard G. De La Mora, Michael M. Marick, Maura K. McKelvey and Schuyler B. Kraus), five new practice group leaders (Sergio E. Acosta, Ronald L. Kammer, Scott M. Seaman, Ellen B. Silverman and J. Richard Supple Jr.), and seven new partners-in-charge (Lora L. Zimmer in Appleton, Wisconsin; Diane E. Webster in Chicago; Spencer Y. Kook in Los Angeles; Karen A. Brimmer and Ronald L. Kammer in Miami; Noah D. Fiedler in Milwaukee; and Matthew M. Hevrin in Rockford, Illinois) in March 2016.[3]
The firm has stated its intentions of expanding further internationally, with an emphasis on growth in South America and Asia.[24]
Rankings & Recognition[edit]
Hinshaw ranks #82 on the list of the 400 largest law firms in the United States.[4]
Many of Hinshaw's practices areas and its attorneys are frequent recipients of high ratings from services such as Chambers & Partners,[25] U.S. News & World Report,[26] and Martindale-Hubbell.[27] In particular, Hinshaw's appellate practice is regularly ranked as among the nation's elite.[26]
The firm has been named the #1 U.S. firm for the defense of law firms and legal professionals.[28]
The firm also has been recognized as having one of the "mightiest" insurance litigation, transactional and regulatory practices.[29]
The firm is ranked #56 on the list of the top 100 U.S law firms for minority attorneys.[30]
In October 2015, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker appointed Justice Rebecca Bradley to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Bradley began her legal career as a litigator at Hinshaw.[31]
In December 2015, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel named Hinshaw Partner Sergio Acosta to the city's Task Force on Police Accountability, created out of response to the shooting of Ronald Johnson by a Chicago police officer.[32]

Seven Questions for the Man Shaking Up HP’s Operations, John Hinshaw


March 19, 2013 at 7:02 am PT

After the toughest year in its history, it may be a while before many HP employees have anything resembling a spring in their step, but the fact is that that there are early, encouraging signs that the turnaround CEO Meg Whitman is trying to engineer isn’t going to be impossible.
When the final book on HP is written (and, win or lose, you know there will be books), one of the primary characters will be John Hinshaw. A CIO by experience — his last job was as CIO at the defense and aerospace giant Boeing — Whitman hired him in late 2011 with the title of executive vice president of technology and operations. At any other company he would still carry the title of CIO, but in this case he has the CIO reporting up to him because his portfolio of responsibilities is wider. Not only is it his role to make HP’s fundamental decisions around IT, but also to reengineer internal processes for how HP does things.
Often you’ll hear Whitman talk about how she’s aiming to simplify how HP engages its customers, and about speeding up how decisions are made. Hinshaw is the man making that happen. He’s the one who has shifted HP to using many cloud-based software products like Salesforce.com, Workday and Docusign. And there will be more cloud deployments coming.
But he also sees his role as showing HP customers, both existing and potential, how IT can be done at a large scale, mixing cloud services with other approaches into something of a showcase, one that he intends to show off. I sat down with Hinshaw recently at HP headquarters in Palo Alto, and my first question was about his portfolio of responsibilities.
AllThingsD: John, I know it’s not your title, but I tend to think of you as HP’s CIO, in the sense that you’re the one who has been digging through the operational trenches looking for ways to improve operations and trim costs. And you did the deals with Salesforce.com and Workday. But my understanding of your portfolio of responsibilities stops there, so could you explain more?
Hinshaw: Sure. Most of my career I was in a CIO role with Boeing and Verizon. So it’s fun to see what’s going on at those companies now. During those years I was a huge HP customer, and so I bought billions worth of HP products and services over the years, and I knew the company pretty well before I came in. The thing that really attracted me to the job was that it would be well beyond what a typical CIO does. It was Meg’s idea for me to go hire a CIO — and I hired Ramon Baez — and for my job to cover a much broader operational portfolio.
So you have a CIO reporting up to you. Can you draw your lines of responsibility for me?
In addition to the CIO function, I run the Global Business Services Group, which is really shared services on steroids. It’s all the internal operations and processes, from executing payroll to marketing collateral to all the shared services across the company. It’s 18,000 people, and there’s a very global portfolio. Then I have global procurement for the entire company. That’s $32 billion of procurement. Then I have global real estate. And then I have global security, which is physical security, brand security and cyber security. Finally, there’s sales operations — all the invoicing, sales compensation work, everything that happens behind the scenes in sales. Meg’s idea was to marry up the IT function with all the other functions that keep the company going. And they’re fundamentally linked. So, let’s take the Salesforce deal. A lot of companies have deployed Salesforce, but if the IT organization is trying to do that, they are looking at it from the point of view of changing their systems and managing their data. When we did it, we looked at it from a process perspective. We designed our sales process, and then the system followed that. So we did the fastest rollout of Salesforce implementation ever. It was 30,000 employees and that made it the biggest ever, too. That’s the unique thing about what we’re doing at HP. I’ve never seen anywhere else that can move that fast at scale. Usually you have one or the other, but we have both.
What did moving to Salesforce, as a practical matter, do for you? What did you use before Salesforce and Workday? Did you see a big operational savings or cost savings?
We used Siebel and PeopleSoft. The big thing is that our sales teams can sell faster. They can now generate a quote right out of Salesforce.com, and could not do that before. They have a comprehensive view of the customer when they are in that product — whether selling software, hardware, services, it’s all right there. Their efficiency has gone up. Their satisfaction with their own work has gone up significantly. It was 7 percent. It’s now 70 percent. The second thing is the speed at which we can implement new functionality. We’ve done four releases so far, and we have a fifth one coming up. We can implement them much faster in Salesforce than we could before. We’re going to have this be the dashboard for the sales team, where they have everything in there. Contacts, contracts, commissions, everything in one spot. We’ve also licensed a product enterprise-wide called Docusign. When we would sign up a new reseller, it used to take five weeks in the whole transaction process. Now it’s five days. HP Financial Services would take two or three days of paperwork back and forth. Now it’s 10 minutes.
Let’s talk about security. We’ve all been hearing the chatter about hacking coming out of China, the warnings from the administration and other companies complaining about being attacked by China. We can only assume that HP has a lot of intellectual property, and would thus be another presumed target. Your networks are probably always being probed, if not overtly attacked. What are you doing about it?
Cyber security is a fascinating space. I learned a lot about it at Boeing. It’s extremely important when you’re dealing with aerospace and governments. The great news about HP is that we have the most comprehensive set of products and services designed for it, and internally I’m the biggest user of all those products and services. ArcSight records 20 billion events a day. We test that at scale before other customers get to use it. We scan all our code through Fortify to be sure there are no back doors and no issues. We’re the biggest user of that product, as well. We use Tipping Point to keep track of how well our network traffic is flowing, and we’ve got that standardized across HP. So my job in protecting HP is easier than it would be at other companies, because I have all these internal products at my disposal. And then we have a services business that also offers security, and they share information. We recently hired a new guy, Art Gilliland, from Symantec, to run HP’s security products. And Brett Whalen is our chief information security officer, and they’re linked up to make sure they’re building security into all our products, as well.
So let’s talk about 2013. Meg has called it the repair-and-rebuild year. What does that mean to you?
I think we are laying the operational foundation for the turnaround. Each unit has plans and strategies that they’re going to execute on. And they need technology and processes to make it happen. From the sales processes to, say, in our Enterprise Services business, to get the right sales tools to be able to execute there. For example, there’s a new matching tool that more effectively matches the labor force to what is needed in new contracts. So when you have a contract that is winding down, with 100 great security professionals, and there’s another contract over here that is similar, we can quickly match them up and go. That has really helped. We’re doing a lot as well in subcontracting. So when we win a contract we staff it with HP people, and then staff it with subcontractors, and there wasn’t a real automated process for that. So we’re implementing a tool called Fieldglass, a cloud-based product. From the moment a manager needs a subcontractor, to timekeeping and invoicing, it’s all in the cloud. Similar for our software business.
You must have had a lot of resistance, shaking things up as you did. HP is an older company with a lot of ingrained processes. What did you do about that? What was the biggest assumption you had to blow up?
It’s interesting. Because I think of the open communication style that Meg has created, there hasn’t really been a lot of resistance. I would have expected it. In fact, I think people were hungry for change, and more automated processes. If you look at the previous five or six years, there was less investment in IT, even though we’re the world’s largest IT company. It was more focused on cutting costs in the IT function than investing in tools. People were pretty excited about a new sales process and a new HR process. The area that required the most collaboration was in sales. You had to get all four business units on board with the same process, one view of the customer. That took a lot of upfront work to get that right, and everyone was used to doing it in a certain way. But we got there. Now we’re the largest Salesforce customer ever. We’re the largest Workday customer ever. We’re the largest Fieldglass customer ever. We’re the largest DocuSign customer ever.
Will you do more cloud deployments? Is there anything you won’t put on the cloud?
We will. We’re going to put all our travel booking on the cloud completely with a third-party provider. There will be more procurement. Right now, we’re using SAP’s Ariba. We’re implementing Hana, which will help us close our books faster. Workday will take us through the end of the year. Today, I think manufacturing and financials in the ERP and MRP space at this scale isn’t ready for the cloud yet. If you look at our SAP implementation today, manufacturing for financials, it’s running very well. So that’s running in-house on HP servers. I think in a few years it will be ready for the cloud. Right now, it’s about the complexity and scale, and the number of transactions that have to be processed at scale. I think it’s just a matter of time, but today the workloads are too large to run on the cloud.

            Latin Psalms composed by Peter Anglea in 2011. The third setting 
            is the widely successful Jubilate Deo published in 2014. In this 
            beautifully reflective piece, Non Nobis reminds us that " Not unto us, O Lord, 
            but to thy name give the glory". Easily successful either in a school 
            or church setting.

HMC2468
O Clap Your Hands (Lau, SATB, organ & opt. brass septet & timp.)
1.90



            This setting of Psalm 47 is an example of the masterful craft 
            of composer Robert Lau. This festival anthem is easily 
            successful on Palm Sunday, Christ the King, Ascension, or general celebratory use.
            

 

HMC2464
Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven (arr. Helvey, SATB organ, opt. cong.& brass quartet)
2.20



            With an original introductory section, this wonderful setting of 
            the well-loved hymn tune, LaudaAnima by John Goss, should 
            become a staple in every church choirs' repertoire. Very effective with 
            organ alone, or add the brass for a special celebration. Great for Christ 
            the King Sunday!

HMC2460
The Storm (Davidson, TBB, piano)
2.00



            A compelling piece conveying the dangers inherent in fishing 
            on the open sea, it also seeks to honor all men and women who 
            face dangerous working conditions, and the power of prayer. For 
            middle school or adult men.
            

 

HMC2494
This Is My Father's World (arr. Hagenberg, SATB, piano & violin)
2.00



            This is a new setting of the much loved hymn tune, Terra Beata 
            with text by Maltbie D. Babcock. The virtuousic violin part 
            beautifully complements the arrangement. In a worship setting the 
            piece has general use or whenever celebrating the power and 
            beauty of God's creation.
            

 

HMC2467
Watoto Waje (Bethel, SATB, opt. childrens choir, keyboard & opt. percussion)
2.00



            In this piece the title, which means "Let the Children Come" 
            in Swahili, is used as a refrain. The original verse text by Herb 
            Frombach tells us that Jesus loves us all, especially the children. 
            This is a perfect piece for your adult and children's choirs to sing 
            together. The optional percussion addsa rhythmic intensity, and requires 
            three players. Try it for confirmation or Festival of the Christian Home.
            

 

HMC2471
We Give You Thanks (Psalm 100) (Moose, SATB. piano)
1.70



            A wonderful Thanksgiving or general worship anthem with a 
            very memorable refrain, the work is accessible for small 
            church choirs—both youth and adult.
            

 

HMC2475
With Wondering Awe (arr. Harmon, SATB, piano or opt. harp & wind quintet)

Hinshaw Music Secular,  2016





HMC2486
The Arrow and the Song (Waters, SATB, divisi, a cappella)
1.90



            This fascinating text by Longfellow is skillfully set here for 
            high school as well ascollege and professional choirs. Try it 
            during American Music Month or as a commencement anthem. 
            

 

HMC2459
As the rain hides the stars (Hagenberg, SSA, opt. Solo or descant), piano
1.90



            In this very powerful, exquisite setting of the traditional 
            Gaelic Prayer, Elaine Hagenberg vividly presents the initial image of longing 
            and unrest to the ultimate resolution ofassurance that "Though I 
            may stumble in my going, You do not fall". 
            

 

HMC2492
Bile Them Cabbage Down (arr. Wilberg/adapt. Rodde, TTBB tenor solo, piano (four-hands), opt. fiddle, guitar, woodblock, tambourine & strings)
2.50



            Mack Wilberg's very successful SATB arrangement of this rousing 
            American folksong has been ably set here for male chorus. Although 
            the piece can be effectively performed with piano accompaniment alone, 
            the optional fiddle, buitar, woodblock, tambourine and string bass will 
            add just the right kick.
            

 

HPC7103
Cantate (Dittmar, SATB, divisi, a cappella)
2.00



            The driving bass line along with the soaring soprano part of 
            this energetic Psalm 96:1 setting creates a performance that will 
            delight audiences of all ages. It was written, andpremiered when the 
            composer was a senior at Sanderson High School in Raleigh, NC. Perfect for 
            a festival or honor choir concert.
            

 

HMC2481
A Cherokee Hymn (featuring The Cherokee Morning and Evening Hymns) (arr. Green, SA or opt. SAB, descant ( or solo), 
a cappella, or opt. flute (or violin opt. Shaker, Tambourine, Drum and Bongos (or Congas)
2.00



            James Green continues his efforts to keep the Cherokee language 
            alive with this riveting arrangement of a traditional Cherokee Hymn. 
            This hymn was sung on the "Trail of Tears" and is still a 
            favoriteamong the Cherokee people. This arrangement features the true 
            Cherokee Morning and Evening Hymns. An authentic performance can be 
            achieved by using the phonetic pronunciation guide that is 
            included. A versatile arrangement with many voicing options, this piece would be a great 
            addition to any program. Especially powerful for American Music Month.
            

 

HMC2491
Die Lotosblume (Schumann/ed. Oltman,TTBB, a cappella)
1.70



            On a text of Heinrich Henne, this modern edition of the 
            Schumann classic is here made available to the advanced college/university 
            or high school festival chorus. Consider pairing it with other 
            classics by Brahms or Schubert.
            

 

HMC2461
Dies Sanctificatus (Bernarducci, SATB, divisi, a cappella)
2.00



            This lively and energetic piece for a cappella mixed chorus 
            with divisi would be a perfect AllState, Festival, or Honor choir choice.
            

 

HMC2485
Don't Be Seen (Hill, 3 pt. mixed, piano & opt. cello)
2.20



            Written originally for a middle school honor chorus, this 
            energetic piece with optionalcello can be successful for voices of all 
            ages. It's perfect for the festival or honor choir setting!
            

 

HMC2482
Further Goals (Dake, SATB, divisi, a cappella)
1.90



            Scored for a cappella mixed chorus with divisi, this setting of 
            the adapted Emily Dickinson text would work especially well as 
            a commencement anthem – whether in an auditorium, on an 
            athletic field, or in a gymnasium. It's the latest contribution to 
            the Songs of the World Series edited by Andre de Quadros.
            

 

HMC2489
Home on the Range (Hayes, TTBB, piano & opt.harmonica or other C inst. or clarinet)
1.90



            This concert showpiece and arrangement of the popular folk 
            song starts with a lone harmonica, and builds to lush choral 
			harmonies. If harmonica is not available, try another C instrument such as oboe.
            

 

HMC2484
I Am Loved (Harris, SATB, divisi, piano)
1.90



            The driving rhythm of the accompaniment along with 
            the bold choral writing in thissetting of the Sara Teasdale 
            poem, Joy, beautifully conveys the strong message of love. 
            Another addition to the Andre Thomas Choral Series and an 
            excellent choice for festival or honor choirs.
            

 

HMC2487
In Meeting We Are Blessed (Robertson, SATB, a cappella, djembe)
1.90



            With an original text inspired by John Donne, this 
            piece illustrates the power of peace, and allthe blessings it 
            brings. Written for the meeting of the Nairobi Chamber Chorus 
            and FestivalSingers of Florida, it was premiered in Nairobi 
            with the composer singing in the choir. It's lovely, lilting melody 
            will appeal to choirs of all ages.
            

 

HMC2483
Invictus (Marshall, SSATB, a cappella)
1.70



            This setting of the poignant, inspirational poem by William 
            Ernest Henley, about conqueringlife's dark moments, and becoming 
            a master of your fate. Appropriate for mixed choirs of allages 
            including high school.
            

 

HMC2462
Love's Fool (Robertson, TTBB, piano) 
1.90



            This setting of the John Donne poem, The Triple Fool, for 
            male chorus with piano, has a slightly "bluesy" feel. Also included is 
            a line-by-line study of the poem by composer Dr. Troy Robertson. 
            It's an excellent way to introduce John Donne to high school or 
            even college singers.
            

 

HMC2490
One Voice (Shelton, SSA, solo & audience (or descant) piano & violin)
2.00



            This lyrical composition provides many opportunities for 
            developing musical and non-musicalskills and understandings. It was 
            commissioned for the 2014 North Carolina Elementary Honors Chorus, but is also 
            suitable for adult women.
            

 

HMC2488
Refuge (Hagenberg, SATB, piano and cello)
2.20



            This brilliant setting of the powerful Sara Teasdale poem, 
            Refuge, reminds us that in singing we have a refuge from all our strife 
            and stress. A wonderful inspirational addition to any choir's repertoire.
            

 

HMC2479
An Sylvia (Schubert/arr. Bohlin, SATB, divisi, piano)
1.70



            One of Schubert's three settings of Shakespeare texts from 
            July 1826, this new choral arrangement would be perfect for both 
            high school and college choirs, as well as professional groups. 
            Consider a group of Schubert songs for your next concert.
            

 

HMC2480
Winter Roses (Bernarducci, SSA, piano)
1.70



            Another outstanding addition to the Andre Thomas Series, this 
            is a lovely setting of the John Greenleaf Whittier poem for 
            women's voices. Try it during American Music Monthor part of your 
            winter choral concert.

Boeing CIO John M Hinshaw knows a thing or two about how to run an IT department.Hinshaw joined the aviation giant Boeing two and a half years ago as its global CIO, where he oversees all IT, including infrastructure, security, and IT revenue generating opportunities for Boeing's airline and government customers.The CIO role is one of the few roles where you get to see every part of the company -- every product and serviceJohn M. Hinshaw, global chief information officer, BoeingPrior to joining Boeing, Hinshaw spent 14 years in a range of different key IT positions at US mobile carrier Verizon Wireless, eventually working his way up to CIO and earning Verizon's IT organisation a top 15 ranking in Computerworld's 2006 Best Places to Work in IT awards along the way.
In 2009, Hinshaw was named CIO of the year by the Executives' Club of Chicago and the Association of Information Technology Professionals, and he was also recently honoured with the Top Ten Leaders and Change Agents Award at the Global CIO Summit. This year, Boeing's IT organisation was honoured by Baseline magazine as one of five leaders in business-technology convergence. Additionally, for the second straight year the Uptime Institute presented Boeing IT with an award for world-class data centre operations.According to Hinshaw, the scale and scope of the products and services Boeing offers is unrivalled by any other company in the world. The scale and complexity of IT at Boeing is also much larger and more complex than anything he experienced at his previous roles.With 3500 employees in Australia, including several hundred in IT, Australia is Boeing's largest base outside the US and a large market for the company. Hinshaw describes Boeing’s IT souring model as "balanced", but says services are predominantly delivered in-house because of the nature of the work involved. Boeing’s sourcing ratio stands at about 25 per cent sourced labour and 75 per cent in-house. Hinshaw says others have done more, but it is less so in the defence and aerospace industries.Recently in Australia to meet with the staff and customers, including the Department of Defence in Canberra and Australian government CIO Ann Steward, Hinshaw spoke with CIO about rationalising IT, surviving the financial crisis, SaaS and cloud computing, migrating 200,000 desktops to Windows 7 and what it takes to be a good IT leader.What are some of you cost reduction strategies?No CIO is ever happy with costs. It's a constant mission to get costs lower. Every dollar spent at Boeing on IT could be spent on product development. We spend less on IT every year and get more value out of it.Boeing has renegotiated better terms with key suppliers and prioritised its IT work. We have tried to balance where the work is done and we are now more certain outsourced work gives good value for the dollar.With about 160,000 employees in 90 countries Boeing has a lot of suppliers and needs to better leverage 'the one Boeing' across the company. I can buy IT products globally as opposed to in any one country, which saves money.What are the most pressing issues for Boeing a year after the GFC?The good thing about our business is there is a $US320 billion backlog of defence and airline orders. The number of orders for new planes has gone down, but we will deliver more planes in 2009 than in 2008. There is still demand in emerging markets and new planes are 20 to 30 per cent more efficient that older aircraft.We have weathered the GFC well. We are more judicious where we spend IT capital. The Dreamliner had some delays, which put pressure on it, but we hope to fly it this month.How is Boeing’s housekeeping going? Are you rationalising the number of systems, staff, etc?When I came on board the number one priority was to simplify IT operations. In 2007 we had 10,000 corporate applications company-wide.Each business had their own IT shops. We brought them all together and have been rationalising applications at a rate of around 1000 a year, so this year it will be 8000.We also had about 60 data centres and are down to six today. Our roadmap is to have three, which will save significant cost reduction in the power drain.Do you find it ironic that increasing use of technology (for example, telepresence) may be reducing the need for flights, thus impacting Boeing’s business?We use videoconferencing in Boeing and we also travel a bit. There are times where videoconferencing makes sense and times when a face-to-face meeting makes sense.We want people to travel so there is a little bit of dichotomy, but at the end of the day what is the business need?
