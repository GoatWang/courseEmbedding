Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Canvas Prints
Canvas prints are one of the most popular styles of wall art due to their simplicity, lightweight, and relatively low cost.   In order to manufacturer canvas prints, high-resolution artwork images get printed onto tightly woven cotton canvases, and then the canvases get stretched around rectangular frames of durable, wooden stretcher bars.   Mounting hooks or hanging wires get attached to the back, and that's it!   You get a simple, elegant, museum-quality masterpiece which is ready to hang on your wall.   You can customize your canvas print by specifying the print dimensions, the canvas type (glossy or matte), and the color of the side wrap (black, white, or mirrored).   For an upscale appearance, you can also add a floater frame which surrounds your print and offsets it slightly from the wall.   We have hundreds of floater frames to choose from.


Art Prints
An art print is simply a piece of artwork (e.g. a painting, illustration, or photograph) which gets digitized and then printed onto a museum-quality grade of paper.   We offer seven different paper types which are designed for specific styles of images: archival matte paper, glossy photo paper, luster photo paper, semi-matte photo paper, picture rag, somerset velvet, watercolor paper, and metallic paper.   No matter which paper you select, your art print gets produced using archival inks which are designed to last for 75+ years without fading or loss of color.   In order to transform your art print into wall art, you'll need to select a frame and/or mat so that your print can be easily mounted on your wall.   We have hundreds of different frames and mats to choose from.


Posters
Posters are one of the first types of wall art that we all encounter / own in life.   As a young child, you probably had posters of your favorite athletes, musicians, and actors hanging on your walls.   Posters are simply "art prints" which are produced on a lower cost papers.   They're very thin and are designed to be hung on your walls using tape or another sticky adhesive, but they can also be framed and matted, if desired.


Framed Prints
Select an art print (see above)... add a mat... add a frame... and you're got a framed print.   Frame prints are a universal type of wall art which work perfectly in all settings.   You can hang them in any house style (e.g. modern, southwest, etc.) and in any room, and they'll instantly transform the mood based on your selected images and frames.   We have hundreds of different frames to choose from ranging from low-cost, metallic black frames up to highly-ornate, wooden frames embelished with gold accents.   All of our framed prints are hand-crafted in 3 - 4 business days by our expert staff of custom framers and delivered to you ready-to-hang with mounting hooks, hanging wire, and nails.   The right frame can transform almost any image into high-end work of art, and the right frame plus the right image can create a truly spectacular addition to the wall art in your home or office.


Metal Prints
Metal prints are a relatively new style of wall art which get produced by printing images directly onto 1/8" thick sheets of polished aluminum.   The results are sleek, modern, and visually stunning.   Metal prints are a favorite among photographers and photo-enthusiasts because they make photographic images really pop, but having said that, you'll often see paintings and illustrations printing on metal, as well.   Part of the beauty of a metal print is its simplicity.   It's just the image... printed on sheet of metal... with a hanging wire on the back.   Metal prints can be found extensively through commercial office spaces, airports, hospitals, and other public settings, and you'll find them in many modern-style homes, as well.


Wood Prints
Wood prints are perfect for adding a rustic feel to any image.   They're produced by printing images directly onto 3/4" sheets of maple wood, and the printing technique allows the subtle grain and texture of the wood to slightly show through and accent the image.   The results are warm, Earthy, and vintage inspired.   Due to the natural association with "nature", you'll find wood prints used extensively as wall art in rustic environments such as cabins, vacation homes, home offices, travel agencies, and more... but this is one the most under-utilized type of wall art that we offer - wood prints look absolutely incredible in any environment.   We use them throughout our own "startup office space" here in Southern California which is filled with towering white wall, lots of natural sunlight, and views of the Pacific Ocean.   You don't have to be out in the woods to appreciate the beauty of these wood prints.


Painted Portaits (Photos-to-Art)
Transform your personal photos into originals work of art - digitally hand-painted with care by a master artist.   No Photoshop filters.   No simulated brush strokes.   Your photo becomes a one-of-a-kind masterpiece signed by the artist.   All you have to do is upload your image, select our "Painted Portrait" option on the upload screen, customize your photo with a frame and/or mat, and you're done.   A master artist will transform your photo into a digitally hand-painted work of art, and your framed masterpiece will be on its way back to you within 4 - 5 business days.   This is an incredibly easy, visually-stunning way to transform your personal photos and wall art for your home.
