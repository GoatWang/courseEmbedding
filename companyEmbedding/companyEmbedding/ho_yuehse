Description:

PRIORITY CLAIMThis application is a continuation and claims the priority benefit of a U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/077,720 filed Mar. 31, 2011, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.TECHNOLOGY FIELDThis invention relates to a power semiconductor device, especially to a package structure that combines semiconductor chips and other components in the same power semiconductor device.BACKGROUNDCurrently, a typical power semiconductor device usually combines metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and an integrated circuit (IC) controller in one package to reduce number of peripheral devices and improve the utilization efficiency of power supplies and other components. For a double diffused metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (DMOSFET) having a source on its top surface, the top source of the chip usually is connected to an exposed die paddle of a lead frame and thus is grounded.To achieve the above said package structure, the chip has to be flipped and attached to the lead frame die paddle, which will face some difficulties, such as the optimization of the size and simplification of the shape of the exposed die paddle of lead frame, the achievement of the connection between the chip source and the die paddle to optimize heat dissipation, and the achievement of a good interconnection between the gate on top of the chip and the IC controller for such a flip chip configuration.A specific existing semiconductor device package as shown in FIG. 1 is made according to the circuit diagram in FIG. 2, which contains a P-type high-side (HS) MOSFET, a N-type low-side (LS) MOSFET and an IC controller that are installed on one lead frame. The installation space of the package limits the size of the HS MOSFET, LS MOSFET and IC controller, which have a great impact on the improvement of performance of power semiconductor device.However, in the above package structure, electrodes on top surface of the LS MOSFET connect to the HS MOSFET, the IC controller or external components directly through bonding wires, which may be connected to the same pin. Therefore, it is difficult to install a flip chip to connect the source on its top surface with the die paddle, and it is impossible to make the exposed die paddle as electrode ground and to improve the heat dissipation effect.SUMMARYThis invention provides a combined packaged, or co-packaged, power semiconductor device including semiconductor chips, such as HS and LS MOSFETs with top source, top gate and bottom drain, and an IC controller in one package. The overall size of co-packaged power semiconductor device is reduced, and the size of the semiconductor chips is enlarged with the same package size, which effectively improve the performance of semiconductor device. The electrical connection between the source of the flip chip with the die paddle is achieved and the exposed area at the bottom surface of the die paddle is grounded and maximized that improves heat dissipation.This invention provides methods of combined packaging for the above power semiconductor device. The method is started with a lead frame including a die paddle and a plurality of pins that are separated and electrically insulated from the die paddle. The LS MOSFET chip is flipped and stacked on the die paddle, forming an electrical connection between the LS source and a top surface of the die paddle, thus the LS source is grounded through the exposed bottom surface of the die paddle. A first metal interconnection plate is attached on the drain of the LS MOSFET. HS MOSFET is either directly attached or flipped first and then attached on the first metal interconnection plate, forming electrical connections between a drain of HS MOSFET or a source of flipped HS MOSFET and the drain of the LS MOSFET through the first metal interconnection plate.A second metal interconnection plate is attached on and electrically connected to the source of HS MOSFET or the drain of flipped HS MOSFET. The IC controller is also stacked on the die paddle. The IC controller includes a plurality of electrodes and electrical connections between the pins of the lead frame, the electrodes on the IC controller and the electrodes of HS and LS MOSFETs are formed through bonding wires.In a preferred embodiment, the lead frame pins include a LS gate pin including an outer portion and an inner portion. A matching gap is made on said die paddle at the corresponding position to that of inner portion to separate the LS gate pin from the die paddle. The gate of the flipped LS MOSFET is attached on the inner portion and thus forms an electrical connection with the LS gate pin. The inner portion of the LS gate pin includes a half etched area, which is filled with plastic material in packaging process The half etched area is also formed on a side of the die paddle corresponding to the inner portion with a width matching to that of the inner portion and is also filled with plastic material in packaging process to enhance the connection strength in the device and maximizes the exposed bottom surface of the die paddle. The IC controller is electrically connected to the LS gate pin's outer portion through bonding wires.In another preferred embodiment, the combined packaged power semiconductor device also includes a second interposer. The gate of flipped LS MOSFET is attached and electrically connected to a conductive top surface of the second interposer. The bottom surface of the second interposer is attached to and electrically insulated from die paddle. The source of the flipped LS MOSFET is electrically connected to the die paddle through a thick conductive adhesive.In an improved structure of this embodiment, a second groove is formed in a top portion of the die paddle corresponding to the position of the gate of the LS MOSFET. The second interposer is placed in the second groove and is electrically insulated from the die paddle. The second interposer can be a conductive metal plate, which is attached on the die paddle or in the second groove through a non-conductive adhesive at its bottom surface. Alternatively, the second interposer maybe include a conductive metal upper layer and an insulated lower layer with the bottom surface of the insulated lower layer attached on the die paddle in the second groove through either conductive or non-conductive adhesive. The IC controller is electrically connected to the top surface of the second interposer, thus forming electrical connection with gate of the flipped LS MOSFET.In another preferred embodiment, the IC controller is attached to and electrically insulated from the die paddle. The flipped LS MOSFET is attached to and covers a portion at top surface of the IC controller, thus electrical connection between some electrodes on the IC controller and the gate and a portion of source of the LS MOSFET are formed, which eliminates the utilization of bonding wires and simplifies the packaging process. Furthermore, the IC controller is also packaged three-dimensionally in this structure, thus reducing the overall thickness of power semiconductor device. The remaining portion of the sources of LS MOSFET is electrically connected to the die paddle through a thick conductive adhesive.In an improved structure of this embodiment, a chip groove is formed on a top portion of the die paddle. The IC controller is then placed in the chip groove and is electrically insulated from the die paddle. The combined packaged power semiconductor device also includes the first interposer. The gate of the flipped HS MOSFET is electrically connected to the conductive top surface of the first interposer.The bottom surface of the first interposer is attached on and electrically insulated from the first metal interconnection plate. The source of the HS MOSFET is electrically connected to the first metal connectors through a thick conductive adhesive.In an improved structure of this embodiment, a first groove is formed on a top portion of the first metal interconnection plate corresponding to the position of the gate of the HS MOSFET for housing the first interposer that is electrically insulated from the first metal interconnection plate. The first interposer can be a conductive metal plate, which is attached on the first metal interconnection plate or in the first groove through a non-conductive adhesive at its bottom surface. Alternatively, the first interposer may include a conductive metal upper layer and an insulated lower layer with the bottom surface of the insulated lower layer attached on the first metal interconnection plate or in the first groove through either a conductive or a non-conductive adhesive. The IC controller is electrically connected to the top surface of the first interposer, forming electrical connection with the gate of the flipped HS MOSFET. Source and gate of the HS MOSFET or bottom drain of flipped HS MOSFET are electrically connected to the IC controller by bonding wires.The lead frame pins also include switch pins that are electrically connected with the first metal interconnection plate. The IC controller is connected to the switch pins through bonding wires, thus forming electrical connections with the first metal interconnection plate. The lead frame pins also includes HS source pins electrically connected to the source of the HS MOSFET through the second metal interconnection plate.

According to the circuit diagram as shown in FIG. 3, this power semiconductor device package includes the IC controller 40 and both N-type HS and LS MOSFETs.The structure of the lead frame that includes a die paddle 100 and a plurality of pins and the connecting configuration of the IC controller 40 and LS MOSFET 20 on the die paddle 100 are same as that described above in FIG. 4.Typically, as shown in FIG. 5, FIG. 6 and FIG. 8, the flipped LS MOSFET 20 is connected on the die paddle 100, with its source 22 being electrically connected with the die paddle 100, and its top gate 21 being electrically connected with the inner portion 711 of the LS gate pin 71. The first metal interconnection plates 51 stacks on top of the LS MOSFET chip 20, forming an electrical connection between drain 23 of the LS MOSFET 20 and the switch pin 74. The die paddle 100 is also connected to the IC controller 40, forming an electrical connection between IC controller 40 and the control pins 75, outer portion 712 of LS gate pin 71, and the switch pin 74 by bonding wires 80. The half etched areas 104 and 713 are filled with plastic material in packaging process. All pins (including the outer portion 712 of LS gate pin 71) and area of bottom surface of die paddle 100, except the half etched area 104, expose from the bottom surface of the power semiconductor device.In this embodiment, the HS MOSFET 30 is an N-type MOSFET and is also flipped.

By way of example, the first interposer 61 can be a conductive metal plate, with its bottom surface being attached to the first metal connector 51 in the first groove 511 through non-conductive adhesive 92. Alternatively, the first interposer 61 may include a top conductive metal layer and a bottom insulator layer, such as a glass layer, in which the bottom surface of this bottom insulator layer can be connected with the first metal interconnection plate 51 in the first groove 511 through conductive or nonconductive adhesive.Top surface of the first interposer 61 is electrically connected with the gate 31 of the HS MOSFET 30 through conductive adhesive 91. The top surface of the first interposer 61 is not completely covered by the gate 31 and the boding wire 80 is formed between the IC controller 40 and the first interposer 61 achieving an electrical connection between IC controller 40 and the gate 31 of the HS MOSFET 30.The second metal interconnection plate 52 is attached on top of the HS MOSFET 30 through conductive adhesive 91, forming an electrical connection between drain 33 of the HS MOSFET 30 and the second metal interconnection plate 52, and further forming an electrical connection with the HS drain pin 73 through the second metal interconnection plate 52, forming a power access terminal Vin as shown in FIG. 3.

According to the circuit diagram as shown in FIG. 2, a P-type HS MOSFET 30, an N-type LS MOSFET 20 and an IC controller 40 are co-packaged in this power semiconductor device.Similar to the structure of the power semiconductor devise as described above in FIG. 4, the IC controller 40 is placed at one end of the die paddle 100 of leads frame, and the flipped LS MOSFET 20, the first metal connector 51, HS MOSFET 30 and the second metal connector 52 are placed at the other end of the die paddle 100. The top surface and bottom surface of the first metal interconnection plate 51 are electrically connected with drain 23 and 33 of the HS and LS MOSFETs 20 and 30 respectively, and further connected the switch pin 74. Bonding wires 80 form an electrical connection between the switch pin 74 and the IC controller 40, forming the switch terminal Lx as shown in FIG. 2.

A second interposer 62 is formed in the second groove 102, and is electrically insulated from the die paddle 100.Specifically, similar to the first interposer 61, the second interposer 62 can be a conductive metal plate, with its bottom surface being attached to the die paddle 100 in the second groove 102 through a non-conductive adhesive 92. Alternatively, the second interposer 62 may include a top conductive metal layer and a bottom glass layer or other insulator layers, with the bottom insulator layer connecting to the die paddle 100 through either a conductive or a nonconductive adhesive.The gate 21 of the flipped LS MOSFET 20 can be electrically connected to the conductive top surface of the second interposer 62 through conductive adhesive 91. The second interposer 62 is not completely covered by the gate 21, so that a bonding wire 80 is formed between the IC controller 40 and the second interposer 62, achieving an electrical connection between IC controller 40 and the gate 21 of the LS MOSFET 20. At the same time, source 22 of the LS MOSFET 20 can be electrically connected with the top surface of the die paddle 100 through conductive adhesive 91, and grounded as shown in FIG. 2. As the second interposer 62 in this embodiment is placed in the second groove 102 of the die paddle 100, the LS gate pin 71 in FIG. 4 can be replaced with a control pin 75. In this embodiment the bottom surface of the die paddle 100 completely exposes outside the power semiconductor device after its being packaged as shown in FIG. 13, achieving a larger heat dissipating area.An alternative configuration of the power semiconductor device is described in FIG. 3, FIG. 7, FIG. 10 and FIG. 11. FIG. 10 is a three-dimensional diagram of the power semiconductor device co-package, while FIG. 7 and FIG. 11 are cross-sectional views of the power semiconductor device co-package in FIG. 10 along line C-C and line B-B respectively.

Gate 31 of the flipped N-type HS MOSFET 30 is electrically connected with the conductive top surface of the first interposer 61. At the same time, source 32 of the HS MOSFET 30 is electrically connected with the top surface of the first metal interconnection plate 51, therefore electrically connected to the drain 23 of the LS MOSFET 20, and the switch pin 74, forming a switch terminal Lx, as shown in FIG. 3. The second metal interconnection plate 52 located above the drain 33 of the HS MOSFET 30 is electrically connected to the HS drain pin 73, forming a power access terminal Vin as shown in FIG. 3. The IC controller 40 is electrically connected to the control pins 75, top conductive surface of the first and second interposers 61 and 62, the switch pin 74, and drain 33 of the HS MOSFET 30 through the bonding wires 80.As shown in FIG. 13, the whole bottom surface of die paddle 100 in this embodiment can be exposed completely outside the power semi-conductor device after being packaged as a ground, as such the source 22 of HS MOSFET 20 is also grounded as shown in FIG. 3. The exposed bottom surface of die paddle 100 improves heat dissipation.FIG. 12 is an alternative structure of FIG. 11. As shown in FIG. 12, the flipped LS MOSFET 20 is stacked on top of the die paddle 100 through conductive adhesive 91 forming an electrical connection between the source 22 of LS MOSFET 20 and the die paddle 100. The second interposer 62 is stacked on top and insulated from the die paddle 100 with the top surface of second interposer 62 electrically connected to the gate 21 through conductive adhesive. The conductive adhesive 91 between the LS MOSFET 20 and the die paddle 100 is thick enough such that the top surface of the conductive adhesive 91 between the LS MOSFET 20 and the die paddle 100 and the top surface of the conductive adhesive between the second interposer 62 and the LS MOSFET 20 are co-planar.A third embodiment of the present invention is described in FIG. 2, FIG. 14 and FIG. 16, in which, FIG. 14 is a three-dimensional diagram of the power semiconductor device, and FIG. 16 is a cross-sectional view of the power semiconductor device in FIG. 14 along line D-D.

This chip groove 103 has a shape and size conforming to the shape and size of the IC controller 40, such that the IC controller 40 can be positioned in the chip groove 103 and is insulated from the die paddle 100.For example, a chip groove 103 of a depth of 4 μm can be formed by half etching for an IC controller 40 with a height of 4 μm, making top surface of the IC controller 40 located in the chip groove 103 at the same level with the top surface of the die paddle 100. The flipped LS MOSFET 20 covers a portion of top surface of the IC controller 40, with its gate 21 and a portion of source 22 being directly electrically connected with some electrodes on top surface of the IC controller 40 through conductive adhesive 91, which eliminates the utilization of the bonding wire and simplifies the packaging process. The remaining sources 22 of the LS MOSFET 20 is electrically connected with top surfaces of the die paddle 100 excluding the chip groove 103 through a conductive adhesive 91. The bottom surface of the die paddle 100 can be exposed completely outside the power semi-conductor device after being packaged, as shown in FIG. 13, resulting the remaining of source 22 of the LS MOSFET 20 being grounded as shown in FIG. 2. The exposed bottom surface of die paddle 100 also improves heat dissipation.

In this embodiment, the IC controller 40 is placed in the chip groove 103 of the die paddle 100 and the LS MOSFET 20 is stacked on top of the IC controller 40, forming a three-dimensional package structure. Thus, in this embodiment, the LS MOSFET 20 and the IC controller 40 can be placed on different planes in the die paddle 100 with the same area, as such each of them can enlarge their own area to improve the performance of the power semi-conductor device.An alternative configuration is described in FIG. 3, FIG. 7, FIG. 15 and FIG. 16, in which, FIG. 15 is a three-dimensional diagram of the power semiconductor device, while FIG. 7 and FIG. 15 are cross-sectional views of the power semiconductor device in FIG. 15 along line C-C and line D-D respectively.
