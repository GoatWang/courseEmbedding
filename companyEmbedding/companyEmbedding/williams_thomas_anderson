   0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10+What is a Powerpole "Kit"? Anderson Power Products Powerpole connectors are available as convenient connector kits or separate individual parts.A connector "Kit" includes all the parts needed for a single connector. A set includes (1) colored plastic housing and (2) metal contacts.To purchase a mating connector pair, you must order a quantity of two connector kits.SB Powerpole connectors are Color Keyed A unique feature of the SB Series Powerpole housings are that they are keyed to only mate with the same color housing. For example, a gray color will only connect with the same gray color SB housing. The Red color will only connect to a red colored connector, etc. The exception for SB50 is the black housing which also mates with the gray housing.This feature can be used to color code different voltages or systems and prevent accidental connection.Gauge Option SB Series Powerpole connectors are available in a wide range of gauge contact options. It is important that the correct gauge option is chosen to match your cable selection. All gauges shown throughout the Powerwerx website are American Wire Gauge (AWG).Powerpole connectors are both genderless and polarized connectors Powerpole connectors are genderless, meaning the supply and load connectors are the same. Since there are no male or female parts, all Powerpole connectors mate with themselves.Powerpole connectors are polarized, meaning the design is unique to prevent accidental reverse polarity connection. Only the positive (+) can be connected to positive (+) and negative (-) can be connected to negative (-). Connections can be quickly made and remade sightlessly or in the dark.The Anderson Powerpole SB Series connector family The Powerpole family spans a range of sizes covering up to 350 amps and accepting a different gauges of wire from 10 thru 4/0 AWG. Here is a size comparison diagram for the 50, 120, 175, 350 amp Powerpole Housings:High current rating, low resistance The size of the wire a Powerpole contact will accept is the primary limitation of their ability to carry a load. Powerpole connectors will safely handle higher loads or surges, please read the linked data sheets (PDF) for additional information.The contacts are made of highly conductive silver-plated copper for minimal contact resistance at high currents. The average contact resistance is 500 micro-ohms.Flat wiping contact system This system allows for minimal contact resistance at high current. The self-wiping action cleans contact surfaces during connection/disconnection. The contacts are rated at 10,000 no-load connect/disconnect cycles. When two pairs are mated together, it takes approximately 15 pounds of tension to pull them apart.Stainless steel spring Good connectors should not loose contact tension under use or vibration. Powerpole connectors use a stainless steel spring which applies 50 lbs. of pressure to hold the silver-plated copper contacts firmly together and maintain constant contact. This is ideal for frequent connect/disconnect cycles. Other cheaper connectors simply depend upon soft copper that eventually spreads apart and becomes loose.Durable polycarbonate housing The Powerpole insulated housings use a durable, high impact-resistant, high temperature polycarbonate plastic with a UL94 V-0 flammability rating. The connector design allows air to flow through the housing, assisting in cooling.Additional accessories include handles, boots and dust covers A variety of Powerpole accessories are available including weather resistant dust caps, corrosion proof safety boots, connector handle kits, strain relief cable clamps and more.Powerpole® and SB® are registered trademarks of Anderson Power Products, Inc.Related ProductsQuick View SB50 Environmental Boot with Cover, Source Side$10.99SKU: 3-6055P2   Quick View Powerwerx Handheld Hex Crimper for Large SB Series and Powerpole Connectors1$89.99SKU: SBcrimp   Quick View SB50 SB Series Connector Red Handle Kit with HardwareAs Low As $3.99SKU: SB50HDLRed   Customers who purchased this item also purchasedQuick View Dust Cover for SB50 SB Series 50 Amp Housings1$3.49SKU: DUST-SB50   Quick View Corrosion Proof Safety Boot for SB50 Amp HousingsAs Low As $3.29SKU: Boot-SB50   Quick View SB50 SB Series Connector Red Handle Kit with HardwareAs Low As $3.99SKU: SB50HDLRed   Quick View Powerwerx Economy Crimping Tool for 75 amp Powerpole and SB50 SB Series Connectors$16.99SKU: CT-75   Downloads  SB Series SB50 Data Sheet  (890KB)     5900 6 AWG Contact Drawing  (61KB)    5915 10 AWG Contact Drawing  (75KB)    5952 8 AWG Contact Drawing  (57KB)    SB Series SB50 Housing Drawing  (123KB)  Customer ReviewsPower pole and Odyssey battery  By  Jim  I've been using these connectors for many years with my odyssey batteries. They are perfect for emergency use and can carry the high output of the battery. If you are soldering the connector, use a soldering gun for the best results. I have also used the SB - 50 in a vacuum chamber and the design of the connector prevented arc over in the low pressure. This made setup of experiments very convenient.Was this review helpful?  Yes No   (4/0)  Use a crimper  By  Bill Dornbush  The info sheet indicated you could use either soldering or crimping. I tried to solder but gave up while waiting for my #10 wire and large connector to heat enough. I got a non-insulated crimper and that worked fine.  Once I got the wires crimped to the connector, all worked as I expected.Was this review helpful?  Yes No   (7/0)  be careful with colors  By  bill bourn  The smaller connectors all mate with each other allowing creativity in coding your circuits and identifying which cables connect to each other. From the SB50 specification PDF: Mechanical keys ensure connectors will only mate with connectors of the same color. Different color housings are selected to identify voltages, thus preventing mismatching of the power supply system.Was this review helpful?  Yes No   (11/0)  Very versitile  By  Thomas  I have used these extensively with our teardrop trailer. Easy to use and work reliably, what more can you wantWas this review helpful?

   0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10+What is a Powerpole "Kit"? Anderson Power Products Powerpole connectors are available as convenient connector kits or separate individual parts.A connector "Kit" includes all the parts needed for a single connector. A set includes (1) colored plastic housing and (2) metal contacts.To purchase a mating connector pair, you must order a quantity of two connector kits.SB Powerpole connectors are Color Keyed A unique feature of the SB Series Powerpole housings are that they are keyed to only mate with the same color housing. For example, a gray color will only connect with the same gray color SB housing. The Red color will only connect to a red colored connector, etc. The exception for SB50 is the black housing which also mates with the gray housing.This feature can be used to color code different voltages or systems and prevent accidental connection.Gauge Option SB Series Powerpole connectors are available in a wide range of gauge contact options. It is important that the correct gauge option is chosen to match your cable selection. All gauges shown throughout the Powerwerx website are American Wire Gauge (AWG).Powerpole connectors are both genderless and polarized connectors Powerpole connectors are genderless, meaning the supply and load connectors are the same. Since there are no male or female parts, all Powerpole connectors mate with themselves.Powerpole connectors are polarized, meaning the design is unique to prevent accidental reverse polarity connection. Only the positive (+) can be connected to positive (+) and negative (-) can be connected to negative (-). Connections can be quickly made and remade sightlessly or in the dark.The Anderson Powerpole SB Series connector family The Powerpole family spans a range of sizes covering up to 350 amps and accepting a different gauges of wire from 10 thru 4/0 AWG. Here is a size comparison diagram for the 50, 120, 175, 350 amp Powerpole Housings:High current rating, low resistance The size of the wire a Powerpole contact will accept is the primary limitation of their ability to carry a load. Powerpole connectors will safely handle higher loads or surges, please read the linked data sheets (PDF) for additional information.The contacts are made of highly conductive silver-plated copper for minimal contact resistance at high currents. The average contact resistance is 500 micro-ohms.Flat wiping contact system This system allows for minimal contact resistance at high current. The self-wiping action cleans contact surfaces during connection/disconnection. The contacts are rated at 10,000 no-load connect/disconnect cycles. When two pairs are mated together, it takes approximately 15 pounds of tension to pull them apart.Stainless steel spring Good connectors should not loose contact tension under use or vibration. Powerpole connectors use a stainless steel spring which applies 50 lbs. of pressure to hold the silver-plated copper contacts firmly together and maintain constant contact. This is ideal for frequent connect/disconnect cycles. Other cheaper connectors simply depend upon soft copper that eventually spreads apart and becomes loose.Durable polycarbonate housing The Powerpole insulated housings use a durable, high impact-resistant, high temperature polycarbonate plastic with a UL94 V-0 flammability rating. The connector design allows air to flow through the housing, assisting in cooling.Additional accessories include handles, boots and dust covers A variety of Powerpole accessories are available including weather resistant dust caps, corrosion proof safety boots, connector handle kits, strain relief cable clamps and more.Powerpole® and SB® are registered trademarks of Anderson Power Products, Inc.Related ProductsQuick View SB50 Environmental Boot with Cover, Source Side$10.99SKU: 3-6055P2   Quick View Powerwerx Handheld Hex Crimper for Large SB Series and Powerpole Connectors1$89.99SKU: SBcrimp   Quick View SB50 SB Series Connector Red Handle Kit with HardwareAs Low As $3.99SKU: SB50HDLRed   Customers who purchased this item also purchasedQuick View Dust Cover for SB50 SB Series 50 Amp Housings1$3.49SKU: DUST-SB50   Quick View Corrosion Proof Safety Boot for SB50 Amp HousingsAs Low As $3.29SKU: Boot-SB50   Quick View SB50 SB Series Connector Red Handle Kit with HardwareAs Low As $3.99SKU: SB50HDLRed   Quick View Powerwerx Economy Crimping Tool for 75 amp Powerpole and SB50 SB Series Connectors$16.99SKU: CT-75   Downloads  SB Series SB50 Data Sheet  (890KB)     5900 6 AWG Contact Drawing  (61KB)    5915 10 AWG Contact Drawing  (75KB)    5952 8 AWG Contact Drawing  (57KB)    SB Series SB50 Housing Drawing  (123KB)  Customer ReviewsPower pole and Odyssey battery  By  Jim  I've been using these connectors for many years with my odyssey batteries. They are perfect for emergency use and can carry the high output of the battery. If you are soldering the connector, use a soldering gun for the best results. I have also used the SB - 50 in a vacuum chamber and the design of the connector prevented arc over in the low pressure. This made setup of experiments very convenient.Was this review helpful?  Yes No   (4/0)  Use a crimper  By  Bill Dornbush  The info sheet indicated you could use either soldering or crimping. I tried to solder but gave up while waiting for my #10 wire and large connector to heat enough. I got a non-insulated crimper and that worked fine.  Once I got the wires crimped to the connector, all worked as I expected.Was this review helpful?  Yes No   (7/0)  be careful with colors  By  bill bourn  The smaller connectors all mate with each other allowing creativity in coding your circuits and identifying which cables connect to each other. From the SB50 specification PDF: Mechanical keys ensure connectors will only mate with connectors of the same color. Different color housings are selected to identify voltages, thus preventing mismatching of the power supply system.Was this review helpful?
