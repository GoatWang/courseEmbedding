Reproductive endocrinologist and gynecologist Ellen Wilson, M.D., offers the most advanced therapies for a range of complex gynecological conditions for women of all ages. She is one of very few subspecialists who cares for children and adolescents as well as adults.
Dr. Wilson sees adult patients at the Fertility and Advanced Reproductive Medicine Clinic, where she treats a range of complex gynecologic disorders, and she sees pediatric and adolescent gynecology patients at Children’s Health Specialty Center Dallas Campus and Children’s Plano/Legacy.
She serves as Division Director of the Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology Program at Children’s Health in Dallas.
Dr. Wilson specializes in treating advanced reproductive disorders that include endometriosis <link to Q&A>, polycystic ovary syndrome, uterine fibroid tumors, ovarian cysts, congenital anomalies of the female reproductive tract – including müllerian duct anomalies – and various hormonal disorders such as premature ovarian failure from chemotherapy or other causes.
Minimally Invasive Surgery Expert
Dr. Wilson is fellowship-trained in the use of minimally invasive surgery and experienced in robotic surgical techniques for performing procedures such as hysterectomy, myomectomy, tubal ligation reversal, and operations to correct reproductive abnormalities present at birth.
“Tools like the da Vinci robot use very precise instrumentation and give us a 3-D look at what’s going on,” Dr. Wilson says. “Not only do these state-of-the-art procedures help us minimize additional surgeries, they enable patients to recover much more quickly than with traditional open surgeries.”
She has been named a Texas Monthly Super Doctor every year since 2005. She also is a two-time D Magazine Best Doctor.
In addition to her clinical work, she enjoys the educational aspect of her position at UT Southwestern.
“I love teaching,” she says. “I get a lot of satisfaction from using my experience to train the next generation of physicians to do what I do and to like it as much as I do.”
