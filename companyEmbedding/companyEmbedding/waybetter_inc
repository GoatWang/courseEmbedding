Contact Us
Waybetter Marketing is an innovative, data-driven enrollment marketing company.We have one mission: help colleges and universities enroll more students. We’ve done it at institutions of all shapes and sizes all over the country.  




















































Clients











Our track record speaks for itself. 



In the last seven years, Waybetter clients increased their number of deposits by an average of 12%. Recently, we helped: 








Merrimack College grow from 2,000 students to 2,500 students. Read more.












Juniata College increase their average class size of 385 to 446. Read more.












Albion College increase their number of deposited students by 28%. Read more.





Case Studies











We’re successful because we believe: 



























Yet most colleges and universities take a decidedly impersonal approach in their marketing efforts. They send the same recruiting materials to all prospective students—whether they’re from around the corner or around the world, whether they want to study astrophysics or accounting. At Waybetter, we know there’s a better way. A way to make your attempts at connecting more personal and more successful.

Our Method











We don't want to rebrand you or sell you expensive software. 



We just want to take a task that seems overwhelming to you and make it easy. And we’ll do it using the marketing materials already at your disposal. This keeps your per student costs down while guaranteeing you stay true to who you are. We're committed to this kind of authenticity because it feels good, because it's faster, and because it gets the best results. It’s the Waybetter way.If you'd like to talk a little more about our approach to enrollment marketing, please let us know.

WayBetter - Motivating Healthy Behaviors




















About Us

  We make games that motivate people to achieve their goals.
  
  Imagine a game that makes it fun to lose weight, to exercise more, 
  to quit smoking. Could a game change your life? Yes!
  
  We call all our games bets because we use money to hold you accountable. 
  But it’s not about betting. Our games are about believing in yourself, 
  investing in your health, and sticking to your commitments.
  
  Our approach works. In our first game, 
  DietBet, 
  players have lost 5 million pounds and we’ve paid out over $21 million to winners. 
  Dietbetting is now a worldwide movement with over 400,000 players in 90 countries.
  
  Stay tuned for new life-changing games like StepBet, CigaBet, and CardioBet.

The Team




Jamie Rosen
Founder & CEO
Jamie started WayBetter after seeing friends compete in an office weight-loss contest. People who rarely exercised were suddenly jogging at lunch, spontaneously doing push-ups, leaving chocolates on each other's desks, and laughing a lot. It was like someone had spiked the water. Jamie decided to recreate that healthy energy on a large scale, using social media to let people motivate each other to get in shape, without it ever feeling like work.
Jamie is passionate about the Fun Theory, which contends that fun can change human behavior for the better. After graduating from Harvard, he developed toys with Jerry Lemelson, an inventor with almost as many patents as Thomas Edison. He later dropped out of HBS to start a company that made surfing the web whimsical. He patented some inventions relating to location-based games which he sold to Yahoo, co-wrote a book about unusual careers, and developed a stress-reliever called The ScreenSmasher.
He is happily married with three young kids who are experts in Fun Theory.

About Us - Way Better Snacks











































































About Us 
I had a vision to create better food: delicious snacks I could feel good about eating and feeding to my friends and family.
Begin with better, end with way better: 
I knew that beginning with the highest quality ingredients meant we’d end up with better snacks. Our beans, grains and seeds are expertly sourced for texture, color, and most importantly: way better flavor. The quality comes through each and every snack. You can actually see the deliciousness! 
But starting with the highest quality ingredients isn’t the only secret to our snacks; it’s what we do with those excellent ingredients that matters most. Our remarkable sprouting process isn’t easy, but it’s the secret to our amazing snacks. Sprouting makes powerhouse ingredients like quinoa, black beans, and chia seeds even better by unlocking all the awesomeness inside for your body to use.
That is how Way Better Snacks was born.  We always use the highest quality ingredients to craft our delicious snacks. We always make sure our products are made with all natural non-GMO ingredients, and we never add anything artificial whatsoever.  We sprout these great seeds, beans and grains to make them even better.
That’s why Way Better Snacks are made better. They’re crafted to be addictively delicious and better for you. But, don’t take my word for it. Pop open a bag and enjoy a snack… or 5! Let’s eat!
– Jim Breen, Founder and CEO of Way Better Snacks
