    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

A Stericycle truck


Stericycle is a compliance company that specializes in collecting and disposing regulated substances, such as medical waste and sharps, pharmaceuticals, hazardous waste, and providing services for recalled and expired goods. It also provides related education and training services, and patient communication services. The company was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, with many more bases of operation around the world, including toxic waste incinerators in Utah and North Carolina.
Stericycle has been harshly criticized by residents living near their incinerators and environmentalists across the globe.[3] Currently, Stericycle is being investigated by the state of Utah for burning hazardous, radioactive[4] waste above legal levels at their North Salt Lake location. The investigations also are in response to Stericycle's falsification of records to hide the illegal quantity burning near Foxboro Elementary in North Salt Lake.[5][6][7]
Stericycle, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, offers regulated waste management services, sharps disposal containers to reduce the risk of needlesticks, healthcare compliance services, pharmaceutical disposal, and regulated returns management services for expired or recalled products through incineration processes.
The company serves healthcare facilities such as hospitals, blood banks, pharmaceutical manufacturers,. Stericycle also serves myriad small businesses, which include outpatient clinics, medical and dental offices, abortion clinics, veterinary and animal hospitals, funeral homes, home healthcare agencies, body art studios, and long-term and sub-acute care facilities. Medical device manufacturers, consumer goods manufacturers, and retailers are also key customers.

Stericycle was founded in 1989 as a regulated medical waste company. It became a publicly traded company in 1996. In the late 80's Troy had a vision. He saw a need in the industry and jumped on it.
In 1999, Stericycle began offering safety and compliance training services with the launch of its Stericycle Steri-Safe OSHA Compliance program.
Stericycle's hospital offerings grew in 2003 when it acquired Bio Systems. Today, Stericycle Sharps Management Service with Bio Systems containers is the US leader in reusable sharps container management service.[citation needed]
The company’s pharmaceutical waste programs provide disposal of unused or expired wastes in hospitals, healthcare practices, and pharmacies.
To help hospitals manage their waste streams and drive recycling efforts, Stericycle began to offer Stericycle Integrated Waste Stream Solutions in 2009.
In 2010, Stericycle expanded its service offering again to include patient notification services with the acquisition of NotifyMD. Several other acquisitions followed, giving Stericycle a leadership position[citation needed] in telephone support services for physician offices. Serving customers across the United States, the NotifyMD team provides a breadth of services designed to improve office productivity and communication with patients.
In 2014, Stericycle acquired PSC Environmental Services LLC in a deal worth $275 million to form Stericycle Environmental Solutions.[8] This acquisition further reinforced Stericycle's position in the waste management industry, with specific expansion in hazardous waste management.
In 2015, Stericycle acquired Shred-it International in a deal worth $2.3 billion.[9]
International[edit]
The company’s international business began in 1997 with a joint venture in Mexico.
Since then, Stericycle has created services, tools and resources for healthcare professionals not only in the United States and Mexico, but also in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Japan, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
Beyond services related to healthcare wastes, in some markets the company has expanded its offerings to include management of certain hazardous wastes as well as patient transport and medical courier services.
Controversy[edit]
Stericycle's medical waste incinerator located in North Salt Lake, Utah has been a topic of hot debate in the community. In September 2013, Erin Brockovich joined in with Utah residents in their call for Stericycle to discontinue their business in the area.[10][11] Brockovich's visit was spurred by a violation notice from the Utah Division of Air Quality to Stericycle for excessive emissions above legal limits, and manipulating their reporting to show lower amounts of Mercury, Dioxins, and other potentially harmful chemicals emitted through burning medical waste.[12][13]
The violations in 2013 were followed by criminal investigations at the order of Utah Governor Gary Herbert.[5][6] Investigations by California's Soil Water Air Protection Enterprise, or SWAPE, in connection with Ms. Brockovich, discovered Dioxin in homes near the incinerator at levels 16x higher than what is considered "safe".[14][15]
As of December 1, 2014, Stericycle and the Utah Division of Air Quality reached an agreement acknowledging no wrongdoing, though the settlement does require Stericycle to relocate approximately 40 miles to the west of the incinerator's current location in North Salt Lake. The settlement also calls for Stericycle to pay a $2.3 million fine, half of which is forgivable if the move happens within 3 years.[16][17]

A Stericycle truck


Stericycle is a compliance company that specializes in collecting and disposing regulated substances, such as medical waste and sharps, pharmaceuticals, hazardous waste, and providing services for recalled and expired goods. It also provides related education and training services, and patient communication services. The company was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, with many more bases of operation around the world, including toxic waste incinerators in Utah and North Carolina.
Stericycle has been harshly criticized by residents living near their incinerators and environmentalists across the globe.[3] Currently, Stericycle is being investigated by the state of Utah for burning hazardous, radioactive[4] waste above legal levels at their North Salt Lake location. The investigations also are in response to Stericycle's falsification of records to hide the illegal quantity burning near Foxboro Elementary in North Salt Lake.[5][6][7]
Stericycle, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, offers regulated waste management services, sharps disposal containers to reduce the risk of needlesticks, healthcare compliance services, pharmaceutical disposal, and regulated returns management services for expired or recalled products through incineration processes.
The company serves healthcare facilities such as hospitals, blood banks, pharmaceutical manufacturers,. Stericycle also serves myriad small businesses, which include outpatient clinics, medical and dental offices, abortion clinics, veterinary and animal hospitals, funeral homes, home healthcare agencies, body art studios, and long-term and sub-acute care facilities. Medical device manufacturers, consumer goods manufacturers, and retailers are also key customers.

Stericycle Protects What Matters
From medical waste and document destruction to sustainability services and compliance solutions, the Stericycle team has been serving customers since 1989.











A Team of Purpose Driven Individuals
Since our founding over 25 years ago, Stericycle has grown from a small start-up in medical waste management into a leader across a range of increasingly complex and highly regulated arenas, including compliance and sustainability waste services, brand protection solutions, and customer contact solutions.
Every organization today must comply with increasingly strict regulatory guidelines and quality controls in the delivery of their core businesses. Large or small, businesses can’t always do it on their own. They seek out Stericycle to help them. We have the expertise and passion to take on many complicated and often behind-the-scenes services our clients don’t always know how to do well but ultimately make their businesses better.

Stericycle is a team of talented and purpose driven individuals.

Innovating From the Start
In the late 1980s, illegally disposed medical waste begins washing ashore of the Atlantic Coast. Shortly thereafter the U.S. Congress passes the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 and the U.S. medical waste industry is born.
About the same time, Dr. James Sharp develops a business plan that focuses on helping hospitals manage their medical waste in an environmentally sound and cost effective manner; this leads to the formation of Stericycle in 1989.

Increase Safety & Regulatory Compliance
Sharps management minimizes staff exposure to sharps injuries, from the site of patient care through proper disposal — a critical directive to ensure a safe healthcare environment for all employees.
Our sharps reusable containers reduce the risk of injuries during disposal through the use of a vertical drop lid, requiring no manual intervention by staff. 98% of customers surveyed have reduced needlestick injuries from disposal within 1 year of implementing our program.1
 

Control Your Costs
As the impact of healthcare reforms continues to unfold and regulatory oversight increases, hospitals need cost-effective solutions that also decrease the impact of waste on the environment. SMS provides a program to meet these demands by reducing the risk of needlestick injuries and reducing red bag waste. This allows you to concentrate on your core mission — providing patient care.
 

Peace of Mind
Stericycle’s reusable containers have undergone rigorous testing, exceed the American Society for Testing and Materials(ASTM) puncture standard, and are 510k approved. After the full sharps containers are transported to our processing facility, lids are removed robotically with state-of-the-art automated equipment, and the containers are appropriately disinfected before reuse. Stericycle exceeds the FDA requirements of disinfection. All containers are quality assurance inspected after cleaning.
Stericycle’s nationwide coverage and redundancies in staff, equipment and processing facilities ensures uninterrupted service. This gives you of peace of mind that in the event of an emergency Stericycle still has you covered.
 

Minimize Your Environmental Impact
To reduce environmental impact, the use of Stericycle’s reusable sharps containers significantly decreases the amount of treated medical waste sent to landfills by as much as 30%. One reusable container keeps 600 disposable sharps containers from reaching landfills. Reusing containers eliminates the need to manufacture new containers and helps conserve natural resources. What would your carbon footprint be with Stericycle’s reusable sharps containers?

Increase Safety & Regulatory Compliance
Sharps management minimizes staff exposure to sharps injuries, from the site of patient care through proper disposal — a critical directive to ensure a safe healthcare environment for all employees.
Our sharps reusable containers reduce the risk of injuries during disposal through the use of a vertical drop lid, requiring no manual intervention by staff. 98% of customers surveyed have reduced needlestick injuries from disposal within 1 year of implementing our program.1
 

Control Your Costs
As the impact of healthcare reforms continues to unfold and regulatory oversight increases, hospitals need cost-effective solutions that also decrease the impact of waste on the environment. SMS provides a program to meet these demands by reducing the risk of needlestick injuries and reducing red bag waste. This allows you to concentrate on your core mission — providing patient care.
 

Peace of Mind
Stericycle’s reusable containers have undergone rigorous testing, exceed the American Society for Testing and Materials(ASTM) puncture standard, and are 510k approved. After the full sharps containers are transported to our processing facility, lids are removed robotically with state-of-the-art automated equipment, and the containers are appropriately disinfected before reuse. Stericycle exceeds the FDA requirements of disinfection. All containers are quality assurance inspected after cleaning.
Stericycle’s nationwide coverage and redundancies in staff, equipment and processing facilities ensures uninterrupted service. This gives you of peace of mind that in the event of an emergency Stericycle still has you covered.
 

Minimize Your Environmental Impact
To reduce environmental impact, the use of Stericycle’s reusable sharps containers significantly decreases the amount of treated medical waste sent to landfills by as much as 30%. One reusable container keeps 600 disposable sharps containers from reaching landfills. Reusing containers eliminates the need to manufacture new containers and helps conserve natural resources. What would your carbon footprint be with Stericycle’s reusable sharps containers?
