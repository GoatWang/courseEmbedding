Successful Turnaround Continues to Elevate Bank to Record Performance

STAMFORD, Conn., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. ("Patriot" or the "Bancorp") (NASDAQ:PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the "Bank"), today announced its intention to begin making quarterly dividends for shareholders of the community bank's stock, another sign of its continuing strong performance.  With this announcement, Patriot has declared its first quarterly dividend of $.01 per share.  The record date for this quarterly dividend will be July 24, 2017, with a dividend payment date of August 1, 2017.  This is the first time since the financial crisis that the Bank has declared a dividend.
Patriot has recorded multiple strong fiscal quarters and proven earnings stability under the leadership of its Chairman, Michael Carrazza, who assumed the role of interim CEO in August 2016.  In October 2016, the Bank strengthened and diversified its executive leadership team and in February 2017 promoted Richard Muskus Jr. from within to serve as its President. 
At the end of the 2016 fiscal year, Patriot surpassed the three quarters of a billion-dollar milestone, with strong growth continuing into 2017.  In the first fiscal quarter of 2017, Patriot reported net income of $1,730,000, or $0.44 per diluted share, a 165% increase over the prior year.  First quarter earnings also increased 66% over the prior quarter.  
CEO Michael Carrazza stated: "Patriot's improving performance is a direct result of ongoing operational efficiencies, product diversification and asset growth.  These changes continue to yield a positive impact, which now serve as a catalyst to reactivate the Bank's dividend policy for the first time since 2008."  Patriot has 3,894,128 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2017.
The head of private investment firm Solaia Capital Advisors, Mr. Carrazza designed and led the recapitalization transaction to rescue and turnaround Patriot, which became deeply troubled during the financial crisis. "Patriot has never been as strong and healthy as it is today.  With continued steady growth and new achievements, we plan to continue declaring quarterly dividends to our shareholders," he added.
As of March 31, 2017, total Bank assets increased to $775 million, as compared to $636 million at March 31, 2016.  Net loans totaled $625 million, up 30% over $480 million at March 31, 2016.   Deposits grew to $561 million at March 31, 2017 as compared to $424 million at March 31 2016.  Patriot has seen total deposits grow an aggregate of 32% over the last year.  The Bank's capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its "well capitalized" regulatory status. 
About the Patriot National Bancorp, Inc.
Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut and the Bank has full service branches in Connecticut and New York.
Since opening its doors in 1994, Patriot's mission has been to serve our local communities by helping our neighbors and neighborhood businesses thrive. All lending is handled locally and is specific to each borrower, and the commitment to local businesses goes further to connect, support and grow businesses in both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors, along with municipalities. Patriot believes a well-connected community is a strong community—and that together, all will prosper.
"Safe Harbor" Statement Under Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
Certain statements contained in Bancorp's public statements, including this one, may be forward looking and subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These factors include, but are not limited to, (1) changes in prevailing interest rates which would affect the interest earned on Bancorp's interest earning assets and the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities, (2) the timing of repricing of Bancorp's interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, (3) the effect of changes in governmental monetary policy, (4) the components of Bancorp's periodic earnings and assets, (5) the fact that certain of the income recognized by Bancorp in any quarter may not be repeated in future periods, (6) the effect of changes in regulations applicable to Bancorp and the Bank and the conduct of its business, (7) changes in competition among financial service companies, including possible further encroachment of non-banks on services traditionally provided by banks, (8) the ability of competitors that are larger than Bancorp to provide products and services which it is impracticable for Bancorp to provide, (9) the state of the economy and real estate values in Bancorp's market areas, and the consequent effect on the quality of Bancorp's loans, (10) recent governmental initiatives that are expected to have a profound effect on the financial services industry and could dramatically change the competitive environment of Patriot, (11) other legislative or regulatory changes, including those related to residential mortgages, changes in accounting standards, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") premiums that may adversely affect Patriot, (12) the application of generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,  (13) the fact that one period of reported results may not be indicative of future periods,  (14)  the state of the economy in the greater New York metropolitan area and its particular effect on Patriot's customers, vendors and communities and other such factors, including risk factors, as may be described in Bancorp's other filings with the SEC.

(NYSE: PN), following which we have published a free report that can be viewed by signing up at http://protraderdaily.com/optin/?symbol=PN. The Company announced on July 13, 2017, that its Board of Directors has accepted the resignation of Founder and the CEO of the Company, Steven M. Mariano. Patriot National also announced John Rearer as the new Chief Executive Officer, where he most recently headed the Patriot Underwriters, Inc., Mariano originally founded the Company in 2003 and was also the Company's majority shareholder, according to the SEC filings. For immediate access to our complimentary reports, including today's coverage, register for free now at:

At Pro-TD, we make it our mission to bring you news that matter about the stock you follow. Today, our research desk covers a blog story on PN. Go directly to your stock of interest and access today's free coverage at:
http://protraderdaily.com/optin/?symbol=PN 
The Announcement
 
Mariano offered his resignation on July 10, 2017, post which on July 12, 2017, the Board executed a separation agreement with Mariano. Mariano will continue to serve in a consulting role, where he will help Patriot National, as reasonably requested by the Board of Directors or the CEO, and be available upon request to the Special Committee of independent directors to explore and review multiple strategic alternatives for the Company.
 
John Rearer, the new CEO, is an insurance executive with over 25 years of experience. Rearer joined Patriot Underwriters, Inc., in 2005 as the Vice President, and most recently held the post of the CEO at the Company. Also, prior to joining Patriot National, Rearer was the VP of Preferred Employers Group, a managing general agency based in Miami. Patriot National, the Fort Lauderdale-based Company, delivers technology and outsourcing products to insurance Companies across the nation.
 
The Mariano-Stockholder Conflict
 
Patriot National saw a bearish stroke in May 2016, when the Company disclosed that it had signed an agreement with a Company, that was majority owned by Marian, namely, Guarantee Insurance Corp. The particular agreement with Guarantee Insurance allowed for a $30 million capital injection into Patriot National in exchange for raising the deadline of its contract by at least 10 years. Guarantee Insurance was one of the Company's biggest customers, accounting for $107.8 million, or 59% of the Company's fee income in the first three months of 2016.
 
The Special Dividend Case
 
The Company also observed turmoil when Mariano proposed a special dividend in 2016, where Mariano, holds about 36.4 % shares outstanding, was set to receive a special dividend pay off. The proposal was challenged by shareholders in court. The Company has been viewing strategic alternatives, where on May 30, 2016, it announced the Board of Directors has formed a new special committee for the exploration of strategic alternatives.
 
No Q1 FY16 Results
 
Patriot National has not filed its quarterly filing release from Q1 FY17 filing or its 2016 annual report with the SEC. Also, the Company has been the subject of different class actions in March 2016 from its shareholders. With respect to the Company's bearish trend, Mariano's resignation may act as a positive catalyst for Patriot National which has observed its stock prices decline over the past two years.
 
Last Close Stock Review
 
At the close of trading session on Friday, July 14, 2017, Patriot National's stock price jumped 11.76% to end the day at $2.09. A total volume of 387.01 thousand shares were exchanged during the session, which was above the 3-month average volume of 107.70 thousand shares. At Friday's closing price, the stock's net capitalization stands at $50.20 million.

Equity Bancshares, Inc. Expands Into Oklahoma, Announces Two Merger Agreements  With Eastman National Bank and Patriot Bank
 


July 17, 2017 -- 







WICHITA, Kan., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQBK) (?Equity or the ?Company), parent company of Equity Bank, announced today it has entered into two definitive merger agreements with Oklahoma-based banks. Equity entered into definitive merger agreements with Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. (?Eastman), the parent of The Eastman National Bank of Newkirk, Oklahoma, and Cache Holdings, Inc. (?Patriot), the parent company of Patriot Bank of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Equity intends to close the mergers simultaneously during the fourth quarter of 2017. After the mergers conclude, Equity will have completed 13 successful integrations in its first 15 years, and five mergers since the Companys initial public offering on November 11, 2015. These newest mergers add a fourth state  Oklahoma  to Equitys Midwestern footprint, and each is within close proximity to Equitys corporate office in Wichita. Eastmans headquarters is 55 miles from Wichita, and 10 miles from the Kansas and Oklahoma border. Tulsa is 170 miles from Wichita. ?Each time we partner with a strong, local community bank, were fortunate to work alongside a group of bankers who match up with our philosophy of strong credit culture, significant community involvement, and commitment to our customers. Eastman and Patriot are no exception. Were pleased to welcome employees and leadership with similar values to ours, said Brad Elliott, Chairman and CEO of Equity. ?We believe these mergers continue our model of adding markets that help build our footprint, like Ponca City and Newkirk, complemented by metropolitan areas of Kansas City, Wichita, and now Tulsa. Were proud to offer sophisticated, innovative financial products and services coupled with the customization and local decision-making customers expect from a community bank. Equity reported $2.40 billion in consolidated total assets, net loans of $1.51 billion, and deposits of $1.82 billion as of March 31, 2017. Equity operates 37 Equity Bank branch offices in Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri. After consummation of the transactions, which are expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Equity expects to be approximately $3.01 billion in consolidated total assets, including 42 branch offices across the four-state footprint of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The combined institution is expected to have $2.08 billion in loans and $2.29 billion in deposits. Eastman National Bank and Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. Eastman principally conducts banking business through four full-service branch locations in Kay County, Oklahoma, including branches in Ponca City, Oklahoma and the original Eastman branch in Newkirk, Oklahoma, which was established in 1893 as The Eastman National Bank of Newkirk. ?Were pleased to announce our next chapter and continued, dedicated service to the Ponca City and Newkirk communities. Were particularly pleased to work with Equity Bank to deliver straightforward financial solutions with the local decision-making that our customers have trusted for more than 100 years, said Mark Detten, President and CEO of Eastman. ?Our customers and communities will benefit from additional products, services and solutions of a strong bank with a regional network committed to Kay County and our community bank customers, added Mr. Detten. As of March 31, 2017, Eastman had $254.0 million in total assets, $181.5 million in loans and $217.6 million in deposits. Eastman ranks No. 2 in FDIC deposit market share in Kay County, Oklahoma, with share of 24.31% as of June 30, 2016, according to FDIC data published by SNL Financial. Eastmans local leadership will continue to serve Kay County as part of Equity, including Mr. Detten, Senior Vice President Darin Kirchenbauer and Senior Vice President Erin Liberton. At closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Eastman will merge with and into Equity, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including Eastman shareholder approval. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, approved by the boards of directors of Equity and Eastman, at the effective time of the merger the shareholders of Eastman will have the right to receive an aggregate consideration of approximately $242.72 per share. Equity will acquire all outstanding shares of Eastman common stock. The definitive agreement provides that each outstanding share of Eastman common stock will represent the right to receive a fixed exchange ratio of 6.1389 shares of Equity Class A common stock and $48.91 in cash. Based on Equitys closing stock price on July 14, 2017 of $31.57 per share, the aggregate transaction value is approximately $46.6 million. The actual aggregate transaction value may be subject to equity adjustments prior to closing, as further set forth in the definitive merger agreement. Equity expects the merger to be approximately $0.20 accretive to diluted earnings per share in 2018, and $0.21 accretive to earnings per share in 2019, with transaction-related and one-time costs of approximately $4.6 million. Equity expects the merger to be approximately 3.2% dilutive to tangible book value per share at closing, inclusive of the estimated purchase accounting adjustments, and expects the tangible book value earnback to be 2.8 years. Finally, Equity expects to remain above all ?Well Capitalized capital ratios as defined by regulatory guidelines, inclusive of the impact of all estimated purchase accounting adjustments. Patriot Bank and Cache Holdings, Inc. Patriot Bank of Tulsa, Oklahoma was established in 1995 and focused on commercial loans and treasury services to the Tulsa community. Tulsa is the second-largest metropolitan statistical area in Oklahoma, with a diverse economy that includes wholesale and retail trade, professional and business services, government and health services as its largest segments. ?Were pleased to partner with a bank that shares many of our core principles and values, and provides honest, straightforward service to our business clients, said Mike Bezanson, Chairman and CEO of Patriot. ?Since founding Patriot Bank, weve worked tirelessly to meet the financial needs of our commercial and consumer clients. Were pleased to add the products, services, and entrepreneurial spirit of a bank that will help our local loan officers and professionals offer quick, local decisions, and is committed to Tulsa. As of March 31, 2017, Patriot had total assets of $320.0 million, loans of $287.7 million, and $271.6 million in deposits. Patriot ranks No. 20 in FDIC deposit market share out of 291 institutions in the Tulsa metropolitan statistical area, with a market share of 1.01% as of June 30, 2016, according to FDIC data published by SNL Financial. At closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Patriots parent company will merge with and into Equity, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including the approval of Patriot shareholders. Patriots long-tenured management team of Mr. Bezanson, Jay Morey, and Philip Houchin will continue to serve Equitys Tulsa market.

Based on Equitys closing stock price on July 14, 2017 of $31.57 per share, the aggregate transaction value is approximately $50.5 million. The actual aggregate transaction value may be subject to equity adjustments prior to closing, as further set forth in the definitive merger agreement. Equity expects the merger to be approximately $0.15 accretive to diluted earnings per share in 2018 and $0.16 accretive in 2019, with transaction-related and one-time costs of approximately $2.7 million. Equity expects the merger to be approximately 2.1% dilutive to tangible book value per share at closing, inclusive of the estimated purchase accounting adjustments, and expects the tangible book value earnback to be approximately 2.8 years.

Special Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements  This press release contains ?forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.� These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Equitys management with respect to, among other things, future events and Equitys financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as ?may, ?should, ?could, ?predict, ?potential, ?believe, ?will likely result, ?expect, ?continue, ?will, ?anticipate, ?seek, ?estimate, ?intend, ?plan, ?project, ?forecast, ?goal, ?target, ?would and ?outlook, or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature.� These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equitys industry, managements beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equitys control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.� Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equitys expectations include competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, and similar variables. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to ?Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and ?Risk Factors in Equitys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2017 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equitys subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Equitys underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Equity anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Equity does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, Equity cannot assess the impact of each factor on Equitys business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that Equity or persons acting on Equitys behalf may issue. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.57      Net Money Flow ($)  -11,484    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
