DisclaimerThe past performance results presented herein do not guarantee and are not indicative of future results. There can be no assurance that these or comparable returns will be achieved from investments made by the Courage Special Situations Master Fund, L.P. (“Master Fund”), either individually or in the aggregate. All returns shown have been calculated on a consistent basis and assume a theoretical continuous investment in Class A interests of the Master Fund’s domestic feeder fund through March 31, 2010, which are charged a 1% annual management fee and 20% annual incentive allocation, and Class B interests of the Master Fund’s domestic feeder from and after April 1, 2010, which are charged a 1.25% annual management fee and 20% annual incentive allocation. All returns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and interest and the deduction of all fees, expenses and incentive allocation. Beginning March 2008, all returns presented reflect returns for a ‘‘new issue eligible’’ investor. Allocation of new issues to new issue eligible investors may result in returns to such investors that are higher than the returns to “new issue ineligible” investors. Investors should be aware that, when the Funds have been able to achieve positive returns, it has done so partially due to various hedging strategies, such as the “short” selling of securities and the selling and buying of options of underlying securities and commodities and futures contracts. The performance data listed above for the domestic feeder fund was developed internally by the fund itself and such performance numbers are unaudited. It is possible that performance goals of the fund may not be achieved and that an investor could lose all or a significant portion of its investment. Portfolio position data reflects holdings of the Master Fund.



DisclaimerThe past performance results presented herein do not guarantee and are not indicative of future results.

All returns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and interest and the deduction of all fees, expenses and incentive allocation. The performance data listed above was developed internally by the fund itself and such performance numbers are unaudited. It is possible that performance goals of the fund may not be achieved and that an investor could lose all or a significant portion of its investment.



DisclaimerThe past performance results presented herein do not guarantee and are not indicative of future results. There can be no assurance that these or comparable returns will be achieved from investments made by the Courage Long Short Opportunity Fund, L.P.
