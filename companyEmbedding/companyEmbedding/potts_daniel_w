Derek Potts
National Managing Partner
Paralegal: Genae Leal
 


As founder and Managing Partner of The Potts Law Firm, Derek Potts focuses his casework on complex litigation and trials, including mass torts, pharmaceutical matters, and medical device cases. He has become a respected name among the legal community, serving in various national litigation leadership roles, speaking at numerous seminars throughout the country, and obtaining landmark jury verdicts and settlements for his clients.
His impressive list of awards and honors includes recognition among the Top 100 Trial Lawyers by The National Trial Lawyers, being selected as one of the Best Lawyers in America and being named Best of the Bar by the Kansas City Business Journal and American Lawyer Media, and Martindale-Hubbell granted him the title of Top Rated Lawyer in Mass Torts in 2013.
Among his many professional associations, Mr. Potts is a member of the American Association for Justice, where he served on the Board of Governor for New Lawyers for three years. He has also served on the Board of Governors for the Missouri Association of Trial Attorneys and the Kansas Association for Justice. He is also a member of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association.
Mr. Potts attended William Jewell College, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts in History. His scholarship earned him admittance into Phi Alpha Delta, the largest co-ed professional law fraternity in the country. He was also named a member of Mortar Board, a national honor society recognizing outstanding students. After college, he pursued his Juris Doctor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, where he made the Dean’s List, participated as a member of the National Appellate Advocacy Team, and received the Judge Conrad B. Duberstein Appellate Advocacy Award.
After serving as a Prosecutor Intern in the Wyandotte County, Kansas District Attorney’s Office for a year, Mr. Potts joined Brown and James, P.C. and worked for that large defense firm and one other firm for over six years before founding his own practice, where he has earned a reputation as one of the top mass tort lawyers in the country.
Among the many cases he has been a part of, Mr. Potts has served in leadership positions for multiple national litigations, including acting as Liaison and Co-Lead Counsel in In Re Mentor Corp. Obtape Transobturator Sling Products Liability Litigation, MDL Case No. 2004 and leading the bellwether trial team in In Re Kugel Mesh Hernia Patch Products Liability Litigation, MDL Case No. 1842 where he was also a member of the Plaintiffs’ Steering committee.

He was appointed Plaintiffs’ Liaison Counsel in California's Judicial Council Coordinated Proceedings for all Xarelto cases. He is also Plaintiffs’ co-lead counsel in the CR Bard and Neomedic MDLs.
In addition to his work at The Potts Law Firm, he has provided pro bono representation as part of the Jackson County Bar Association Volunteer Attorney Project. In this capacity, he has donated his time and experience to represent indigent clients, children, the elderly, and other individuals who may not be able to afford legal counsel in Kansas City.
He is licensed in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, New York, and Texas, as well as the U.S. District Courts for the District of Kansas, Eastern District of Missouri, Western District of Missouri, Eastern District of Arkansas, Western District of Arkansas, Southern District of New York, Southern District of Texas, Western District of Texas, and the District of West Virginia, and the Middle District of Georgia.

Adam T. Funk
Senior Associate - Houston and New Mexico

Adam T. Funk wants to represent you. Get to know Adam and see why.
Adam is educated to help you.


Adam T. Funk graduated from the University of Texas in Austin with a degree in Business Administration. After graduating college in only three years with honors, Adam worked for an Austin law firm specializing in personal injury and product liability. The work experience in Austin helped Adam understand his true calling in life – helping those in need through this nation’s great civil justice system. Soon thereafter, Adam enrolled at the University of Houston Law Center. While in law school, Adam was a member of the Mock Trial Team and the Moot Court Team and competed in numerous tournaments across the nation. On several occasions, Adam was awarded Best Speaker in the tournament. In addition, Adam was also awarded the Order of the Barristers by the Law School – a rarely-given honor bestowed upon students who have excelled in trial advocacy.
Adam is passionate about helping you.


Adam has always been a trial lawyer.  Soon after graduating from Law School, Adam immediately went to work at a prestigious firm representing the injured.  Adam represented those injured by negligent drivers, by medical professionals, and by huge pharmaceutical corporations.  Adam obtained favorable outcomes in trial verdicts and settlements and in his first few years out of law school.  His experience led him to be named a Rising Star by Texas Monthly Magazine after only three years practicing law.

In 2011, Adam expanded his client base to include Texas and New Mexico.  He became an expert in the laws of both states.  He spent half his time in Texas and the other half in New Mexico.  Throughout his legal career, Adam has only represented those who were personally injured.
Adam is experienced to help you.


Adam has represented thousands of clients who have been injured.  Whether he tried their case to a jury or reached a settlement, each client was met with respect, transparency, and honesty.  Due to confidential settlement provisions, attorney-client privileges, and Rules of Professional Conduct, Adam cannot specifically list his successes, but refers you to his numerous positive client reviews on various websites.

Adam has practiced in 27 different states, 24 federal courts, and has even appeared at the U.S. Supreme Court.  He has handled cases involving medical malpractice, car accidents, pharmaceutical products, medical devices, oilfield accidents, birth injuries, and more.  Adam’s cases have ranged from leading the fight on behalf of 3,500 clients injured by the pharmaceutical drug Reglan® in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court to trying a case in front of a New Mexico jury on behalf of a widow who lost his spouse due to medical malpractice, and many, many cases in between.

Adam’s greatest joy is fighting zealously for his clients to obtain a favorable result in their case.



In his spare time, Adam enjoys spending time with his wife and two young daughters, reading, running, and tracking the success of Lobos football and Houston Rockets basketball.

Helping educators is our passion
As representatives of Horace Mann, the nation's largest multiline insurance company focusing on the insurance and financial needs of educators, our hearts are in serving the educational community.  We provide auto, home and life insurance, as well as retirement annuities.
Our products and services are designed specifically to provide educators peace of mind – both in and out of the classroom. We also proudly support the work educators do in the classroom every day with a variety of resources and support programs.

Property

Financial Services
Student Loan Solutions



Auto


                                            Our company’s founders believed teachers deserve affordable auto rates.  And, our research shows educators tend to be better drivers.  That’s why educators who qualify get lower rates.  We can also show you how to take advantage of discounts and other cost-cutting strategies.  Plus, as an educator, you may also receive a tailored package of benefits at no additional charge. 


Horace Mann Insurance Company and its affiliates underwrite Horace Mann auto insurance.  Not all benefits available in all states. 






Property


                                            Whether you own a home or condo, or rent a residence, we work hard to make you feel safe at home. Let us ensure your peace of mind by designing a policy that puts the needs of you and your family first.  Plus, educators receive Identity Fraud Advocacy Services to protect against identity theft at no additional charge with their policy.


Horace Mann Insurance Company and its affiliates underwrite Horace Mann home insurance.  Not all benefits available in all states.  





Life


                                            We believe life insurance is the cornerstone of a solid financial plan to help protect your family from financial hardship if they lose you and your income.  Let us help you develop a life insurance portfolio that will provide your family the protection it needs.  We also offer discounted life insurance rates for educators.

Horace Mann Life Insurance Company underwrites Horace Mann life insurance products.  Proof of insurability is required to purchase coverage.    





Financial Services


                                            When preparing for retirement, you may quickly realize relying on your pension and Social Security alone won’t be enough.  Horace Mann offers a variety of options to supplement your savings and help you meet your retirement goals.


We also host, subject to the school’s or district’s approval, financial literacy workshops for school employees to learn detailed information about their state-specific retirement benefits and how to achieve financial success.*
* Workshops are not available in Utah.  




Student Loan Solutions


                                            We will provide you with resources to remove, reduce and redirect your student 
loan payments - whether through federal forgiveness programs, or private refinancing. 
 


Should I refinance my student loans?




Should I take out a loan for my children?


I'm going back to school. What loans are available to me?
