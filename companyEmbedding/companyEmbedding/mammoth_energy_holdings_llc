Products
Muskie can produce a wide variety of products based on the needs of our customers. We collaborate with customers to develop products to help them leverage the highest long-term production of an oil or gas well. We start by producing a majority of the standard proppant sizes as defined by the ISO/API 13503-2 specifications. These grain distributions can be customized to meet the demands of a particular well or frac stage.
Our superior Jordan substrate exhibits the physical properties necessary to withstand the environments of completion and production of the well. The highest quality raw sand from our Northern White (Jordan) deposit exhibits the highest crush resistance of natural substrates. The deposit yields over 50% coarser than the 50 mesh size which is significantly coarser than most deposits even in the Jordan formation. The chemical composition exhibits over 99% monocrystalline quartz. The shape (sphericity and roundness) and strength result in downhole durability and high conductivity. Our hard, rounded grains reduce wear on pumping equipment that minimizes down-time and completion costs.
Our normal production runs provide natural sand proppant in the following size specifications:

20/40 – standard
20/40 – coarse cut
30/50
40/70
Custom Gradations - Due to the flexibility of our plant we offer the ability to make any gradations that our customers need

Mammoth Energy Partners LP has announced plans to become one of Oklahoma City’s next publicly traded firms.
Formerly known as Stingray Energy Services Inc., Mammoth this week told federal regulators it plans to launch an initial public offering worth up to $100 million.
The partnership was formed in February as a holding company called Redback Inc. and became a limited partnership in August. The company is affiliated with Oklahoma City-based Gulfport Energy Corp. and is sponsored by Wexford Capital LP. Wexford owns Mammoth’s general partner, Mammoth Energy Partners GP LLC.
The limited partnership said it will provide oil-field services including pressure pumping in Ohio’s Utica Shale; pressure control services in Oklahoma, Texas and Ohio; and contract drilling in the Permian Basin in west Texas. Mammoth will own 14 drilling rigs, including 11 designed for drilling horizontal wells.
Mammoth Energy Partners said it “has not and will not conduct any material business operations” before the IPO.
At that time, Wexford and Gulfport will contribute to Mammoth the assets of seven affiliated companies: Redback Energy Services LLC; Redback Coil Tubing LLC; Muskie Proppant LLC; Panther Drilling Systems LLC; Bison Drilling & Field Services LLC; Bison Trucking LLC and Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd. Those companies would then become wholly owned subsidiaries of Mammoth.
The seven companies together posted a net loss of nearly $14 million on revenue of almost $133 million in 2013, compared to a loss of $2 million on revenue of almost $58 million in 2012. The companies posted a combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $11.4 million in 2013, up from $10.2 million in 2012.

Rhino Resource Partners LP

                                    Rhino Resource Partners produces a full range of mid to high Btu and low to medium sulfur steam coal for electric utilities across the United States. We also produce metallurgical coal, a key ingredient used by steel producers worldwide. Our available coal qualities span a broad range, which allows us to create a mix that matches a wide variety of customer specifications. In addition to operating coal properties, we manage and lease coal properties and collect royalties from such management and leasing activities. We have also invested in oil and gas mineral rights that have begun to generate revenues for us.

Customers value our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship. Rhino is continuously gaining momentum in an ever-changing industry. We are committed to keeping our employees well-trained and our safety record impeccable.

We have a geographically diverse asset base with coal reserves located in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western Bituminous region. As of December 31, 2012, we controlled an estimated 463.7 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves and an estimated 417.4 million tons of non-reserve coal deposits. Additionally, as of December 31, 2012, our Rhino Eastern joint venture controlled an estimated 43.1 million tons of proven and probable premium metallurgical coal reserves and an estimated 17.9 million tons of non-reserve coal deposits. Excluding results from our Rhino Eastern joint venture, for the year ended December 31, 2012, we sold approximately 4.7 million tons of coal.

Gulfport Energy Corp.

                                    Our Company is a value-driven, growth oriented oil and gas exploration and production company. Operating areas include targeted exploration and exploitation in areas with known major oil resources such as Southern Louisiana and the Permian Basin. Exploration opportunities are pursued in areas where capital investment can generate tremendous upside as shown by exploration and exploitation activities in the Canadian oil sands and natural gas exploration in northern Thailand. In addition, Gulfport has also acquired acreage positions in the Niobrara Formation of Western Colorado and the Utica Shale of Eastern Ohio. 

Gulfport Energy’s core management and technical teams are comprised of proven oil and gas professionals, with experience and expertise in multiple regions including salt dome structures of the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Permian Basin in West Texas.  An entrepreneurial spirit resonates from the executive management team throughout the organization.

We seek to leverage recent technological advancements in the oil and gas industry to fully exploit our principal producing arceages in Southern Louisiana and the Permian Basin while balancing the portfolio with a collection of long-term value opportunities that provide high-impact upside potential, but with minimal initial investment.

The company’s management remains very bullish on the long-term global need and demand for oil and natural gas production and reserves growth.  Prime examples are the company’s 2007 acquisition of producing acreage in the Permian Basin and its' continued investment in the Canadian Oil Sands. With substantial unconventional resources at modest geologic risk, these plays, along with our overseas investment in Thailand, provide the company with a long-term optionality for potential production and resources.

Gulfport Energy believes in an aggressive exploitation drilling program in its proven fields, living within its cash flow and maintaining financial discipline and flexibility

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  We are an integrated, growth-oriented oilfield service company serving companies engaged in the exploration and development of North American onshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserves. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through organic opportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services include completion and production services, natural sand proppant services, contract land and directional drilling services and remote accommodation services. Our completion and production services division provides pressure pumping services, pressure control services, flowback services and equipment rentals. Our natural sand proppant services division sells, distributes and is capable of producing proppant for hydraulic fracturing. Our contract land and directional drilling services division provides drilling rigs and crews for operators as well as rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical and horizontal drilling. Our remote accommodation services division provides housing, kitchen and dining, and recreational service facilities for oilfield workers located in remote areas away from readily available lodging. We believe that these services play a critical role in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from unconventional resources. Our complementary suite of drilling and completion and production related services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our customer base and geographic positioning.  The historical financial information contained in this report relates to periods that ended prior to the completion of the initial public offering, or IPO, of Mammoth Energy Services, Inc., or Mammoth Inc., and the contribution completed prior to the IPO, as discussed below. Consequently, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related discussion of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report pertain to Mammoth Energy Partners LP, which we refer to as the Partnership.  On October 19, 2016, Mammoth Inc. closed its IPO of 7,750,000 shares of common stock, of which 7,500,000 shares were sold by Mammoth Inc. and the remaining 250,000 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders, at a price to the public of $15.00 per share. Mammoth Inc.'s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "TUSK." Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to "we," "our," "us," or like terms, when used in a historical context (periods prior to October 12, 2016) refer to the Partnership. References in this report to "we," "our," "us," or like terms, when used in the present tense or prospectively (periods after October 12, 2016) refer to Mammoth Inc. and its subsidiaries.  On November 24, 2014, Mammoth Energy Holdings LLC, or Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport Energy Corporation, or Gulfport, and Rhino Exploration LLC, or Rhino, contributed to the Partnership their respective interests in the following entities: Bison Drilling and Field Services, LLC, or Bison Drilling; Bison Trucking LLC, or Bison Trucking; White Wing Tubular Services LLC, or White Wing; Barracuda Logistics LLC, or Barracuda; Panther Drilling Systems LLC, or Panther Drilling; Redback Energy Services LLC, or Redback Energy Services; Redback Coil Tubing LLC, or Redback Coil Tubing; Muskie Proppant LLC, or Muskie Proppant; Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC, or Pressure Pumping; Stingray Logistics LLC, or Logistics; and Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., or Lodging. Upon completion of these contributions, Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino beneficially owned a 68.7%, 30.5% and 0.8% equity interest, respectively, in the Partnership. Subsequently, the Partnership formed Redback Pumpdown Services LLC, or Pumpdown, Mr. Inspections LLC, or Mr. Inspections, Silverback Energy Services LLC, or Silverback, and Mammoth Inc. as wholly-owned subsidiaries.  On October 12, 2016, prior to and in connection with the IPO, the Partnership converted to a Delaware limited liability company named Mammoth Energy Partners LLC, or Mammoth LLC, and Mammoth Holdings, Gulfport and Rhino contributed their respective membership interests in Mammoth LLC to Mammoth Inc. in exchange for shares of common stock of Mammoth Inc., and Mammoth LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary.  Industry Overview  The oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and related services and products budget. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and  international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.  Demand for most of our products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 continued into February 2016, when the closing price of oil reached a 12-year low of $26.19 per barrel on February 11, 2016. The low commodity price environment caused a reduction in the drilling, completion and other production activities of most of our customers and their spending on our products and services.  The reduction in demand, and the resulting oversupply of many of the services and products we provide, has substantially reduced the prices we can charge our customers for our products and services, and has had a negative impact on the utilization of our services. This overall trend with respect to our customers' activities and spending has continued in 2016. However, oil prices have increased since the 12-year low recorded on February 26, 2016, reaching $51.23 per barrel in June 2016, and have ranged from $43.04 to $47.72 per barrel during September 2016. As commodity prices have begun to recover, we have experienced an increase in activity. If near term commodity prices stabilize at current levels and recover further, we expect to experience an increase in demand for our services and products, particularly in our completion and production, natural sand proppant and contract land and directional drilling businesses. Our remote accommodation revenue remained stable through the third quarter of 2016. However, we currently project that our remote accommodation revenues will decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016 if we are unable to replace one customer that represented approximately 83.7% of our remote accommodation services during the first nine months of 2016 when it completes the construction phase of its project, which is currently estimated to occur in November 2016.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, impairment of long-lived assets, equity based compensation and other non-operating income or expense, net (which is comprised of the (gain) or loss on disposal of long-lived assets, as well as charges associated with Mammoth Partner's proposed public offering in 2014). We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as and alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.  The following tables also provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income or loss for each of our operating segments for the specified periods.
