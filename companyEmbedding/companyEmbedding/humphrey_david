                          New Products                      


Humphrey is committed to developing new valve solutions suitable for several markets and applications. 
The new Humphrey iDP Solenoid Valve Series is specifically designed for control of difficult media, such as blood, cleaning reagents and aggressive fluids. Constructed of materials suitable for bodily fluids, aggressive chemicals & cleaners and elevated liquid temperatures, the iDP is perfect for the life sciences, on equipment such as analytical devices and kidney dialysis. 
Our Balanced Solenoid Valves has expanded to include both 3-port and 4-port options in 15mm, 19mm, and 25mm sizes as well as IP67 rated, enviromentally protected models. All current valve styles are developed for maximum utility. Each solenoid valve meets a variety of functions with its multi-purpose classification. The Balanced Solenoid Family boasts excellent flow while fitting into tight spaces with their small sizes.
Our new ProControl Valve Series provides variable flow proportional to the amount of current applied to the solenoid. Miniature PC3 is ideal for precise control up to 24 liters per minute flow, while the small PC10 controls up to 65 liters per minute. The newest addition, the large PC30, controls up to 300 liters per minute. The inert construction of both valves makes them an ideal choice for many types of compressible media. View or download technical information at left.
For use with the ProControl Valves, we have introduced the ProControl Driver (PCD), which produces the appropriate current control, either constant current or PWM, to effectively drive any ProControl proportional valve upon receiving signal from a variety of data acquisition sources (ie PLCs, IoT, closed loop sensors, etc). The PCD is unlike any of its competetors in that it is, 100% programmable with fine setting control, no pots or switches to set, and capable of use with any proportional valve specified 1 amp or less with the “custom” setting.
Expanding the ProControl family to go a step beyond single valves, Humphrey adds the ProControl Pressure Regulator Series. These electronic pressure regulators provide outstanding performance, versatility and value. Designed for low volume flow rates (PCRL) or high volume flow rates (PCRH), ProControl regulators precisely sustain outlet pressure, even during dynamic changes in downstream flow rates.
Our new Pilot Valve Series delivers electrically controlled pneumatic interface signals tailored perfectly for the device or equipment maker. The miniature A10 Series Pilot Valve, and the small A15 Series Pilot Valve are manifold mount, low power and affordable. View or download technical information at left. 
The new L310 Latching Direct-Acting Solenoid Valve Series converts momentary electrical signals into maintained pneumatic states, either passing, or not passing. Ideal for applications demanding low power consumption and low heat generation. View or download technical information at left.

                           The U.S. payment system is in the midst of a significant transition. Some of the changes to our payment system, involving
                              its efficiency, the risks inherent in the payment process, and the role of the private and public sectors in the payment mechanism,
                              are the subject of considerable debate and controversy. In recent years, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has played an
                              active part in the development and implementation of policies to improve the payment process. The Bank's operations staff
                              has represented the Federal Reserve System in work with the banking industry to help shape and implement programs to increase
                              efficiency and reduce payment risk. Further, our Research Department has made payment system research an important part of
                              its agenda. The mix of practical experience and research has resulted in a unique perspective on payment system issues that
                              led us to organize a symposium on the U.S. payment system, held on May 25-26, 1988, in Williamsburg, Virginia. Reflecting
                              our belief in the importance of combining both practical experience and theory in addressing payment issues, we invited practi
                              tioners, scholars, and policymakers to share their ideas. The symposium provided an opportunity for those researchers who
                              are studying p- xi PREFACE xii ment issues to present their ideas and to have these ideas evaluated by experienced practitioners

                           October 1997 The cost of providing payment services is substantial- 3 percent of GDP. Cost reduction requires the appropriate
                              pricing of those services. A modern payment system is essential for promoting domestic and international trade and exchange
                              as well as developing financial markets. Payment users will be directed toward the most efficient payment methods when the
                              costs of producing those services are reflected in the prices paid. Resources are being wasted in the United States because
                              consumers see no important difference in transaction prices or bank costs between using a check or using electronic direct
                              debit in paying a bill, even though the social costs of these two instruments are different. Electronic payments cost only
                              a third to half as much as paper-based payments. An estimated $100 billion (or 1.5 percent of GDP) is being lost by the continued
                              use of paper-based checks. When payment instruments are not appropriately priced, the costs must be covered elsewhere. One
                              common solution is to let loan revenues cover part of payment expenses (keeping loan rates higher to compensate). When prices
                              reflect the full cost of producing the service, users demand the services that use the fewest real resources. Humphrey, Keppler,
                              and Montes-Negret give examples of payment prices and price schedules and show how underlying cost data are used to build
                              up to a price. They outline how payment services may best be structured to: * Appropriately reflect economies of scale or
                              scope in the production of payment services. * Adjust cost recovery percentages to accommodate how much demand conditions
                              associated with start-up differ from those associated with mature operation. (During a new system's early years of operation,
                              the transaction volume may be low and some form of underrecovery of costs may be required to encourage use of the system.
                              But any such underrecovery must be built into future pricing arrangements once the systems are established and traffic volumes
                              are at a level where full cost recovery is practical. To ensure fairness, the pricing structure must also guarantee that latecomers
                              to the system do not get more favorable treatment than the initial user group.) * Induce efficient use of scarce resources.
                              They note the economic principles that recommend certain pricing methods over others and apply equally to payment services
                              provided by the private sector or through a government agency. They show why costs should be recovered through user transaction
                              fees. This paper- product of the Financial Sector Development Department- part of a larger effort in the department to promote
                              the development of financial sector infrastructure to support banking and capital market activities

TAMKO Building Products Honored for Exemplary Ethics

Posted on October 13, 2016 by admin

—
No Comments ↓ 


TAMKO Building Products, Inc. was recently recognized for exemplary personal ethics and maintaining a strong, ethical, and compliant culture by the Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics (SCCE). The company — which manufactures roofing products, railing and decking products, waterproofing, cements, and coatings — was awarded the organization’s highest award for “exemplifying the best a company can be in valuing, practicing, and upholding the best in organizational ethics and compliance.”
TAMKO was honored at the SCCE’s Annual Awards Banquet, where Tim Whelan, TAMKO’s executive vice president, accepted the award on behalf of the company’s leadership team.
“These values are not new and they weren’t adopted because of government requirements,” Whelan said when accepting the award. “They were established decades ago by prior generations of leadership and consistently communicated and enforced. These values reflect who we are and we are blessed to get to lead from this foundation.”
Art Weiss, TAMKO’s Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer, serves on the SCCE Executive Board and on the faculty of the Basic Compliance and Ethics Academies. In the March/April 2012 issue of SCCE’s magazine, TAMKO’s philosophy was featured as the cover story.
“In many of the discussions that I have had with compliance professionals, I have shared TAMKO’s philosophy of treating others with dignity and respect, our Rule of Basic Honesty, and David Humphreys’ metaphor about keeping your conduct between the hash marks,” Weiss said.
TAMKO is a family-owned company, and David Humphreys, the grandson of TAMKO’s founder, is the company’s current President and CEO. Under his leadership, the company has continued to uphold the honest and ethical values on which it was founded.
“This is the first time that SCCE has given an award to a leadership team for being a role model for leadership support for compliance and ethics,” Weiss said. “I speak to many compliance professionals who are looking for advice on how to gain the support of their senior management for the compliance program. In those organizations, the culture is just not there. That is what makes TAMKO so unique and what was recognized by SCCE.”
The SCCE has been acknowledging ethical individuals and organizations since 2005.

TAMKO Presents Donation to Joplin NALA

Posted on October 12, 2016 by admin

No Comments ↓ 


TAMKO Building Products, Inc. recently donated $5,000 to the Joplin Neighborhood Adult Literacy Action (NALA), an organization that serves to foster and strengthen literacy skills to enable learners to reach their full potential. The organization’s mission is to “close the book on literacy” through recruiting and tutoring adults who need help in reading, writing, math, and/or English as a second language, to provide programs to increase the family’s awareness of the value of reading, and to coordinate with community resources. NALA also recruits and trains volunteers.
Recently, NALA endured a $12,000 reduction in funding from another organization. To help the organization deal with the budget shortage, TAMKO presented a $5,000 check to NALA. After NALA reached out to TAMKO for assistance, the donation was presented on behalf of TAMKO and its President and CEO David Humphreys on August 18, 2016.
TAMKO is a leading privately-owned manufacturer of residential and commercial roofing products, headquartered in Joplin. In addition to providing quality building products and outstanding service, it is TAMKO’s mission to support the communities where it is located.
TAMKO was proud to support such an amazing cause. NALA provides instrumental services and programs to Joplin families. In the United States, illiteracy is a major problem that’s often overlooked. According to the NALA website, millions of adults in America are illiterate, with millions barely able to read. Children who are raised in households with an illiterate parent are 50% more likely to not perform well in school, to drop out of school, and to be illiterate themselves. NALA helps close the literacy gap and empower Joplin families.

No Comments ↓ 


TAMKO Building Products, Inc., one of the country’s largest privately-owned manufacturers of commercial and residential roofing and building products, was the presenting sponsor of the 9th Annual Race 4 Hope event. This was the sixth consecutive year that TAMKO sponsored the event.
The Race 4 Hope benefits the Hope 4 You Breast Cancer Foundation and included a 5k race, 1 mile walk, and survivor ceremony. For the second year, TAMKO earned the award for largest corporate team. TAMKO had 30 employees from Corporate, High Street, Engineering & Construction, and Lamar participate in the event.  Additionally, several TAMKO employees were acknowledged in their age groups for their finishing times. TAMKO Corporate Director of Research and Development Andre Lacour placed second overall.
“We are very proud to sponsor this event and are even more delighted to have had runners that placed,” said Stephanie Onstot, TAMKO Community Relations Associate. “The team effort and participation just goes to show how our employees value this organization and the community.”
The Race 4 Hope event was held on Saturday, June 4, 2016 at the Missouri Southern State University campus in Joplin, Missouri. The event proceeds benefited the Hope 4 You Breast Cancer Foundation, an organization that works with local communities to raise awareness, offer education, provide support and instill hope in individuals and families impacted by breast cancer.
At the Hope 4 You Breast Cancer Foundation, Hope stands for “Help, Outreach, Prevent, and Educate.” While there are many national and international organizations that work to end breast cancer, Hope 4 You was founded by individuals and corporations to provide support locally in the Joplin-area.  TAMKO and its President and CEO David Humphreys are proud to support such a wonderful cause.

TAMKO Donated $12,000 to Sponsor JHS Constitution Team

Posted on July 14, 2016 by admin

No Comments ↓ 



TAMKO Building Products, Inc., one of the largest privately-owned manufacturers of commercial and residential roofing products, recently donated $12,000 to the Joplin, Missouri High School (JHS) Constitution Team. The donation was made to help the team fund their trip to the national “We The People” competition in Washington D.C. The competition was held April 22-26, 2016.
With a total of 15 team members, the JHS Constitution Team had a difficult time raising all the funds needed for their journey to Washington D.C. The estimated cost for the trip was $1,600 per student, making it rather expensive to attend the competition. Fortunately, TAMKO Building Products stepped in to sponsor the team so the group could compete at the national level.
“I’ve had a few team members come to me and explain that they weren’t sure they could raise the funds needed for their portion of the trip, so they were willing to excuse themselves from the competition,” said William Keczkemethy, JHS Teacher and Constitution Team Coach. “It was devastating.  But now, they no longer have that burden thanks to the generous donation from TAMKO.”
He continued, “I want to express my appreciation for TAMKO. This donation demonstrates how important local businesses are in our education system. When we support local businesses, these businesses can support local education.”
TAMKO President and CEO David Humphreys said, “We think it’s important to support students in our area, especially when they reach this level of national competition. TAMKO has supported the JHS Constitution Team in the past and we are happy to continue that support this year.”
Founded in 1944 in Joplin, TAMKO Building Products, Inc. is one of the nation’s largest privately-owned manufacturers of commercial and residential roofing products, decking and railing products, cements, coatings and waterproofing. To learn more about TAMKO, visit www.tamko.com.

A History of TAMKO’s Leadership 

23 Jan 2017

 admin Leave a comment





Founded in 1944, TAMKO Building Products, Inc. has provided building products for the professional for more than 70 years. The company, which started out as a small shingle manufacturer in a streetcar barn in Joplin, Missouri, has grown into one of the largest privately-owned manufacturers of building products in the United States. Today, TAMKO has manufacturing plants and offices located across the country, with a product line that has expanded to include commercial and residential roofing products, composite decking and railings, waterproofing, and cements and coatings. Read on to learn about TAMKO’s leadership, which has made the company what it is today.
E.L. Craig founded TAMKO in 1944 in an old streetcar barn on High Street in Joplin, Missouri. The company began production with a single shingle line. When it was founded, TAMKO employed 35 people but was already planning to employ up to 75 people. By 1946, the company started to expand when E.L. purchased Joe Jones Refinery to produce asphalt for the High Street plant.  That location quickly expanded into a felt mill to produce the other major raw material used in shingles at the time.
E.L.’s wife, Mary Ethel Craig, is responsible for naming the company TAMKO. The name came from the first letters of the five states the couple anticipated as the company’s sales territory— Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. In 1954, Mary Ethel assumed the leadership of TAMKO due to E.L’s health. The couple’s daughter, Ethelmae, led TAMKO’s operations in the 1950s and continues today as the company’s chairman.
In 1960, Ethelmae’s husband, Jay Humphreys, became president of TAMKO and led the company for the next 33 years. Under his leadership, TAMKO added manufacturing plants in Phillipsburg, Kansas; Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Knoxville, Tennessee; Frederick, Maryland; and Dallas, Texas, as well as expanding its product line.
After Jay’s death in 1993, David Humphreys, Jay and Ethelmae’s oldest son, was named President and CEO of TAMKO. Under David’s leadership, TAMKO continues to grow at a rapid pace and expand its production capabilities for additional products.

TAMKO Donates to Carl Junction Middle School Archery Team 

12 Oct 2016

 admin Leave a comment





TAMKO Building Products, Inc. recently made a donation to the Carl Junction Middle School (CJMS) Archery Team, so the team could participate in a world archery tournament. The National Archery in the Schools Program (NASP) World Tournament was held in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina from June 23-26, where more than 4,000 student archers from the United States, Canada, and Mongolia competed for prizes and scholarships.
The CJMS Archery Team, which is comprised of sixth, seventh, and eighth graders, qualified for the world competition, though only being in its second year. Prior to the world competition, the team competed locally, regionally, and nationally. The team competed in local tournaments in January and consistently took first, second, and third place. Then, the archers placed second out of nine teams at the Southwest Missouri Regional Tournament in February. They advanced to the state competition, to the national tournament, and finally to the world tournament, where the team successfully finished 34th out of 79 teams.
TAMKO’s $2,500 donation helped the team travel to the world tournament in South Carolina.
“None of these amazing endeavors would be possible without our community and the businesses that see value in the National Archery in the Schools Program,” said CJMS Volunteer Coach Tami Fredrickson.
“It’s a joy to see local teams rising to this impressive level of competition,” said TAMKO President and CEO David Humphreys. “TAMKO has always been a big supporter of local youth and their sports teams. This donation is a reflection of our continued commitment to our local community and youth.”
Recently, the company also donated $1,000 to the Joplin Softball Little League team. The donation was to help the team fund their travels to a state tournament held in St. Louis, Missouri.
“TAMKO has been a part of Joplin and the surrounding communities for more than 70 years,” David Humphreys said of the donation. “Youth sports are an important part of our community, which is why we are pleased to make this donation.”

TAMKO Building Products Sponsors ‘Everyday Heroes’ Luncheon 

8 Aug 2016

 admin Leave a comment





TAMKO Building Products, a Joplin-based privately-owned manufacturer of roofing and building products, recently sponsored the American Red Cross “Everyday Heroes” luncheon, which honored people in the Joplin, Missouri community who went above and beyond to make the community a better place. This year’s award recipients were all inspirational. They ranged from a group of former foster kids who provide care packages for children entering foster care, to a group of police officers who replaced a 5-year-old’s bicycle after it was destroyed by a suspect fleeing police.
In total, five awards were distributed to Joplin’s Everyday Heroes. As the keynote speaker, TAMKO Executive Vice President Tim Whelan recognized these individuals for their selfless and heroic behavior.
“One of the traits I think heroes hold that sets them apart, and that challenges and inspires us, is selflessness,” Whelan said. “Heroes are selfless. They focus on others and not on themselves. These stories inspire us.”
This year’s Everyday Heroes included:

Mason Hymer, Mackenzie Hymer, Abbey Goebel, and Mati Goebel, former foster kids who created Bundles of Hope, a nonprofit that has collected and distributed 1,500 new-home kits to kids entering the foster care system. The kits include blankets, stuffed animals, pajamas, toiletries, and other items to help them and their foster parents. The bundles also include a note of encouragement to help kids adjust and feel more comfortable.


Jim Whitney, a Joplin High School coach, who accepted the award on behalf of his students, who wanted to remain anonymous. His students founded an organization called “Doulos” in 2008, which provides students with basic needs, such as clothing, coats, and shoes.


Becky Graves, who created the Baby and Infant Loss Support Group and the 5K “Kiss Me Goodnight” Twilight Run to support families who suffered the loss of a baby.


A team of Joplin Police Department officers who replaced a bicycle for a 5-year-old boy whose bike, a Christmas gift the previous day, was destroyed when it was run over by a fleeing suspect.


Joplin Police Department detectives Adam and Amy New, who rescued two sisters, ages 3 and 5, from a pond near their home on December 22.

 admin Leave a comment






TAMKO Building Products, Inc., one of the nation’s largest privately-owned manufacturers of building products recently announced it has signed an endorsement agreement with John Isner, the ATP Tour’s #1 ranked American male tennis player.
“We are excited to have American tennis star John Isner become our brand ambassador,” said David Humphreys, TAMKO President and Chief Executive Officer. “His ability on-court, his pursuit of success and his passion for the game make him an excellent representative for TAMKO.”
John Isner is the top ranked American male tennis player on the APT World Tour and the #16 ranked player overall. Isner became a pro tennis player in 2007 and is known for having one of the most powerful and quickest swings in the sport. Since going pro, he has accumulated 10 ATP singles titles, as well as three doubles titles. He accomplished his highest ranking on the ATP World Tour in 2012 at #9. Isner currently has the most aces in ATP World Tour history. At Wimbledon in 2010, Isner played the longest match in the history of tennis.
“TAMKO has such a distinguished past in construction and I am excited to begin my partnership with the brand,” said Isner. “My dad has used TAMKO products for years for his business, Greensboro Contracting, and to be partners with a brand that has been instrumental in the success of my family’s business means a lot to me.”
Founded in 1944, TAMKO Building Products is a leading manufacturer of residential and commercial roofing products, including Heritage® Asphalt Shingles and MetalWorks® Steel Shingles, as well as decking and railing products, waterproofing, cements, and coatings.

New Proportional iDP Valve – 390 and 391 Series



The iDP Series of aggressive media solenoid valves has expanded.  The diaphragm isolated 390 series 2-port proportional valve delivers a variable output flow of aggressive chemicals and cleaning fluids … from a corresponding variable input current to its solenoid.
Similar to the 350 series ON/OFF direct solenoid valve in flow, size and shape, the 390 is the first of its kind in proportional control. For example, users of the 390 Series may now control liquid chemical flow “rate” under variable pressure conditions, or may vary the chemical dilution when mixing with water.
Available as inline (390 Series) or as manifold (391 Series and to upstream pressure settings of 10, 20 and 40 psig.
For more information on Proportional iDP 390 Series, and all iDP Valves, download the updated iDP brochure.
 






Balanced Valve has new options, including IP67 Protection



The Humphrey Balanced Solenoid Valve family of 3- and 4-port direct acting valves now includes IP67 rated, environmentally protected models. 
Solenoid modifications and extensive testing has certified IP67 models to withstand dust ingress completely, and submersion in water to a depth of one meter over 30 minutes.  IP67 models are limited to DIN electrical entry and without override.  Humphrey DIN connector HS2-CLL is suitable for IP67 protection as well. 
The IP67 requirement is quite challenging, and therefore quite saleable to food processing and packaging OEMs and their end users, as well other moisture laden or wash down applications. 
Additionally, we’ve added fluorocarbon elastomers to the Balanced Valve offering for those chemical and temperature compatibility applications.  Finally, metric piping ports in both “G” and “Rc” threads are now available for OEMs marketing equipment internationally.
Download the brochure for more information.
 






ProControl Proportional Valve Driver - PCD



We are pleased to introduce our latest product within the Humphrey ProControl family, the PCD proportional valve driver. The PCD produces the appropriate current control, either constant current or PWM, to effectively drive any ProControl proportional valve upon receiving signal from a variety of data acquisition sources (ie PLCs, IoT, closed loop sensors, etc).
Ideally suited for product development, laboratories and production environments, the PCD is flexible and user friendly. The PCD features an LCD screen, scroll wheel and pushbutton parameter setting, and tool-less connectivity making set-up fast and easy. Pre-programming includes default settings for all Humphrey ProControl valves and a custom setting for unique application settings. Each PCD is shipped with installation instructions. Unlike competitive proportional valve drivers, the PCD is 100% programmable with fine setting control, no pots or switches to set, and capable of use with any proportional valve specified 1 amp or less with the “custom” setting. It accepts a variety of control signals, namely 0-5v, 0-10v or 4-20mA. Included is short circuit and reverse polarity protection.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
