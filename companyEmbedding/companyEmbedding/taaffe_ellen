When the family heirs to the legendary Galimir String quartet gathered to commemorate the centenary birth years of these famed performers , they chose Ellen Taaffe Zwilich to commission for this honor. The composers, who have also worked professionally as a violinist, responded with a one-movement odyssey entitled Voyage, cross breeding her own characteristic style with glimpses of Viennese waltzes an other Galimir flavors.

"This is the way we learn as composers, by hearing our work
          in public."


Ellen Taaffe Zwilich
Francis Eppes Professor
            School of Music 


Winner of the Pulitzer Prize (the first female in
            music), four Grammy nominations, an Academy Award (from the American
            Academy of Arts and Letters), named to the first Composer's Chair
            in the history of Carnegie Hall, recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship
            and five honorary doctorates…
          
For some artists, a long list of awards hardens into a barrier between
            them and their audience. Not so for Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, an Eppes
            Professor in the FSU School of Music, who still composes to connect
            with people. 
Audience reaction, she says, is vital to refining one's work: "This
            is the way we learn as composers, by hearing our work in public."
Apparently she's an expert "learner." Baker's Biographical
              Dictionary of Musicians offers this retrospective on her work: "There
              are not many composers in the modern world who possess the lucky
              combination of writing music of substance and at the same time
              exercising an immediate appeal to mixed audiences. Zwilich offers
              this happy combination of purely technical excellence and a distinct
              power of communication." 
Her music, which is performed and recorded by leading orchestras
            and ensembles, and listened to by audiences the world over, is known
            as distinct—music that is immediately recognized as her product
            and that reflects her optimistic and humanistic spirit. 
After receiving BA and MA degrees in music composition from FSU,
            and a doctorate from the Juilliard School, Zwilich was invited to
            play violin in the American Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski
            (from 1965 to 1972). She then devoted herself to composing full-time. 
The rest of the story is beautiful music, which has been commissioned
            by such notables as the New York Philharmonic, the Abe Fortas Memorial
            Fund of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Chamber
            Music Society of Lincoln Center, and Carnegie Hall.
Tap into the Zwilich sound: Many of her works are available on CD and
          are performed here on campus by local and visiting musicians.

Faculty and ResearchThe Kellogg School faculty is an esteemed group of scholars and practitioners, and members provide a rich source of international experience in professional management problems and practices. Faculty members combine real-world and academic knowledge of management problems to augment their theoretical training. Senior faculty members also teach courses to senior executives through the Kellogg School’s executive programs. This approach reinforces faculty research and keeps faculty members abreast of changes in corporate practices. All Kellogg School courses combine theory and practice. Teaching methods include case study, field study, seminars, simulations, and independent work. Faculty members choose the method most appropriate to the material and their individual styles. Research is a vital component of Kellogg’s program, and faculty members have developed groundbreaking theories in many academic fields, such as marketing, banking, strategy, and game theory. There are several research centers, on topics ranging from dispute resolution to banking. Several scholarly journals are edited at Kellogg, two of which—the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy and Games and Economic Behavior—were founded here. The Journal of Financial Intermediation was also founded at Kellogg.

Ellen Taaffe ZwilichBorn: 1939Nationality: AmericanPublisher: AMPPhoto © Cori Wells BraunAs the 21st century dawns and the musical offerings of the world are more varied than ever before, few composers have emerged with the unique personality of Ellen Taaffe Zwilich. Her music is widely known because it is performed, recorded, broadcast, and above all, listened to and liked by all sorts of audiences the world over.  Like the great masters of bygone times, Zwilich produces music "with fingerprints," music that is immediately recognized as the product of a particular American composer who combines craft and inspiration in reflecting her optimistic and humanistic spirit in her compositions. Ellen Zwilich is the recipient of numerous prizes and honors, including the 1983 Pulitzer Prize in Music (the first woman ever to receive this coveted award), the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Chamber Music Prize, the Arturo Toscanini Music Critics Award, the Ernst von Dohnanyi Citation, and Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Guggenheim Fellowship, four Grammy nominations, and, among other distinctions, she has been elected to the Florida Artists Hall of Fame and the American Academy of Arts and Letters.  In 1995, she was named to the first Composer's Chair in the history of Carnegie Hall, and she was designated Musical America's Composer of the Year in 1999. A prolific composer in all media except opera, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's works have been performed by virtually all of the leading American orchestras and by major ensembles abroad.  Her music first came to public attention when Pierre Boulez conducted her Symposium for Orchestra at Juilliard (1975), but it was the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for the Symphony No. 1 that brought her instantly into international focus.  Commissions and major performances and recordings soon followed: the Symphony No. 2 (Cello Symphony), premiered by Edo de Waart and the San Francisco Symphony; the Symphony No. 3, written for the New York Philharmonic's 150th anniversary; and the Symphony No. 4 ("The Gardens") with chorus, commissioned by Michigan State University; the string of concertos for solo instruments and orchestra, commissioned and performed by top orchestras ­ for piano (Detroit Symphony, Günther Herbig), trombone (Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Sir Georg Solti), flute (Boston Symphony Orchestra, Seiji Ozawa), oboe (Cleveland Orchestra, Christoph von Dohnányi), violin and cello (Louisville Orchestra, Lawrence Leighton Smith), bass trombone (Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Daniel Barenboim), French horn (Rochester Philharmonic, Lawrence Leighton Smith), bassoon (Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Lorin Maazel), trumpet (San Diego Symphony, JoAnn Falletta), Triple Concerto for piano, violin and cello (Minnesota Orchestra, Zdenek Macal), and violin (Orchestra of St. Luke's, Hugh Wolff).Her orchestral essay Symbolon was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic expressly to receive its world premiere in what was then Leningrad.  Zubin Mehta subsequently performed it in Europe and America and recorded it on the New World label; and Carnegie Hall's 1997 family concert series featured Peanuts Gallery for piano and orchestra, based on Charles Schulz' Peanuts characters.Her chamber works have been commissioned by the Boston Musica Viva (Chamber Symphony, Passages), the Abe Fortas Memorial Fund of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, 92nd Street Y and San Francisco Performances (Piano Trio), the New York State School Music Teachers Association (Divertimento), the McKim Fund in the Library of Congress (Romances for Violin), the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival and Chamber Music Northwest (Clarinet Quintet), the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center (Double Quartet), and Carnegie Hall (String Quartet No. 2).
