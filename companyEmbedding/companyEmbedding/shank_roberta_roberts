Knight Transportation Appoints Roberta Roberts Shank and Robert Synowicki to Board of Directors; Donald Bliss Appointed Director Emeritus | Business Wire
























































Knight Transportation Appoints Roberta Roberts Shank and Robert 
      Synowicki to Board of Directors; Donald Bliss Appointed Director Emeritus






February 10, 2016 04:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Knight Transportation, Inc. (NYSE: KNX), one of North America’s largest 
      and most diversified truckload transportation companies, today announced 
      that Roberta "Sissie" Roberts Shank and Robert Synowicki, Jr. have 
      joined Knight's board of directors. Donald A. Bliss, director since 
      1995, has retired from the board of directors and has been named as a 
      Director Emeritus in recognition of his substantial contributions to the 
      company's growth and development.
    

      Chairman of the Board, Kevin P. Knight, offered the following comments: 
      "We are extremely pleased to welcome Sissie Roberts Shank and Bob 
      Synowicki to our board. We look forward to their contributions and 
      believe their skill sets and experience will contribute to our 
      organization in key areas as we continue to grow our multiple truckload 
      services. In addition, we appreciate maintaining access to Don Bliss' 
      unique perspective and counsel as Director Emeritus.
    

      "Sissie Roberts Shank serves as Chief Executive Officer and President of 
      Chas Roberts A/C and Plumbing, a major Phoenix-based company with 
      approximately 600 employees. Ms. Roberts' experience in leading her 
      company through the rapid growth, downturn, and comeback of the 
      construction market, while adjusting its scale and re-growing 
      profitability, will align nicely with our focus on cost control and 
      stockholder returns. Moreover, she is experienced in managing a 
      workforce with distributed, mobile employees and substantial hiring and 
      retention challenges. Her expertise has been recognized by being named 
      2014 CEO of the Year by the Arizona Corporate Excellence Awards for the 
      state's largest private businesses, as well as receiving the Greater 
      Phoenix Chamber of Commerce Impact Award for 2013, and being named a 
      finalist for the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year for the Mountain 
      Desert Region for 2013.
    

      "Bob Synowicki brings substantial trucking, information technology, and 
      general business experience to our board. In more than 25 years as an 
      executive of Werner Enterprises, Mr. Synowicki served as Chief Financial 
      Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Information Officer, and 
      Executive Vice President of Driver Resources. Very few people in our 
      industry have his depth and breadth of exposure to the critical areas of 
      driver development, effective use of technology, accounting, and 
      operations. In addition, Bob is a Certified Public Accountant, as well 
      as Chairman of the Finance Committee and member of the Audit Committee 
      of Blue Cross Blue Shield – Nebraska. Previously, he served as a board 
      member of the American Trucking Associations and the Truckload Carriers 
      Association.
    

      "On behalf of our entire board of directors and everyone at Knight, I 
      would like to recognize and thank Don Bliss for his substantial 
      contributions to the success of Knight Transportation. Don joined the 
      board just after our IPO, when we were a small, southwestern based 
      carrier. Over the ensuing 21 years, Don helped guide us through 
      expanding to nationwide service, opening up new business units, and 
      transitioning from a family-run business to an industry leader with next 
      generation professional management. Throughout his tenure, Don insisted 
      on both public company corporate governance and respect for the culture 
      instilled originally by the Knight family. At age 83, Don deserves the 
      right to slow down, and we are pleased and honored to have him move to a 
      position as Director Emeritus."

CEO Roberta Roberts Shank faced immediate challenges when she took over Chas Roberts Air Conditioning Inc. after her father died in 1999.
As a young female executive in a male-dominated industry, Shank led a team of experienced managers who had known her as a kid — and some of them still perceived her that way.

                            Roberta Roberts Shank                        










 


Fortunately, Shank’s years of work in her Phoenix-based, family-owned business included time spent in each division, giving her a breadth of knowledge about the company.
After becoming CEO, she sought to expand her leadership knowledge by joining Vistage, a peer advisory group for CEOs, business owners and senior executives.





Shank also met regularly with her managers, but some refused to take direction from a younger woman. After about six months, Shank took action and fired several of them.
“The turning point was when I was not getting respect that I felt … the position certainly deserved,” she said.
The bold move not only demonstrated Shank’s willingness to make tough choices, but also one of her core philosophies: No one person is more important than the success of the whole.
“I saw what a powerful leader my father was, and I figured if the company could survive without him, it could survive certainly without me or any other single person,” she said. “I’m really just a custodian for my time here.”
