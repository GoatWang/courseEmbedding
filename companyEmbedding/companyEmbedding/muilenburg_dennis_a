Executive Biography of Dennis A. Muilenburg









Dennis A. Muilenburg
Chairman, President and Chief Executive OfficerThe Boeing Company




Dennis Muilenburg is chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of The Boeing Company.
Muilenburg, 53, oversees the strategic direction of the Chicago-based, $94.6 billion aerospace company. With roughly 150,000 employees across the United States and in more than 65 countries, Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company and top U.S. exporter. It is the leading manufacturer of commercial airplanes, military aircraft, and space and security systems, and a provider of global services; it supports airlines and U.S. and allied government customers in more than 150 nations.
Muilenburg became chairman of the board in March 2016, chief executive officer in July 2015 and president in December 2013.
Until July 2015, Muilenburg served as vice chairman, president and chief operating officer of Boeing, where he supported the company’s aerospace business operations and focused on specific growth enablers, including important global relationships, leadership initiatives and development program performance.
Before that, Muilenburg served as president and chief executive officer of Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS).
Earlier, Muilenburg was president of BDS’s Global Services & Support business, vice president and general manager of the Boeing Combat Systems division, and program manager for Future Combat Systems. Prior to that, he served as vice president of Programs & Engineering for Boeing Air Traffic Management and director of Weapon Systems for the proposed Boeing Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. He also held program management and engineering positions on F-22, Airborne Laser, High Speed Civil Transport and the Condor reconnaissance aircraft, among others.
Muilenburg, who joined Boeing in 1985, spent the first 15 years of his career in the Puget Sound region of Washington, where he held a number of program management and engineering positions in support of both the commercial airplanes and defense businesses.
Muilenburg is a member of the board of directors of Caterpillar Inc., the U.S.-China Business Council, the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation and FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science & Technology). He also is chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) board of governors and is an executive committee member of Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. companies. He also serves on the boards of trustees for the National World War II Museum and Washington University (St. Louis).
He is a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and the Royal Aeronautical Society.
A native of Iowa, Muilenburg holds a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering and an honorary doctor of science degree from Iowa State University as well as a master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics from the University of Washington.

      Muilenburg started as Boeing intern; now he’s CEO      







Originally published June 23, 2015 at 1:43 pm

Dennis Muilenburg will become Boeing’s chief executive July 1, succeeding Jim McNerney, who held the position for the past 10 years.

By 

Rami Grunbaum
 
Seattle Times deputy business editor 


Jim McNerney, the outsider who wrenchingly transformed Boeing into a bicoastal manufacturer while extracting major concessions from union members and state officials, will step down July 1 after a decade as CEO and hand the reins to Dennis Muilenburg, a 30-year company man who started as an engineering intern.
Muilenburg, 51, has been Boeing’s president, chief operating officer and vice chairman since 2013. That promotion, after four years as head of Boeing’s defense division in St. Louis, had made him the clear favorite to replace McNerney.
He “is quite respected in the industry and the investor community, although he’s not really familiar with the commercial side” of Boeing’s business, said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group.


Despite working “almost exclusively on the defense side,” Muilenburg represents “a step in the right direction” because he comes from an engineering background, said Aboulafia.



 


Dennis Muilenburg

Age: 51
Education: BA in aerospace engineering from Iowa State University; master’s in aeronautics and astronautics from the University of Washington.
Career: Engineering intern in Seattle in 1985; held numerous program management and engineering positions of increasing responsibility early in his career, including on the company’s High Speed Civil Transport, F-22, Airborne Laser and Condor reconnaissance aircraft; led Boeing’s Combat Systems division; president of the unit’s Global Services and Support business; CEO of Boeing Defense Space and Security since 2009; Boeing president, vice chairman and chief operating officer since 2013.

McNerney, 65, will continue as Boeing’s chairman and will remain a company employee until February to ensure a smooth transition and to “continue advocating on issues important to Boeing’s U.S. and global customers, partners and stakeholders, including ongoing Washington, D.C., engagement,” the company said.
The largest union at Boeing, the Machinists, issued a brief statement that underscored the bitterness of its relationship with McNerney.
“CEOs come and CEOs go,” began the two-sentence note from District 751 President Jon Holden. It continued, “We welcome Boeing’s announcement that Dennis Muilenburg is taking over as CEO, and encourage him to invest in the workforce and recognize the value of each and every employee at the Boeing Co.”
Bill Dugovich, communications director for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), said, “We haven’t met with Mr. Muilenburg … we’ll just have to wait and see.”
Muilenburg earned a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering from Iowa State University and a master’s in aeronautics and astronautics from the University of Washington, according to Boeing.
The defense business where he made his mark has shrunk in recent years as federal military spending was reined in, although it’s considered “a pretty well-run unit,” said Aboulafia.

It was Muilenburg’s “leadership characteristics” that apparently made him the candidate to succeed McNerney, said analyst Adam Pilarski of Avitas.
By becoming CEO of Boeing in his early 50s, “he has quite a few years to transform it in the ways he thinks are best,” Pilarski said.
It’s not clear what changes Muilenburg might pursue in Boeing’s leadership ranks, product lineup or labor practices. Because he’s played a low-key role as chief operating officer, said industry analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham.net, little about his outlook on key issues has emerged.
“He really is an enigma to me and to the unions,” Hamilton said.


But some of the challenges ahead are clear.
Boeing still has as much as $30 billion in deferred production costs on the 787 Dreamliner, a hole that is projected to continue deepening until next year.

“Eventually you have to start producing planes at a profit, and that’s a big, big challenge,” said Pilarski.
There is also danger in the massive ramp-up of aircraft production planned by both Boeing and Airbus to meet the unprecedented orders they’ve piled up — nearly 12,000 between them even before this month’s Paris Air Show. Boeing has announced it will raise 737 production to 52 per month by 2018, while Airbus aims for 50 single-aisle planes a month by 2017.
“I’m one of the people who believes we may have a bubble, so he (Muilenburg) better start thinking what if it’s a bubble and you have to go down in production rather than up,” said Pilarski.
He added that even a Boeing CEO who shared that concern would “have to pretend” he’s planning to ramp up production or risk losing future orders to Airbus.
Hamilton said Muilenburg will also face important decisions on whether to continue production of the slow-selling 747 jumbo jet, and how to proceed on a “middle-of-the-market” jet that, beginning in 2025, might replace the discontinued 757 as a plane intermediate in size between the 737 single-aisle family and the 787.
On the defense side, said Aboulafia, the company’s future in combat aircraft will be decided by an upcoming Pentagon contract award for a major new stealth bomber. If a Boeing-Lockheed Martin partnership loses to Northrop Grumman, Boeing’s only option for staying in that business may be to buy the winner, he said.
McNerney legacy
Almost a year ago, McNerney told investment analysts he didn’t plan to retire upon turning 65 the following month because “the heart will still be beating, the employees will still be cowering.” That remark quickly drew outrage from Boeing employees, and McNerney apologized for it within days, calling it an inept joke.
McNerney, who will be 66 in August, was a disciple of longtime General Electric chief Jack Welch before leaving to run 3M. He is widely regarded as a financial disciplinarian who, despite running GE’s engine division, had less grounding in the airplane business than most of his Boeing predecessors.
At Boeing, he proved polarizing but stayed unscathed through the troubled rollout of the 787, and Tuesday’s announcement comes during a year when Boeing’s stock is at all-time highs.
He inherited the scheme of building major chunks of the 787 at outsourced plants in South Carolina. But, when those factories proved unreliable, he took control of them and turned the operation into a full-fledged second production site for Boeing’s most advanced twin-aisle jet.
The same playbook was used when it came time to choose a site for the company’s newest airliner, the 777X. Under McNerney’s guidance, Boeing threatened to take the plane elsewhere unless Machinists agreed to end the company’s pension contributions and the Legislature extended aerospace tax breaks for two more decades.
After sealing those deals and putting the 777X plants in Everett, Boeing surprised labor and government officials by revealing that several thousand engineering jobs would be moved to new sites in other states.






Aboulafia said McNerney’s handling of the unions risked losing valuable skills and crucial collaboration at a time when Boeing really needed them — “kind of a worst-case scenario from a labor-management perspective.”
“I can only think that any change will be for the better on that front, so that’s good news,” he said.
Pilarski said that when it comes to CEOs, “Obviously everyone wants Wall Street and investors to be happy.” But speaking of Muilenburg, he continued, “I don’t think his priority will be as strongly aligned with them as Jim’s is.”
Pay package
Muilenburg will receive a base salary of $1.6 million and target bonus of $2.7 million a year in his new post, Boeing said in a regulatory filing. In addition, he’ll get 18,709 restricted shares that vest in three years and are worth nearly $2.7 million at Boeing’s current stock price of $144.
As president and chief operating officer, Muilenburg had been earning $1.1 million annually and in 2014 received total compensation of nearly $7.3 million, Boeing reported in March.
The company said McNerney will be paid at an annual rate of $1.5 million until his retirement in February.






Boeing reported in March that McNerney’s total compensation for 2014 was nearly $29 million.
Boeing said Ray Conner, the president and CEO of its commercial-airplanes unit based in Seattle, will continue as vice chairman, a title he had shared with Muilenburg.

The world’s largest aerospace company is waving farewell to CEO W. James McNerney as his successor, Dennis Muilenburg, takes over duties as CEO of Boeing today.
Muilenburg’s takeover happens to coincide with a few milestones. This year marks Muilenburg’s thirty year anniversary with Boeing, during which he ran the military branch of the company and served as president and COO. Additionally, Boeing is gearing up to celebrate its centennial next year.
McNerny described Muilenburg as well-respected and passionate. He also has the reputation for being dynamic, focused and hyper-competitive.
Loren Thompson of Forbes writes, “He shares [former Boeing CEO] McNerney’s affinity for sports and exercise, often bicycling dozens of miles in a day, but there is an intensity to his personality that one seldom encounters elsewhere in the button-down aerospace sector.”
Here are other fun facts that you might not have known about Muilenburg:
He’s an avid cyclist.
The Wall Street Journal piece on Muilenburg entitled “Boeing’s Incoming CEO Is Engineer With Swagger” notes that the new CEO spends a lot of time on his bicycle and is “on pace for riding 6,000 miles this year.” He apparently rides about 120 miles per week around the Chicago area, where Boeing is headquartered.
He began working at Boeing as an intern.
51-year-old Muilenburg has spent the better part of his life as a Boeing employee. He started off as an engineering intern with the company in 1985 and worked his way up to the top position over 30 years.
He’s a huge fan of Diet Mountain Dew.
According to Jon Ostrower and Doug Cameron of The Wall Street Journal, those who have worked with Muilenburg say that he gets his jolt from chugging Diet Mountain Dew instead of coffee, the more traditional energy booster.
He is an engineer first.
Muilenburg received his bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering from Iowa State University and his master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics from the University of Washington. Christopher Drew of The New York Times writes, “Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said Boeing’s engineers would cheer the return, in Mr. Muilenburg, of an engineer to the chief executive’s suite.” Previous CEO McNerney had a lackluster reputation for fostering positive labor relations, and some think that Muilenburg’s engineering background could make him a better fit for navigating those issues.

  On July 1, Dennis A. Muilenburg became Boeing's new
  CEO — 30 years after joining the company as an intern.

The Chicago-based airplane maker decided to
  promote from within its ranks with Muilenburg, 51, who currently
  serves as the company's president, COO, and vice chairman.


Muilenburg will succeed 
James McNerney as
  the 10th chief executive in the company's history.


  "Dennis is an extremely capable, experienced and respected leader
  with an immense passion for our company, our people, and our
  products and services," McNerney said in a statement. 


  "As CEO, Dennis will bring a rich combination of management
  skills, customer focus, business and engineering acumen, a can-do
  spirit and the will to win."


  Muilenburg is a 30-year Boeing veteran who joined the company in
  1985 as an engineering intern and holds degrees from Iowa State
  University and the University of Washington.


  Prior to his posting as COO and president, Muilenburg also spent
  time running Boeing's Global Support and Services business as
  well as the company's Defense Space and Security division.


  Outgoing CEO, James McNerney will remain with the
  company as chairman of the board. 


  Boeing is one of the world's largest aviation and defense firms
  with revenues of over $90 billion in 2014. 


  On Tuesday, Boeing shares closed down at around $144 per share.

Boeing Names Muilenburg Chief Executive Officer
- McNerney remains board chairman; Muilenburg joins board
- Conner continues as vice chairman
- Succession rigor, timeline to aid smooth transition




CHICAGO, June 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Boeing board of directors has elected Dennis A. Muilenburg the company's 10th chief executive, succeeding W. James (Jim) McNerney, Jr., who held the position for the past 10 years. Muilenburg, who has served as Boeing president and chief operating officer since 2013, becomes president and CEO on July 1.
McNerney, who joined Boeing's board of directors in 2001, continues as its chairman. To ensure a smooth transition of his CEO responsibilities to Muilenburg, he will continue working as a company employee until retiring at the end of February 2016, and continue advocating on issues important to Boeing's U.S. and global customers, partners and stakeholders, including ongoing Washington, D.C., engagement. Kenneth M. Duberstein, Boeing's independent lead director, continues in that capacity, and Muilenburg has been elected a member of the board.
"Dennis is an extremely capable, experienced and respected leader with an immense passion for our company, our people, and our products and services," said McNerney, who made priorities of succession planning and leadership development at the outset of his tenure. "As CEO, Dennis will bring a rich combination of management skills, customer focus, business and engineering acumen, a can-do spirit and the will to win. With a deep appreciation of our past accomplishments, and the energy and skill to drive those to come, he is well suited to lead our very talented Boeing team into its second century," he added.
Muilenburg, 51, is a 30-year company veteran. Along with Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Raymond L. Conner, he also has served since 2013 as company vice chairman. Conner, 60, remains in charge of the $60 billion Commercial Airplanes unit and will serve as sole company vice chairman, where he will continue working closely with Muilenburg on key corporate processes and integrating cross-enterprise strategies and efficiencies.
"The opportunity to lead the people of Boeing in service to our commercial and government customers is a tremendous honor and responsibility," said Muilenburg. "Our company is financially strong and well positioned in our markets. As we continue to drive the benefits of integrating our enterprise skills, capabilities and experience – what we call operating as 'One Boeing' – we will find new and better ways to engage and inspire employees, deliver innovation that drives customer success, and produce results to fuel future growth and prosperity for all our stakeholders."
On behalf of the company's board of directors, Duberstein saluted both Muilenburg and McNerney. "We have high confidence in Dennis, who has distinguished his career by taking on tough challenges and delivering results," said Duberstein. "In a decade as CEO, Jim restored the vitality, focus and reputation of a storied American company, and we thank him for his extraordinary leadership and congratulate him on his success," he said.
McNerney, 65, was elected Boeing chairman, president and chief executive officer in 2005. During his tenure, the company recaptured the global lead in commercial airplane deliveries with steady increases in production and a comprehensive update of its product line; maintained a strong position in defense markets despite a downturn in U.S. military spending; restored Boeing's historic leadership in human spaceflight with major new program wins; and expanded its engineering and manufacturing footprint inside and outside the United States.
Also, with a relentless focus on internal productivity to fund investments in innovation and growth, Boeing's financial performance steadily improved under McNerney, with revenue rising 73 percent to a record $90.8 billion last year from $52.5 billion in 2004, the year before he became CEO. Backlog and earnings per share tripled over the period, also to record levels.
In his most recent role, Muilenburg shared with McNerney oversight of day-to-day business operations with a focus on the company's growth and productivity initiatives, key customer relationships and leadership-development programs. Prior to that he served since 2009 as president and CEO of Boeing Defense Space & Security, the company's $31 billion, 53,000-person business unit headquartered in St. Louis. Previously, he was president of the unit's Global Services & Support business, and before that, he led Boeing's Combat Systems division.
Muilenburg joined Boeing's engineering ranks as an intern in Seattle in 1985. He earned a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from Iowa State University and a master's in aeronautics and astronautics from the University of Washington. He held numerous program management and engineering positions of increasing responsibility early in his career, including on the company's High Speed Civil Transport, F-22, Airborne Laser and Condor reconnaissance aircraft.

Executive Biography of Dennis A. Muilenburg









Dennis A. Muilenburg
Chairman, President and Chief Executive OfficerThe Boeing Company




Dennis Muilenburg is chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of The Boeing Company.
Muilenburg, 53, oversees the strategic direction of the Chicago-based, $94.6 billion aerospace company. With roughly 150,000 employees across the United States and in more than 65 countries, Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company and top U.S. exporter. It is the leading manufacturer of commercial airplanes, military aircraft, and space and security systems, and a provider of global services; it supports airlines and U.S. and allied government customers in more than 150 nations.
Muilenburg became chairman of the board in March 2016, chief executive officer in July 2015 and president in December 2013.
Until July 2015, Muilenburg served as vice chairman, president and chief operating officer of Boeing, where he supported the company’s aerospace business operations and focused on specific growth enablers, including important global relationships, leadership initiatives and development program performance.
Before that, Muilenburg served as president and chief executive officer of Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS).
Earlier, Muilenburg was president of BDS’s Global Services & Support business, vice president and general manager of the Boeing Combat Systems division, and program manager for Future Combat Systems. Prior to that, he served as vice president of Programs & Engineering for Boeing Air Traffic Management and director of Weapon Systems for the proposed Boeing Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. He also held program management and engineering positions on F-22, Airborne Laser, High Speed Civil Transport and the Condor reconnaissance aircraft, among others.
Muilenburg, who joined Boeing in 1985, spent the first 15 years of his career in the Puget Sound region of Washington, where he held a number of program management and engineering positions in support of both the commercial airplanes and defense businesses.
Muilenburg is a member of the board of directors of Caterpillar Inc., the U.S.-China Business Council, the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation and FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science & Technology). He also is chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) board of governors and is an executive committee member of Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. companies. He also serves on the boards of trustees for the National World War II Museum and Washington University (St. Louis).
He is a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and the Royal Aeronautical Society.
A native of Iowa, Muilenburg holds a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering and an honorary doctor of science degree from Iowa State University as well as a master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics from the University of Washington.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
