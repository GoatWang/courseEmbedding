ARLINGTON, Va., June 11, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Arlington Asset Investment Corp.  (the "Company") today announced the appointment of J. Rock Tonkel, Jr. as Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") effective immediately.  Mr. Tonkel has served as the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, a member of the Company's Board of Directors and a member of the Company's Investment Committee since 2007.  He succeeds Eric F. Billings, who co-founded the Company in 1989, and is retiring after serving as CEO and co-CEO since 1997.  Mr. Billings will continue to serve as the Executive Chairman of the Board as well as the Chairman of the Company's Investment Committee.   Mr. Tonkel will also continue to serve as President of the Company, as a director for the remainder of his term and as a member of the Investment Committee. Mr. Billings stated, "It has been one of my greatest professional privileges to lead Arlington Asset and its employees.  We have capitalized on many opportunities, and faced and overcome many challenges together as well.  As I retire as CEO to focus on my other business endeavors, specifically spending more time working with my three sons at Billings Capital Management, LLC, I know the Company is in excellent hands as the Company's best days are still ahead.  I look forward to my continued involvement as Executive Chairman." Mr. Billings continued, "I would also like to congratulate Rock on his appointment as CEO.  He has been an enormous contributor to the growth and success of the Company since 1994, and I have the utmost confidence in Rock and the entire leadership team.  The Board believes that Rock's industry experience and strong leadership skills make him the ideal person to lead the Company.  We are extremely fortunate to have someone of Rock's caliber that is able to seamlessly assume the CEO role." Mr. Tonkel stated, "I sincerely thank Eric for his invaluable leadership, mentorship and continuing friendship.  I am enthusiastic about Arlington's future, and it is an honor that my fellow directors elected me as CEO to continue Eric's tradition of leadership at the Company.  I look forward to working with Eric in his role as Executive Chairman."

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
