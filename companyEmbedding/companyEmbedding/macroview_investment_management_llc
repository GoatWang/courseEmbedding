Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Company Description


MacroView Investment Management employs an absolute return investment approach in which the allocation of a client's portfolio should be based on the combination of individual risk and return requirements, current risk/reward valuations for each asset class and a solid understanding of the macroeconomic climate. The firm's investment philosophy is anchored in the following time-tested concepts of portfolio management theory along with common sense: (1) Tactical Asset Class Rotation and Diversification: (2) Top-Down Macro Analysis and (3) Comprehensive Trading Strategies. MacroView Investment may use many types of trade executions to most effectively execute their strategies. In addition to the outright purchase of securities, the firm also utilizes inverse equity strategies and long/short pairings. The accounts they manage may invest in the following types of securities: exchange-listed securities, securities traded over-the-counter, foreign issues, corporate debt securities (other than commercial paper), commercial paper, certificates of deposit, municipal securities, mutual fund shares and US government securities.

Investment Philosophy  HomeAbout Our FirmInvestment PhilosophyWhy An Investor Should Own BondsSub-AdvisoryDocumentationContact  The Advantages of Working With MacroView IndependenceMacroView is independent.  This means that our sole obligation is to our clients.  We do not have quotas or corporate partners to support.  As a fee-only investment advisor, MacroView charges a percentage based on assets under management.  We do not receive commissions for products or securities that we recommend or purchase for our clients.  This structure aligns us with our clients' interests; MacroView benefits when our clients benefit.  There are no hidden fees or up-front costs.  We strive to minimize overall transaction fees and provide personal service at a competitive rate.TransparencyClients have real-time, around-the-clock access through their custodian's web site to monitor their portfolio activity and performance.Secure CustodianshipMacroView uses a very secure and transparent custodial network to ensure our clients accounts are safe.  The majority of MacroView's clients maintain their assets in THEIR individual name in a brokerage account with Charles Schwab Institutional, a division of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (we may, on a case-by-case basis, manage client assets at a qualified custodian other than Charles Schwab).  You don't send MacroView money.  You simply give us the right to make trades in the account on your behalf.  You can see exactly what MacroView is doing anytime by accessing your account online through your custodian.

The MacroView Philosophy Achieving your financial goals requires a plan and a diversified portfolioMacroView believes that your financial goals are specific to your circumstances.  While many investors focus on stock market benchmarks, we prefer to invest in a manner that allows you to achieve your unique goals.MacroView believes diversification is essential to managing investment portfolios.  The integration of a variety of asset classes, not just investments within an asset class, is crucial to reducing risk.  The allocation of one's portfolio should be based upon the combination of individual risk and return requirements, current risk/reward valuations for each asset class, and a solid understanding of the macroeconomic climate.

13F Filings



The Security, Class, and CUSIP columns in the table below are shown exactly as filed by the investor.
        We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in
        the table as changes in names and cusips.
In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment
        is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use
            that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value.
Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently
            result in a cost basis of zero.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.
