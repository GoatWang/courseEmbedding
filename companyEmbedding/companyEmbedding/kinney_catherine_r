Steven A. Kandarian






Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer

MetLife, Inc.
Steven A. Kandarian is chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), a leading provider of insurance, annuities and employee benefit programs to approximately 100 million customers in nearly 50 markets around the world. He became president and CEO on May 1, 2011 and chairman of the board of directors on January 1, 2012. For 2016, MetLife had $63.5 billion in revenue. The company ranked 42nd on the most recent FORTUNE 500®.
Kandarian joined MetLife in April 2005 as executive vice president and chief investment officer (CIO). From 2007 to 2012, he also led MetLife’s enterprise-wide strategy, which identified key areas of focus for the company. His direction contributed to MetLife’s global expansion and led to significant cost savings as well as efforts to address the insurance needs of the underserved U.S. middle market.
As CIO, Kandarian oversaw the company’s more than $450 billion general account portfolio and led a number of initiatives that strengthened the portfolio and contributed to MetLife’s bottom line. He enhanced the company’s focus on effective risk management and diversified MetLife’s investment portfolio, in part through the $5.4 billion sale of Peter Cooper Village/Stuyvesant Town in 2006. Under Kandarian’s leadership, MetLife identified the housing bubble early and reduced its exposure to sub-prime mortgage-backed securities, raised the overall quality of its corporate credit portfolio, and increased its focus on low loan-to-value commercial and agricultural mortgages. His efforts helped MetLife emerge from the 2008 credit crisis with the financial strength to complete the company’s $16.4 billion purchase of Alico.
From 2001 to 2004, Kandarian was executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). During his tenure, he made the public case for comprehensive reform of the pension funding rules to put the defined benefit system and the PBGC on a sound financial footing, helping to lay the groundwork for the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.
Previously, Kandarian was founder and managing partner of Orion Partners, LP, a private equity firm based in the Boston area. Earlier he was managing director of Lee Capital Holdings. He began his career as an investment banker with Houston-based Rotan Mosle, Inc.
Kandarian is a board member of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, the Institute of International Finance, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Neuberger Berman and the Partnership for New York City. He is a member of the Business Council and the Business Roundtable. Kandarian earned his B.A. from Clark University, J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center, and M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.

Title: Chair of the Board of Trustees
               Company: Catholic Charities
Job Details
               Catholic Charities has been serving people of all ages and faiths for 75 years. We provide over 50 programs at 100 sites serving more than 200,000 people in Central and Northern Arizona communities. The first office was established in Phoenix in 1933 to advocate for children and help people suffering through the Great Depression. Over the years, we've expanded, adding two more regional service centers in the Phoenix area and two others in Prescott and Flagstaff to serve Yavapai, Coconino, Mohave, Navajo and Apache Counties. Catholic Charities is one of two major social service organizations of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix. The Foundation for Senior Living serves seniors and disabled people. Our mission of service is founded in Scripture, when Jesus called upon his disciples to feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, care for the sick, welcome the stranger, and minister to the imprisoned. This mission is manifest as we reach out to thousands of people-regardless of their race, ethnicity, economic status, or religious affiliation-in an effort to build just and caring communities by strengthening families, reducing poverty, alleviating suffering, and advocating for justice to enhance human dignity and ensure the social and economic participation of all. Catholic Charities is funded from a variety of sources: public and private donations; in-kind public support; the Diocese of Phoenix's Charity and Development Appeal; Valley of the Sun United Way; federal, state, and local government grants; program service fees, investment earnings, and income from sale of administrative services. Because we believe that all who need help should be able to get it, regardless of income level, program fees are calculated on a sliding fee scale based on each client's personal income. We also make accommodations for people who do not speak English. Together, our staff members speak more than 30 languages. Ultimately, our goal is provide the kind of help that creates hope and enables all people to live healthy and fulfilling lives. That's our motto--providing help, creating hope, serving all!

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
