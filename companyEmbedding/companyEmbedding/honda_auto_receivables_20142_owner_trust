	for Honda Auto Receivables 2014-4 Owner Trust. In the ordinary course of business, Citibank is involved in a number of legal proceedings,
	including in connection with its role as trustee of certain RMBS transactions. One such proceeding was a civil action filed against
	Citibank in the Supreme Court of the State of New York on June 18, 2014 by a group of investors in 48 private-label RMBS trusts
	for which Citibank serves or did serve as trustee, asserting claims for alleged violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
	breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on Citibank's alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee
	for the 48 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw this action. On the same day, a smaller subset
	of similar plaintiff investors in 27 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank serves or did serve as trustee, filed a new civil
	action against Citibank in the Southern District of New York asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in state court.
	In January 2015, the court closed plaintiffs' original state court action. Citibank's motion to dismiss the federal complaint was
	fully briefed as of May 13, 2015. On September 8, 2015, the federal court dismissed all claims as to 24 of the 27 trusts and allowed
	certain of the claims to proceed as to the other three trusts. That case, involving the three remaining trusts, is pending.


	 


	On November 24, 2015, the same investors that brought the federal
	case brought a new civil action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York related to 25 private-label RMBS trusts for which
	Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee. This case includes the 24 trusts previously dismissed in the federal action,
	and one additional trust. The investors assert claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid
	conflicts of interest, and violation of New York's Streit Act.


	 


	On August 19, 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
	as Receiver for a financial institution filed a civil action against Citibank in the Southern District of New York. This action
	relates to one private-label RMBS trust for which Citibank formerly served as trustee. FDIC asserts claims for breach of contract,
	violation of the Streit Act, and violation of the Trust Indenture Act. Citibank is jointly briefing a motion to dismiss with two
	other banks, entities that have also been sued by FDIC in their capacity as trustee, and whose cases are all in front of Judge
	Carter.


	 


	There can be no assurances as to the outcome of litigation or the
	possible impact of litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Citibank denies liability and intends to vigorously defend
	against the litigation. Furthermore, neither the above-disclosed litigation nor any other pending legal proceeding involving Citibank
	will materially affect Citibank's ability to perform its duties as Indenture Trustee under the Indentures for the ABS transactions.

Conduct of Business .

 

(a)           Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement and any provision of law that
otherwise so empowers the Company, the Company shall not, without
10 days notice to each Rating Agency, during which time no Rating

would result in the qualification, reduction or withdrawal of the
ratings it has currently assigned to any outstanding Securities, do
any of the following;

 

(i)          create,
incur or assume any indebtedness or issue any security or sell or
transfer any receivables (including the Receivables) to a Trust or

to have agreed that the debt, liabilities and obligations incurred,
contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to such
indebtedness shall be enforceable against the assets securing or
collateralizing such indebtedness or security only, and not against
the assets of the Company generally or against any other assets
securing or collateralizing any other indebtedness or security of
the Company, and (B) agree or are deemed to have agreed that to the
extent such debt holders are deemed to have any interest in the
assets the Company generally or any other assets collateralizing or
securing any other indebtedness or security of the Company, their
interest in those assets will be subordinate to claims or rights of
such other debt holders to those assets and, further, that such
agreement will constitute a subordination agreement for purposes of
510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code;

 

(ii)         so
long as any outstanding debt of the Company or Securities are rated

Securities, or (B) such notes or borrowings are fully subordinated
(and which shall provide for payment only after payment in respect
of all outstanding rated debt and/or Securities), provided,
however, that with respect to both (A) and (B) the Company shall
not issue notes or otherwise borrow money unless such notes or
borrowings are (i) nonrecourse against any assets of the Company
other than the assets pledged to secure such notes or

borrowings and (ii) does not
constitute a claim against the Company if cash flow from the assets
securing or collateralizing such indebtedness or security is
insufficient to repay the debt, and in the event such indebtedness
or security is deemed to constitute a claim against the Company
generally or against any other assets securing or collateralizing
any other indebtedness or security of the Company, such claim shall
be subordinate to the claims of such other indebtedness or security
to which those assets relates;

 

(iii)        become
or remain liable, directly or contingently, in connection with any
indebtedness or other liability of any other Person, whether by
guarantee, endorsement (other than endorsements of negotiable

than the Company) formed as a result of or surviving such
consolidation or merger, or which acquires the properties and
assets of the Company expressly assumes all of the Company’s
obligations under the Basic Documents and (iii) is governed under a
charter document containing provisions substantially identical to
the provisions of 3.02 and 4.01 of this Agreement; (B) the Rating
Agencies under the Basic Documents shall have received at least 10
days prior notice of any such merger, consolidation or sale of the
assets during which time no Ratings Agency shall have notified the
Company that such action might or would result in the
qualification, reduction or withdrawal of the ratings it has
currently assigned to any outstanding Securities (C) such merger,
consolidation or sale of assets will not conflict with any
provisions of the Certificate of Formation; and (D) immediately
after giving effect to such merger, consolidation or sale of
assets, no default or event of default by or relating to the
Company shall have occurred and be continuing under any material
agreement to which the Company is a party;

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
