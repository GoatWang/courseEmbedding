Intelligent Workflow Automation Solutions for HealthcareDo more, print less and increase patient satisfaction with Auxilio’s iPLATFORM, a workflow automation suite of intuitive, intelligent and integrative solutions for document management and business processes in healthcare. These smart workflow solutions connect your patient and physician 3rd party systems while transforming cumbersome paper processes to digital information. It’s changing the way hospitals do business.

What iPLATFORM does for patient administration in hospitals:
iPLATFORM consists of configurable modules – all that can easily integrate with your hospital’s existing applications, helping automate your operations cycle – from orders and registration to patient tracking and financial clearance. This can be done without the cost or inconvenience associated with a complete system replacement.

iPLATFORM  streamlines interdepartmental workflow by centralizing the flow of patient data.  It brings together all critical patient and physician information from separate systems and combines it into a single, electronic patient folder that can be viewed throughout your facility.  iPLATFROM’s powerful modules eliminate paper documents and automate information exchange, which gives users a comprehensive, electronic snapshot of current patient status.
The iPLATFORM automation solution will help you reach your goals by immediately identifying inefficiencies and triggering corrective actions ― all based on your, facility-defined standards.
 Focus on patient care – not patient administration.
