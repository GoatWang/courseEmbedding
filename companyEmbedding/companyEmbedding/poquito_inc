The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Comfortable to use (11/06/2015)


This is a very nice drip tip, in terms of form factor and design.It has a snug fit, and is very comfortable to use.The colours come up well too, as they give off different shades, according to how much light passes through it.It is ideal for those times where adding a little colour to your set up, makes all the difference.














Very good (23/01/2015)


Spot on and looks good to ;)














love this! (12/12/2014)


was looking for a very short drip tip whilst still having quite a wide opening and this fits the bill perfectly. Nice tight fit on my aerotank mega and the red tip perfectly matches my red Pyrex and really finishes off the look on my provari mini zombie edition 2. My setup is now very pocket friendly.Can't comment on the other review about it being brittle but if you drop any kind of setup then something on it could easily break so Just don't go dropping things!
