Whole Foods Market® Names Angela Lorenzen Pacific Northwest Regional President
25-year natural foods veteran to oversee stores in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia
Share:
BELLVUE, Wash., (Sept. 26, 2016) – Whole Foods Market is pleased to announce that Angela Lorenzen has been named Regional President of the company’s Pacific Northwest region.
Lorenzen will oversee 22 stores in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, including two stores opening in Eugene, Ore. and Victoria, B.C. in September and November, respectively.
"I’m thrilled to lead our team in the Pacific Northwest region,” said Lorenzen. “This community cares deeply about natural and organic food and the story behind what’s on their plate. I’m focused on empowering our Team Members to meet the needs of this unique community and providing shoppers with the great experience they expect from Whole Foods Market.”
Previously, Lorenzen served Whole Foods Market’s Northern California region in various leadership roles including vice president and executive coordinator of Operations. She’s worked in five of the company’s California stores, including the Noe Valley store where she led the store’s opening.
“Angela is a results-driven leader with vast operational experience that has made her an incredible asset to Whole Foods Market,” said David Lannon, executive vice president of Operations at Whole Foods Market. “We’re thrilled to see her take on this role and continue to grow our business in the Pacific Northwest region.”

As much security as we seek and as much freedom as we need…
It sounds perfect, doesn’t it?
The question is, how can we achieve this?



  

The im-pudency between intimacy and desire.
Sexuality is dealt with rather inconsistently in our society. On the one hand, sex is probably available more easily than ever before, but …



  

Recognising the origin.
Female sexuality is a world unto itself and more and more women
are rediscovering it in all its power and beauty.



  
From hot or cold war to a good agreement. For both partners.
The conflict in your relationship might be so serious that you no longer feel like you’re making any progress. You might even be arguing openly…


  
No more taboo, just relief or a solution
You might want more than just coaching, you might be facing a particular challenge with your sexuality or with intimacy with your partner…


  
Clearing blocks. Finding sensuality and energy.
Psychosexual Somatics® Therapy is a process of body psychotherapy. It allows us to explore our limits and boundaries, desires and needs in a safe space.
