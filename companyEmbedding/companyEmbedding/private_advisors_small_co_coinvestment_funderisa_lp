Equity Co-Investment









Share








































DEFINITION of 'Equity Co-Investment'
A minority investment made by investors in a company alongside a private equity fund manager or venture capital firm. Equity co-investment enables investors to get in on potentially very profitable investments without paying the usual fees charged by the private equity fund. Equity co-investment opportunities are generally restricted to large institutional investors who already have existing relationships with the private equity fund manager, and are typically not available to retail investors.
 

BREAKING DOWN 'Equity Co-Investment'
 
Why would a private equity fund manager give away a lucrative opportunity? Private equity is usually invested through a limited partnership (LP) vehicle in a portfolio of companies. In certain situations, the LP's funds may already be fully committed to  a number of companies, which means that if another prime opportunity turns up, the private equity fund manager may either have to pass up the opportunity or offer it to some investors as an equity co-investment.  
Most limited partners pay a 2% management fee and 20% carried interest to the fund manager who is the general partner. However, co-investors may benefit from lower fees or no fees in some cases, which would boost returns available to them.
A 2013 study showed that investor appetite for co-investment opportunities was at an all-time high. The survey of 140 limited partners showed that 73% had co-invested in at least one past portfolio company deal, while more than 75% reported they were looking for co-investment opportunities.

PRESS RELEASE
RICHMOND, VA, July 25, 2017 – Private Advisors, LLC, a leading alternative investment firm, has closed its oversubscribed seventh small company private equity fund (“Fund VII”) at a hard cap of $350 million.
Fund VII focuses exclusively on the small company market in North America where Private Advisors has been a leading investor for more than 20 years. The Fund primarily invests in lower-middle market buyout, growth and distressed private equity funds (typically less than $750 million in size), along with targeted equity co-investments and opportunistic secondary investments.
“We are grateful to our limited partners for their continued support as almost 70 percent of the Fund came from existing investors. We are also very excited to gain many new investors and further expand our LP base outside the U.S.,” said Chris Stringer, President of Private Advisors.
The Fund’s investor base primarily includes institutional investors such as pension plans, foundations, endowments, insurance, and family offices. Private Advisors’ employees and its parent organization, New York Life Insurance Company, made meaningful commitments, underscoring a strong alignment of interests with investors. 





Todd Milligan, Partner on the Private Equity team, commented: “We are pleased to have already committed over 50 percent of the Fund to high quality and access constrained investments, and we continue to see compelling opportunities ahead. We believe our broad investment platform and longstanding dedication to the small company market provide distinct sourcing, relationship and diligence advantages for our partners.”
