G2 Mission Statement






















G2 (\jē-ˈtü-\) n. proprietary intelligence
Who are we?• Investment company that creates partnerships with asset operators rather than fund managers.• Provide appropriate architecture and strategic capital to our operating partners.• Align incentives and interests with operators to promote long term partnerships.• Focus on enterprise value and tax deferral benefits that accrue to companies.• Invest in assets of need such as real estate and energy, which have infinite duration and asymmetrical return.• Apply the teachings of Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway to assets that should be owned for decades.
We believe that fundamental outperformance can only occur in one of three ways:1) Hyper growth industries - innovation2) Mispriced assets3) Creating better financial architecture “Structural Alpha”
The end result is that G2 is a collection of operators who invest across a diverse set of assets of need. We receive equity in each company that we invest in or create, which enables us to offer co-investments to our shareholding partners.

Buffett’s Grandson Seeks Own Investment Route: Social Change

At 32, Howard Warren Buffett, the grandson of the Berkshire Hathaway founder Warren E. Buffett, has already enjoyed a diverse career.
He teaches at Columbia University, runs a farm in Nebraska, previously oversaw his family’s foundation and worked on economic redevelopment efforts in Afghanistan for the Defense Department.So far, however, he has steered clear of the private sector investing that made his family’s famous name and enormous fortune.
Now, that is changing. Mr. Buffett has co-founded a permanently capitalized operating company with big ambitions — essentially mimicking the structure of Berkshire Hathaway, the $328 billion conglomerate that owns everything from railways to candy makers.

Historic PacMutual building in downtown L.A. is sold for $200 million


 
The historic PacMutual center was sold for $200 million on Wednesday, capping a profitable turnaround for what was once a second-tier office complex in downtown Los Angeles.
Rising Realty Partners made over the Beaux Arts-style building from a lower-rent alternative for conventional white-collar firms into a preferred address for businesses in creative fields such as technology and entertainment. It acquired the property at 6th and Olive streets for $60 million in 2012.
The Los Angeles developer exposed the century-old bones of the building by removing "improvements" made in the decades after World War II. Drywall, dropped ceilings and carpet were yanked out to reveal brick walls, concrete floors and even some windows that had been co...Read more

Financial Times: Buffett inspires G2’s direct investments

It was doing the maths on Warren Buffett that made Todd Morley believe traditional private equity funds and hedge funds might be in trouble.
Mr Morley, the well-connected co-founder of investment group Guggenheim Partners, has been building up his new venture, G2 Investment Group, in recent months with partnership deals in Californian real estate and Canadian oil and gas – based on the theory that sophisticated investors want direct ownership stakes in these assets rather than pooling their money in high-fee funds.
On the heels of a tie-up with the Los Angeles property developer Nelson Rising, G2 has begun investing with Canadian oil and gas financier Rick Grafton to take advantage of what they say are wildly underpriced energy ass...Read more

Milken Institute Conference: Rick Grafton on Milken Institute Conference “Energy Infrastructure: Getting New Supply to Market Faster

G2 partner Rick Grafton, CEO of Grafton Asset Management, featured at the 2013 Milken Institute Global Conference on the panel “Energy Infrastructure: Getting New Supply to Market Faster”.
 




Unconventional oil and gas deposits, as well as solar parks and wind farms, are making sizable contributions to the U.S. energy supply. However, these new sources may be located far from demand centers, and the transport infrastructure may be insufficient to get them there.
