(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our audited annual financial statements and the related notes thereto, each of which appear elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as described under the heading "About Forward-Looking Statements" in this Report on Form 10-K. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties, please see the disclosure under the heading "Risk Factors" elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. The Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below is based upon only the financial performance of QPAGOS.  Overview and Financial Condition  We are a provider of next generation physical and virtual payment services that we introduced to the Mexican market in the third quarter of 2014. We have a ten-year renewable exclusive license agreement for the use of technology that can be used to perform services that are similar to services that have been successfully deployed with this technology in several European, Asian, North and South American countries.  We provide an integrated network of kiosks, terminals and payment channels that enable consumers to deposit cash, convert it into a digital form and remit the funds to any merchant in our network quickly and securely. We help consumers and merchants connect more efficiently in markets and consumer segments, such as Mexico, that are largely cash-based and lack convenient alternatives for consumers to pay for goods and services in physical, online and mobile environments. For example, we license technology that can be used to pay bills, add minutes to mobile phones, purchase transportation tickets, shop online, buy digital services or send money to third parties.  Our current focus is on Mexico which remains a cash-dominated society for retail consumer payments with approximately 80% of the value of personal payments exchanged in cash (Bank of Mexico). The penetration of electronic payment services, such as credit and debit cards and point of sale terminals, significantly lags behind more developed economies. We believe that opportunities for our services in Mexico are vast. With over 109 million mobile subscribers in Mexico, 85% of which are under prepaid plans, mobile top-up alone, was a $12 billion business in 2014 as reported by PwC Telecom in Mexico 2015, America M�vil 4Q 2015. We believe that there is opportunity for growth in the Mexican market and has expanded to service providers beyond the mobile telephone operators to service provides of electricity, transportation, utilities, municipal services and taxes, consumer credit installments, insurance premiums, and many more. Altogether as of the first quarter of 2016 our platform had integrated 110 such services.  Our primary strategy in Mexico to date has been the attraction of service providers as well as the deployment of kiosks through Redpag Electr�nicos, our kiosk management subsidiary. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated net revenues of $2,691,896 and $1,127,944, respectively, from our operations in Mexico, a 138.7% increase. Our primary source of revenue are fees we receive for processing payments made by consumers to service providers. We also generate revenue from non-payment services such as kiosk sales. Qpagos Corporation currently has in excess of 140 service providers integrated into its payment gateway, which includes all mobile phone providers in Mexico as well as most utility companies, financial services, entertainment venues and others. As of December 31, 2016, Qpagos Corporation deployed over 272 kiosks and terminals and we service an additional 440 kiosks of independent distributors. Our kiosks and terminals can be found at convenience stores, next to metro stations, retail stores, airport terminals, education centers, and malls in major urban centers, as well as many small and rural towns.  Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, of QPAGOS, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions. The estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Results of Operations for the years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015  Net revenues in Qpagos Corporation were $2,691,896 and $1,127,944 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively, an increase of $1,563,952 or 138.7%. Qpagos Corporation operates in Mexico and its functional currency is the Mexican Peso. Qpagos Corporation's revenue in Mexican Pesos increased to MXN 50,308,314 from MXN 17,897,671 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of MXN 32,410,643 or 181.1%. The increase in revenue in MXN terms is primarily due to an increase in the volume of prepaid airtime sold, directly attributable to the increased deployment of kiosks during the current year, and we also increased the number of our customers over the prior year. The average US$ exchange rate has strengthened against the MXN over the prior year, from $15.867526 to $18.6692 or 17.7%, which results in a lower revenue growth in US $ terms of $475,299.  Cost of goods sold  Cost of goods sold in Qpagos Corporation was $2,595,012 and $1,155,732 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $1,439,280 or 124.5%.

The increase in cost of sales in MXN terms is primarily due to the increase in the volume of prepaid airtime sold which is directly attributable to the increased deployment of kiosks and its wholesale business during the current year. Cost of goods consists primarily of services acquired from third parties, such as prepaid air time and the cost of the kiosks and any retrofitted components. Also included in cost of sales is depreciation related to those kiosks that are used in the production of income. Depreciation expenses was $37,244 and $35,496, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $1,748. The average US $ exchange rate has strengthened against the MXN over the prior year, from $15.867526 to $18.6692 or 17.7%, which results in a lower cost of sales in US $ terms of $459,908.  Gross profit  Gross profit (loss) was $96,885 and $(27,788) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $124,673 or 448.7%. Qpagos Corporations operates in Mexico and our functional currency is the Mexican Peso. The components of gross profit are as follows:  � Gross profit (loss) on sales of services increased from a gross profit of $29,739 to a gross profit of $54,749, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $25,010. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to increase in volume of transactions.  � Gross (loss) profit on kiosk sales increased from a gross loss of ($48,670) to a gross profit of $80,858 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $129,528. The net change from gross loss to gross profit of $51,473 is primarily attributable to a once off charge, in the prior year, for retrofitting the cash and coin acceptors and printers into our existing kiosks, discussed under cost of sales above.  � Gross (loss) profit other decreased from $26,639 to ($1,479) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $28,118. The decrease is due to a reduction of commission earned due to the termination of a commission agreement we had with one of our vendors and an increase in ad-hoc maintenance expenditures incurred on operating kiosks.  � Included in gross (loss) profit is depreciation related to those kiosks that are used in the production of income. Depreciation expenses was $37,244 and $35,496, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $1,748.  Total expenses  Total expenses in Qpagos Corporation were $4,380,182 and $2,812,927 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $1,567,255 or 55.7%. Qpagos operates in Mexico and our functional currency is the Mexican Peso. The average US $ exchange rate has strengthened against the MXN over the prior year, from $15.867526 to 18.6692 or 17.7%, which results in a lower total expense of approximately $775,113 in US $ terms.  Total expenses consisted primarily of the following:  a. General and administrative expenditure was $4,312,107 and $2,780,576 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $1,531,531 or 55.1%. Qpagos Corporation has operations in Mexico and a US holding company presence which incurs some expenditure.  i. The general and administrative expenditure in Mexico increased to MXN 22,731,911 from MXN 22,559,541 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of MXN 172,370 or 0.8%. The increase is primarily due to increase in payroll cost due to normal pay increases and a small net increase in personnel.  ii. The general administrative expenses incurred by Qpagos Corporation in the US, during the 2016 year, amounted to US$3,084,747, which primarily consists of stock based compensation charges of $144,000 and a non-cash issue of shares for services amounting to $2,032,275 related to share based consulting agreements entered into with management consultants; consulting fees paid to IT consultants and management consultants of $557,358 and general corporate legal expenditure of $229,514 due to the amount of legal activity involved in entering into the reverse merger agreements with the Mexican operations and preparation of private placement memorandum for the fund raising completed during the current year; and audit fees of $90,000.  The general administrative expenses incurred by Qpagos Corporation in the US, during the 2015 year, amounted to US$1,275,724,, which primarily consists of stock based compensation charges of $288,000 and a non-cash issue of shares for services amounting to $658,577 related to share based consulting agreements entered into with management consultants; consulting fees paid to IT consultants and management consultants of $178,843 and general corporate legal expenditure of $178,843 due to the amount of legal activity involved in setting up the corporation; entering into the various reverse merger agreements with the Mexican operations and preparation of private placement memorandum for the fund raising completed during 2015.  Other income  Other income of Qpagos Corporation was $788 and $203 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Interest expense, net  Interest expense of $54,611 in 2016 consists of interest on loans to various investors at interest rates of 6% and 10% per annum, interest on a revolving credit line with our CEO earning interest at 6% per annum and default interest of $36,000 related to the loan due to YP Holdings LLC.  Foreign currency loss  The foreign currency loss in Qpagos Corporation was $357,855 and $466,920 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $109,065. The decrease is primarily due the reduction of liabilities in 2015 which are denominated in US $ that were part of a debt for stock exchange in August 2015. There are also significant intercompany balances between the US holding company and the Mexican subsidiaries which arose during the 2016 year, as funds raised in the US were invested in the Mexican operations, these intercompany balances result in a decreased foreign exchange loss. The average US $ exchange rate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $18.6692 and $15.867526, respectively, a strengthening of 17.7%, the rate of exchange as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $20.6640 and $17.373473, respectively, a strengthening of 18.9%.  Change in fair value of derivative  The current year includes a charge of $36,074 representing the mark-to-market of the derivative liability associated with the convertible promissory note in the amount of $77,000 issued on December 28, 2106.  Net loss  We incurred a net loss of $4,731,049 and $3,309,673, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $1,421,376 or approximately 42.9%, and which consist of the various items discussed above.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  To date, our primary sources of cash have been funds raised from the sale of its securities and the issuance of debt as well as revenue derived from operations.  We incurred an accumulated deficit of $8,757,197 through December 31, 2016 and incurred negative cash flow from operations of $1,929,453 and $2,675,448 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have spent, and need to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development effort and will be required to raise additional funding.  At December 31, 2016, we had cash of $46,286 and a working capital deficit of $195,753. We believe that the current cash balances together with revenue anticipated to be generated from operations will not be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs and as mentioned above, we will seek further funding from either equity issues or further debt funding, should we not be successful, we may have to curtail our operations significantly.  During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Qpagos Corporation raised gross proceeds of $375,000 and $2,990,000 from the issuance of 500,000 common shares at a price of $0.75 and 4,784,000 (2,392,000 pre-merger) common units at a price of $0.625 ($1.25 pre-merger) per unit, each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to acquire a share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.625 ($1.25 pre-merger) per share, the total share issue expenses incurred in this private placement amounts to $388,700, realizing net proceeds of $2,601,300, respectively. Qpagos Corporation also issued debt securities in the principal amount $77,000 and $685,001 to private investors during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to fund the operations of the business through its development stage. The majority of the loans raised in 2015 together with loan funds raised in 2014 of $2,324,422 were exchanged for common shares in Qpagos Corporation upon consummation of the reverse merger between the newly formed US corporation and the two Mexican operating companies, Redpag Electr�nicos S.A.P.I. de C.V. and QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (the Mexican operating company), these shares were subsequently exchanged for shares in QPAGOS upon consummation of the Reverse Merger which took place on May 12, 2016. Included in the $685,001 is a debt security of $100,000, which was not converted to equity and is expected to be repaid within the next twelve months.  Subsequent to December 31, 2016 we raised the following funds:  � An additional $95,000 was raised through a related party.  We utilized cash of $1,929,453, and $2,675,448 in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We had an investment in property and equipment of $453 and $4,779 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. In 2015 the Company capitalized company owned kiosks which were used to generate revenues for its own account.  We funded our operations by utilizing our cash balances and raising an additional $375,000 and $2,990,000 by the issue of common stock to certain investors in a private placement, additional loans raised of $370,000 and $685,001 and an additional $77,000 and $0 in convertible debt , for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We have minimal commitments which include a lease of an office facility with a future commitment of $34,152 in each of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019.  We entered into an additional ten-year licensing agreement with the Licensor on May 1, 2015, whereby we are committed to pay an annual license fee in quarterly installments of $5,000 ($20,000 per annum) to the Licensor for an exclusive license for the Mexican market of certain revenue payment services.  Our primary financial commitments as of the date hereof are payments owed commitments due under the license agreement is summarized as follows:   Amount 2017 $ 20,100 2018 20,100 2019 20,100 2020 and thereafter 107,167 $ 167,467  Capital Expenditures  None.  Critical Accounting Policies  a) Use of Estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments. In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.  Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.  b) Contingencies  Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.  If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in our consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.  c) Fair Value of Financial Instruments  We adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.  Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.  The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, other current assets, other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and notes payable, approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments. The Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance.  ASC 825-10 "Financial Instruments" allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. We did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.  d) Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded. We have a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors, including the period they have been outstanding. Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful accounts. In addition, we regularly assesses the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues, which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates. Revisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense. Receivables deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off. Recoveries of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts. There were no recoveries during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.  e) Inventory  We primarily values inventories at the lower of cost or market applied on a first-in, first-out basis. We identify and write down our excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value based on usage forecasts, order volume and inventory aging. With the development of new products, we also rationalizes our product offerings and will write-down discontinued product to the lower of cost or net realizable value.  f) Intangibles  All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. Where intangibles are deemed to be impaired we recognize an impairment loss measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the intangible and its book value.  g) License Agreements  License agreements acquired by us are reported at acquisition value less accumulated amortization and impairments.  Amortization  Amortization is reported in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets, unless the useful life is indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of the license agreement is five years which is the expected period for which we expect to derive a benefit from the underlying license agreements.  h) Long-Term Assets  Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.  i) Revenue Recognition  Our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605). In general, our records revenue when it is realized, or realizable and earned. We consider revenue to be realized, or realizable and earned when, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the products or services have been approved by the customer after delivery and/or installation acceptance or performance of services; the sales price is fixed or determinable within the contract; and collectability is reasonably assured.  We have the following sources of revenue which is recognized on the basis described below.  � Revenue from the sale of services.  Prepaid services are acquired from providers and is sold to end-users through kiosks that we own or kiosks that are owned by third parties. We recognize the revenue on the sale of these services when the end-user deposits funds into the terminal and the prepaid service is delivered to the end-user. The revenue is recognized at the gross value, including margin, of the prepaid service to us, net of any value-added tax which is collected on behalf of the Mexican Revenue Authorities.  � Payment processing provided to end-users  We provide a secure means for end-users to pay for certain services, such as utilities through our kiosks. We earn either a fixed per-transaction fee or a fixed percentage of the service sold. We act as a collection agent and recognize the payment processing fee, net of any value-added taxes collected on behalf of the Mexican Revenue Authorities, when the funds are deposited into the kiosk and the customer has settled his liability or has acquired a prepaid service.  � Revenue from the sale of kiosks.  We import, assemble and sell kiosks that are used to generate the revenues discussed above. Revenue is recognized on the full value of the kiosks sold, net of any valued added taxation collected on behalf of the Mexican Revenue Authorities, when the customer takes delivery of the kiosk and all the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the customer.  We do not enter into any leasing of kiosks arrangements with customers and we do not generate any revenues from merchants who access our terminals as yet.  j) Share-Based Payment Arrangements  Generally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on the awards' grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Share-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is . . .
