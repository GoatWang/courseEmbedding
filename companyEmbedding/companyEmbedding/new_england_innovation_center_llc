    New England Innovation Center, LLC (NEIC) is a Delaware series limited liability company formed to advance a new business accelerator model focused on identifying or creating and assisting sustainable, high-growth technology companies in New Hampshire and throughout New England. 
 


 About the Center


        A team of respected New England technology entrepreneurs, led by Mark Galvin, have launched a new startup business accelerator model - the New England Innovation Center. The Center’s mission is to create and/or drive the equity value of a highly competitive selection of early stage companies from throughout New England. Selected companies are generally expected to move into the NEIC facility and receive a combination of business resources and “hands-on involvement” by the Center’s seasoned startup executive staff.
    

        Between May 1, 2013 and April 30, 2018, the NEIC expects to select, from a highly competitive group, approximately 15 seed stage technology companies and seek to “graduate” them normally within 24 months of entry with the intention that they can stay on their feet, will remain local, grow rapidly and eventually provide liquidity to the Center.  Each selected company enters into separate agreements with the NEIC pursuant to which that company grants some "founder" equity to the NEIC for the services and facilities provided to it by the Center.
    

        Companies who agree to move into the Center are eligible to use the seasoned NEIC startup staff to complete key assignments, leveraging the staff’s expertise in go-to-market strategy, market analysis, marketing communications, sales, channels, operations, finance and human resources at no additional cost, thereby seeking to limit burn rates. In addition, these companies share a high-energy environment and business resources such as office space, meeting areas, communications’ systems and operations management.
    

        The 3,500 square foot facility, located at 99 Bow Street in downtown Portsmouth, New Hampshire is set up in an open collaborative environment with individual desks, lab space, break room, and conference areas.  The facility can be the home to as many as six early stage companies at a time.

Businesses are benefiting from MyMedicalShopper in a number of important ways: providing the MMS app to their employees as a new benefit; reducing health insurance premiums as a direct result of reducing their total medical claims; and saving the time, money, and frustration associated with administering health savings accounts (HSAs), health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), and flexible spending accounts (FSAs) through MyMedicalShopper’s robust employer dashboard.

 Vera Roasting Company

Visit Site View Press 


                Professor Glen Miller founded the Vera Roasting Company, Inc. in September 2015 with the mission to roast and sell healthier coffee. The company has patents filed for its proprietary method to bring all the “heart healthy” aspects of drinking a glass of red wine to every cup of coffee. CoffVeeTM is made from delicately roasted, 100% Arabica beans infused with resveratrol, the all-natural antioxidant found in the skin of red grapes. Vera’s delicious brew is the only coffee roasted for heart health. 
            

                Resveratrol is structurally related to flavonoid antioxidants which are abundant in “the healthiest foods,” such as onions, parsley, blueberries, grapefruit, garbanzo beans, almonds, cabbage, turnip greens, quinoa, sweet potatoes, etc. Most importantly, resveratrol is safe. People have been consuming red wines, and resveratrol, for thousands of years. Vera’s process of infusing resveratrol into coffee beans during the roasting process brings meaningful health benefits without affecting the taste, color, or aroma of its premium coffee.
            

                Vera Roasting Company announced the launch of CoffVee in December 2015, and within two weeks had seen stories of its industry-changing innovation broadcast across media outlets all over the world, including The New York Times, Huffington Post, Fox News, The Boston Globe, WMUR, WBZ, Brit.co, Eater.com, Spoon, The Seattle Times, The Sacramento Bee, The Washington Post, and hundreds of others. Vera had received orders to ship to consumers in all 50 states within the first week, and in the first month the company had already built relationships to supply CoffVee to a number of commercial customers, including major professional sports teams.
            






 Leveraged Developments, Inc.
www.ivbreeze.com
Visit Site View Press 


                In May 2010, the FDA issued new guidelines for the approval of intravenous infusion pumps... and for good reason.  The pumping mechanism in use in conventional pumps is decades old, in its design, and may not reliably detect conditions in which the patient is not getting the prescribed dosage.  Product recalls and reports of performance failures are commonplace.
            

                Leveraged Developments targeted their design directly at the Safety Assurance Case analyses now required by the FDA and has developed Breeze™, a simple fluid flow control module that can be incorporated within finished medical products, such as intravenous infusion pumps, enteral feeding devices, and patient monitoring systems.  These components can be readily incorporated into an overall safe and effective pump design.  It operates using gentle pneumatics… just a breeze of air does all of the work.
            

                The primary goals of the company’s design include mitigation of the 58 hazards identified by the FDA for conventional IV pumps, reduce workflow interruptions caused by nuisance alarms, elimination of common errors associated with configuring "secondary" infusions such as antibiotics, creation of a pump surface that is easy to disinfect and to reduce costs to acquire and support IV pumps.
            

                Breeze is sold on an Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) basis to companies that market medical devices.   Leveraged Developments will not make or sell the finished medical devices and is not required to obtain ay FDA approvals, although their customers will need to file their own regulatory submissions for products that use the Breeze platform.  The company provides test data, reliability data, FMEA results, and other documentation to facilitate the approval process.
            

                Companies already in the infusion pump or enteral feeder market may benefit by replacing their complex electromechanical pumping mechanisms with the simplicity of Breeze, taking advantage of its improved reliability.
            

                Companies marketing patient monitors may benefit by using a reliable and simple platform for infusions and feeding to create closed loop systems for maintaining glucose, blood pressure, analgesic levels, hydration, or nutrition.
            

                Jeffrey Carlisle who was named “Disruptivator to Watch” in 2012 founded the company in 2011.  Mr. Carlisle has a rich history of innovation in medical products throughout a career spanning over 35 years including management positions at HP Medical Products, DEKA Research and Fluidsense.
            

                The Center has an arrangement such that it will receive royalty payments against shipped products using Leveraged Development’s Breeze technology until we have received 10x our invested services valued originally at fair market value (FMV).           
            






 MEDUS Health

Visit Site View Press 


                MEDUS Health was founded by Richard Furber in 2015, driven by his desire to create a revolutionary new kind of health plan, with a primary focus on Insuring Wellness.
            

                Our current health insurance model was born in the 1970s. While we have seen some changes over the past 40 years, the system's original architects could have never imagined the world we live in today. And that's why our healthcare system is so outdated, complicated, inefficient, and expensive. At MEDUS Health, we've invented a totally different health plan for a totally different world.     
            

                Patient-centered care supports active involvement of patients and their families in decision-making about individual options for treatment. We’re focused on providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions. Patient-centered care is also one of the overreaching goals of health advocacy. The 5 constituent dimensions of patient engagement include: communication, provider effectiveness, alignment of objective, information & encouragement, and patient incentive.
            

                Our mission is to redefine health as a long-term asset. MEDUS will lead a revolution by providing early intervention and care coordination for members, helping them to make behavioral and lifestyle decisions to achieve optimal health. Targeting both healthy individuals and those who are at risk of developing a chronic condition, MEDUS’s programs help members achieve healthier lifestyle behaviors through a wellness portal, biometric testing, and lifestyle coaching.
