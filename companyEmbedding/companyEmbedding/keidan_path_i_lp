Limited to 666 Copies Worldwide. Clear Purple with solid black colour in colour 180g vinyl, housed inside a 425gsm spot varnish sleeve. Includes a download code. Pentagram Home Video return with their somophore record for Death Waltz Originals. Continuing the (satanic) path carved out on their debut LP ‘Who’s Out There’ Broody analog electronics weave in between a thumping kick drum and snares that can snap a back at 50 paces. What Pentagram does with the 80’s infused synth template is give it space to breathe. His music is as much about what’s happening inbetween the bass stabs as the actual melodies themselves which gives his music an other worldly feel, the only person you could even mildly compare him too is Pye Corner Audio. In a world full of retro synth merchants PHV stand out because there is no hint of cheesy 80’s revisionism here, the music is dark, forboding and very eerie indeed.Artwork & Layout by We Buy Your Kids.

Cutter path simulation and product visualization using AutoCAD
Authors


            Huang, Samuel H.; Bhura, Kapil R.; Wang, Ge
            

Abstract


                In this paper, a software tool for NC (numerical control) cutter path simulation and product visualization, 3D‐Sim, is presented. 3D‐Sim utilizes a commercial computer‐aided design (CAD) software tool, AutoCAD, to perform virtual NC verification. An NC program is interpreted and transformed into an AutoLISP program, which once loaded in AutoCAD allows the user to visualize the virtual machining operations and obtain a 3D solid model of the final part. Incorporating NC verification capability into CAD software tools not only reduces software cost but also shortens user training time. The resulting 3D solid model allows the user to visualize the final product as well as perform more detailed analysis such as measuring the dimensions. 3D‐Sim has been used in the senior/graduate level computer‐aided manufacturing (CAM) course and was well‐received by the student. This work is part of a long‐term research effort to establish an integrated manufacturing environment where students can receive rigorous training and gain hands‐on experience in collaborative manufacturing through the use of integrated computerized systems. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Comput Appl Eng Educ 8:113±126, 2000Keywords: CAD/CAM; numerical control cutter path; simulation; product visualization; solidmodelINTRODUCTIONTechnical BackgroundNowadays, NC machines are commonly used inmodern manufacturing environment to produce parts.However, programs used by NC machines are noterror free, and have to be veri®ed before they can becon®dently released to production. The possibility oferrors in an NC program increases with the complex-ity of the part to be machined. Manually writtenprograms tend to have more errors than thosegenerated by software tools. These errors can beextremely costly since they often result in crashedmachines, ruined parts, damaged ®xtures, brokentools, and inaccurate part geometry. Because of thepossibility of error, regardless of whether the NCcodes are produced with a CAD/CAM system, at themachine, or somewhere in between, the resultingprogram has to be veri®ed before it can be con®dentlyreleased to production [1].

Robert S. Keidan, CFP® attended the annual Barron’s Top Independent Advisors Summit, hosted by Barron’s magazine to promote best practices in the industry and the value of advice to the investing public.  The invitation-only conference was held March 22 - 24, 2017 in Orlando, FL.
Forty-eight of Barron’s Top Financial Advisors, currently ranked in one of Barron’s Top Advisor Rankings, were in attendance. The Top Independent Advisors Summit is based on the Top 100 Independent Advisors Ranking and the advisors are chosen based on the volume of assets overseen by the advisors and their teams, revenue generated for the firms and the quality of the advisors’ practices
This exclusive conference is designed to promote best practices and generate new ideas across the industry.
“Because the Summit brings together key leaders and top decision makers from around the country, it is recognized by the financial advisor community as the industry’s leading event,” said Ed Finn, former editor and president of Barron’s. “The ideas and discussions generated here equip attendees to provide the best investment and financial advice to their clients, which are vital given the challenging economic and market conditions of today.”
Bob was one of approximately 300 financial advisors who were selected to attend and participate in the conference.
 
  
 
Third-party rankings and recognitions are no guarantee of future investment success and do not ensure that a client or prospective client will experience a higher level of performance or results.  These ratings should not be construed as an endorsement of the advisor by any client nor are they representative of any one client’s evaluation.
