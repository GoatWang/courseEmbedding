When i initially called Provider name locked. , he came immediately to look at the room, and was willing to get to work right away. He offered to buy all the necessary materials for us, adding their cost to the final bill.
The work was done thoroughly and professionally. The job was completed in two days, at a cost of $400/day. Although this price seemed appropriate for the quality of work provided, I will note that the second day of work was only about half as long as the first day.
All in all, Provider name locked. provided excellent service, and I would definitely recommend them to someone willing to pay for a very professional job.
 

            - Bebhinn F.          




Provider name locked. , Provider name locked. and Provider name locked. did an outstanding job.  They arrived everyday on time, worked hard with few breaks.  Worked through the end of the day and cleaned up well.  They were a pleasure to have in our home.   The one thing that worked to our advantage was a detailed scope of work.  This was a comprehensive document that detailed exactly our expectations from the number of primer coats, number of top coats, type and brand of paint to be used and a list of exactly what work we wanted done.

  The only aspect of the job we felt could have gone better was the surface preparation.  We were fairly explicit in our scope of work that every surface was to be prepared to a level we wanted. This included nail pops, nail holes on trim, dings and gouges.  While there was a cursory effort I had to check and double check all the areas I had identified as areas I would have corrected had I done the painting myself.  At the end of the day I would Provider name locked. areas I wanted more attention.  To Provider name locked. 's credit he addressed everyone of the items cheerfully and properly.   Most of this had to do with the fact that his crew's work may not have been scrunitized sufficiently.  Nature of the beast that the professional has the experience and expertise to do a job to one level.  Employees, not necessarily.  

 After final payment was made we discovered a few elements that we missed. Provider name locked. came back promptly and fixed each of them. This usually when customers have problems, not here.  

While his prices were a tad high compared to other bids at the end of the day we got an outstanding paint job at a fair price.  We highly recommend Provider name locked. .  With contractors often the cause of anguish and confrontation Provider name locked. is one of the good guys. 
 

            - Daniel R.          




I contacted Provider name locked. for an estimate to paint an average sized bedroom, which needed a lot of prep & repair work.  The ceiling was peeling and there was a settlement crack.  The room was totally empty so no furniture needed to be moved or worked around.  Also, our single car wooden garage door needed to be sanded and repainted.  
Heritage was very responsive as far as setting up an appointment to give us an estimate, and Provider name locked. arrived and took a look, answered all my questions, and told me what would be involved.  He e-mailed an estimate very promptly.
The only problem is that the estimate he gave us was more than twice the price of two other painting companies, one of which we went with, and whose work we are very happy with. Otherwise, I believe this company is knowledgeable and professional, they just were overpriced in my opinion.
