Explanation of Responses:
1. These Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), which were scheduled to vest on or prior to February 29, 2016, were fully vested and cancelled pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 9, 2015, among the issuer, XPO Logistics, Inc. ("XPO") and Canada Merger Corp. (the "Merger Agreement"), in exchange for a cash amount equal to the per share merger consideration of $47.60 (the "Per Share Merger Consideration") multiplied by number of shares of the issuers common stock ("Shares") subject to such RSU.
2. Because the reporting person has received notice from XPO that he will experience a severance-qualifying termination of employment upon the completion of the merger, the Merger Agreement and applicable letter agreement provides that these RSUs were cancelled and converted into a cash amount equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole cent) of (i) the number of Shares subject to such RSUs and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.
3. These Performance Share Plan Units ("PSPUs"), which were scheduled to vest on or prior to February 29, 2016, were fully vested (with the performance-based vesting conditions deemed satisfied at target) and cancelled in exchange for a cash amount equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by number of Shares subject to such PSPU.
4. Because the reporting person has received notice from XPO that he will experience a severance-qualifying termination of employment upon the completion of the merger, the Merger Agreement and applicable letter agreement provides that these PSPUs were cancelled and converted into a cash amount equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole cent) of (i) the number of Shares subject to such PSPUs (determined assuming that performance-based vesting conditions applicable to the PSPUs are satisfied at target) and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.
5. Each stock appreciation right, whether vested or unvested, was converted pursuant to the Merger Agreement into a stock appreciation right to purchase XPO Shares on the same terms and conditions as applicable to this stock appreciation right, with the number of XPO Shares subject to such converted right being equal to the product (rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares) of (i) the total number of Shares underlying the stock appreciation right as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Amount.  The exercise price applicable to such converted right is equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share applicable to such stock appreciation right immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Equity  Award Conversion Amount.
6. Each option, whether vested or unvested, was converted pursuant to the Merger Agreement into an option to purchase XPO Shares on the same terms and conditions as applicable to this option, with the number of XPO Shares subject to such converted right being equal to the product (rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares) of (i) the total number of Shares underlying the option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Amount.  The exercise price applicable to such converted right is equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share applicable to such option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Equity  Award Conversion Amount.
7. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each Phantom Stock Unit will be deemed to be an obligation relating to XPO Shares, with the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such original  Phantom Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting and settlement terms and conditions), and relating to the number of XPO Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares in respect of a Phantom Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Amount, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole number of shares.
