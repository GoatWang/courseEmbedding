	TCP Capital Corp. is an externally-managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company focused on middle-market lending. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Our stock is traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "TCPC".

	Our investment objective is to achieve high total returns through current income and capital appreciation, with an emphasis on principal protection. We invest primarily in debt of private, middle-market companies with enterprise values typically between $100 million and $1.5 billion, including complex situations requiring specialized industry knowledge. While we invest primarily in senior debt instruments, we have the flexibility to provide financing solutions at any level of the capital structure. With our rigorous approach to due diligence, active investment monitoring and long-term perspective, we are an ideal partner for companies and sponsors seeking a stable source of capital.

	Our investment activities benefit from the competitive advantages of our investment advisor, Tennenbaum Capital Partners, LLC (TCP) (www.tennenbaumcapital.com), including the deep skills and diverse experience of its investment professionals, its proprietary deal flow, and its consistent and rigorous investment process.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

SANTA MONICA, Calif., May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- TCP Capital Corp. ("we," "us," "our," "TCPC" or the "Company"), a business development company ("BDC") (NASDAQ:   TCPC), today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 and filed its Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.








FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Net investment income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $19.9 million, or $0.38 per share on a diluted basis, net of $0.09 per share in incentive compensation. 
Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $19.4 million, or $0.37 per share. 
Net asset value per share at March 31, 2017 increased to $14.92 from $14.91 at December 31, 2016, primarily a result of net investment income in excess of paid dividends. 
Total acquisitions during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $139.8 million and total dispositions were $117.0 million. 
On May 9, 2017, our board of directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.36 per share payable on June 30, 2017 to shareholders of record as of June 16, 2017. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on April 25, 2017 we closed a public offering of 5.75 million shares of our common stock at $16.84 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $96.8 million and net proceeds of approximately $93.6 million.

"We are pleased with our strong performance during the first quarter of 2017, as we out-earned our dividend by $0.02 per share," said Howard Levkowitz, TCP Capital Corp. Chairman and CEO. "In the first quarter, we originated over $139 million in loans, with net deployments of approximately $22.8 million. The weighted average effective yield on our originations during the quarter was approximately 10 basis points higher than the yield of our repaid investments, even while spreads generally tightened during the period.  With our robust direct origination platform, we are seeing a significant volume of attractive opportunities, which enables us to grow our portfolio while continuing to be highly selective and disciplined in our investing."  
PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
As of March 31, 2017, our investment portfolio consisted of debt and equity positions in 88 portfolio companies with a total fair value of approximately $1.34 billion. Debt positions represented approximately 95% of the portfolio at fair value, substantially all of which were senior secured debt. Equity positions, including equity interests in portfolios of debt and lease assets, represented approximately 5% of our investment portfolio.
As of March 31, 2017, the weighted average annual effective yield of our debt portfolio was approximately 11.1%.(1) As of March 31, 2017, approximately 83% of our debt portfolio at fair value had floating interest rates. As of March 31, 2017, we had three debt investments on non-accrual status, totaling 0.4% of the portfolio at fair value. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we invested approximately $139.8 million, primarily in nine investments, comprised of four new and five existing portfolio companies. The investments were comprised of approximately $126.9 million in senior secured loans and $6.6 million in senior secured notes. The remaining $6.3 million was comprised of equity investments, including $5.7 million of additional equity interests in portfolios of debt and lease assets. Additionally, we received proceeds from sales and repayments of investment principal of approximately $117.0 million. We expect to continue to invest in senior secured loans, bonds and subordinated debt, as well as select equity investments, to obtain a high level of current income and create the potential for appreciation, with an emphasis on principal protection. 
As of March 31, 2017, total assets were $1,414.1 million, net assets applicable to common shareholders were $791.3 million and net asset value per share was $14.92, as compared to $1,387.6 million, $790.9 million, and $14.91 per share, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.
(1) Weighted average annual effective yield includes amortization of deferred debt origination and end-of-term fees and accretion of original issue discount, but excludes market discount, any prepayment and make-whole fee income, and any debt investments on non-accrual status.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Total investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $39.3 million, or $0.74 per share, including $0.06 per share from prepayment premiums and related accelerated original issue discount amortization, $0.05 per share from recurring original issue discount amortization and $0.07 per share from recurring income paid in kind. This reflects our policy of recording interest income, adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts, on an accrual basis. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment, and similar upfront fees received in connection with the outlay of capital are generally amortized into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. 
Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were approximately $14.5 million, or $0.27 per share, including interest and other debt expenses of $7.8 million, or $0.15 per share. We also incurred incentive compensation from net investment income of $5.0 million, or $0.09 per share. Excluding incentive compensation, interest and other debt expenses, annualized first quarter expenses were 3.4% of average net assets. 
Net investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $24.9 million, or $0.47 per share, before incentive compensation. Net investment income after incentive compensation was $19.9 million, or $0.38 per share.
Net realized and unrealized losses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, comprised of net realized losses of $5.1 million, or $0.10 per share, and unrealized gains of $4.6 million, or $0.09 per share. 
Net increase in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $19.4 million, or $0.37 per share.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of March 31, 2017, available liquidity was approximately $397.9 million, comprised of approximately $344.0 million in available capacity under our leverage program and $56.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, less approximately $2.1 million in net outstanding settlements. 
The combined weighted-average interest rate on debt outstanding at March 31, 2017 was 3.99%.

Benefits of LED Lighting
LED light bulbs can save you money not only because they are roughly 80% more energy efficient than other bulbs, they also produce far less heat than metal halides, CFLs, and incandescent light bulbs. Upgrading to LED lighting means you won’t spend your summer months cooling down rooms that your light bulbs are busy heating up. While originally a cooler blue tone than incandescent bulbs, LEDs now come in daylight and warm white color temperatures so you can more easily replace your existing bulbs without altering the color of your room. Visit our Lighting Guide to see what difference color temperature makes. LED lighting also offers a superior color rendering index (CRI), so you can see the colors of your artwork or makeup more accurately.
LED replacement bulbs are durable and ecologically friendly. Did you know you can recycle LED bulbs and reduce your carbon footprint up to one third? LEDs outlast the competition, staying bright for up to 11 years of continuous operation. This means less time climbing ladders trying to replace those hard to reach bulbs in vaulted ceilings. 
 LEDs are one of today’s most promising technologies.

No mercury, making them a cleaner alternative to fluorescent and CFL lamps.
The lowest energy consumption of any lighting product to date.
Light quality equal or superior to traditional lighting products.
Life that is 20 times than some traditional lighting products.



LEDs or Fluorescents - Which is More Efficient?


LED light bulbs for the win! When it comes to purchasing energy-efficient lighting, LEDs surpass CFLs by a wide margin. LEDs are instant-start with no warmup time needed. They work well in cold weather, and are substantially more durable since manufactured out of plastic instead of glass. From standard bulbs to fluorescent tubes, LEDs can replicate the same lighting conditions found in fluorescents while lasting longer and using less energy. As an added bonus, all LEDs are RoHS compliant and do not use mercury, a claim that can't be made by fluorescent bulbs.

LED Lighting Options




Standard Shape A19
 - Designed to give the appearance and pattern of a standard incandescent bulb. Standard and A-shape LED bulbs fit the same sockets and fixtures as your current household lights.



3-Way LED
 - A three-way bulb is a light bulb that has two brightness settings instead of the standard on or off. If your lamp or fixture says it requires a three-way bulb, this is the category for you.



Vintage LED Bulbs
- Vintage reproduction bulbs are now available with LED filament. They have a warm orange glow with lower light levels to mimic the style of a vintage bulb on a dimmer as it transitions from yellow to orange. These
Edison style and
Victorian style bulbs make great collector items. Order yours today to make your own steampunk lighting.



Wet Location LED Bulbs
 - A wet location UL rating means these LED light bulbs can be used in humid indoor areas or outdoors where water may drop or flow against the bulb or fixture.



Decorative LED Bulbs
 - Browse
LED globe lights ranging from 3 in. to 1.5 in. diameters or find LED replacement bulbs for your
chandelier light bulbs. The long life of LEDs mean less time on the ladder changing burnt out bulbs. Many LED chandelier lights are dimmer switch compatible and come in a range of color temperature so you can still enjoy the ambiance of traditional bulbs but the energy savings of LEDs.



LED Tubes
 - LED tubes are the emerging standard for commercial and household lighting. Ranging in size from T5 to T12 and a variety of color temperatures, these LED tubes are an easy way to upgrade to energy efficient lighting. Some of them work with or without an existing ballast, making the transition to LED lighting easier than ever. These LED tubes emit the same amount of light as fluorescent T8s, while using a fraction of the power and lasting up to three times longer. LED tubes are especially effective in cold areas like refrigeration lockers where fluorescent tubes are less efficient at producing light.



LED Tape Lights
 - For accents, alcove, and backlighting, LED tape light is a fantastic choice. More flexible than rope light and bright enough for accent illumination, a strip of LED tape light can bring any place to life. There are countless uses and applications for this easily installed new light source.



Shatter Resistant LED Bulbs
 - Dipped in a special coating, these bulbs may still break if dropped, but they won’t shatter into pieces and fly across your floor. We recommend not dropping them, but if you do, these make cleanup quite a bit easier.



LED Night Lights
 - Keep the monsters away with LED night lights. Motion activated, and battery powered, these LED bulbs will light the way to the bathroom or give reassurance that nothing is lurking under the bed when your child needs to reach for a dropped retainer or teddy bear. Mounted using tape or screws, light only the area you need without waking sleeping babies.



Reflectors
 - From the powerful flood and spot lights, to home bound recessed or track lights, reflectors find excellent use indoors or out. LED reflector lamps can provide the same brilliance for less energy and will create far less heat than an incandescent or halogen lamp. As a bonus, they have a higher CRI than fluorescent reflectors for better colors.


Shop by Brand - Shop top brands for LED light bulbs including
Cree and
Soraa. Watch installation videos for help retrofitting an existing structure or give us a call to talk to a licensed electrician.



Things to Consider When Buying LED Lighting




Equivalent Wattage - While lumens are the new standard, it helps to have an easily recognizable guide. Comparing an LED bulb to an incandescent will give you a rough estimate of just how well it will light a room. As a very ballpark figure for LED wattages, 1/4 or 1/5 the incandescent wattage value is usually close to what you need.


Lumens - Lumens directly measure just how much light the bulb gives out in total. On average, a 60-watt incandescent shines at 800 lumens, with roughly 50-100 lumens of difference above or below. The variance depends on manufacturer and age of the lamp. LEDs are directly rated for their max lumen rating and last much longer without dimming of the bulb.


Color Temperature - Your guide to how the light itself will look. Lower values are warmer, with 2700-3000K being a more incandescent "warm white" while higher temperatures like 5000K will deliver a very harsh "stark white" light. Our  Lighting Guide lets you select a color temperature and see how it transforms a kitchen.
        

Driver Content - Because of their design, LEDs do not typically run on AC voltage.  Many LEDs require some form of 
            driver to convert the voltage from AC to DC for proper operation.  The majority of socket-based LED lamps are self-driven, but you should always check before buying to make sure that you buy both an LED and a 
            driver
             at the same time if it isn't self-driven.

The 1000Bulbs.com Difference

The quality you need. We carry lighting products by Sylvania, GE Lighting, Philips Lighting, and many more trusted manufacturers.
The affordable prices you want. Our extremely low prices reflect our number one goal: Making quality lighting affordable to everyone!
A huge selection and helpful application information. We have thousands of lights and lighting accessories to fit your specific needs.
Lighting that saves you money. Our energy-saving compact fluorescents and LED bulbs can drastically reduce your energy costs and help protect the environment.

Selecting the Right Bulb
Incandescent
Incandescent bulbs, which provide most home lighting, are used in products from nightlights to floodlights. The most common incandescent is a pear-shaped (A19) bulb with a medium-sized screw-type base. Incandescent lights use electricity to heat a filament until it glows white hot, producing light. About 90 percent of the electricity used by incandescent bulbs is lost as heat. This style typically burns for 750 to 10,000 hours.
Halogen
Halogen bulbs contain a small capsule filled with Halogen gas, which emits a bright white light. Long life and full spectrum Halogen bulbs use less energy and last longer than standard incandescent bulbs of the same wattage. The life of these bulbs is around 2,000 to 10,000 hours or two to five years.
Linear Fluorescent
Linear fluorescent bulbs, also known as fluorescent tubes, are more energy efficient than incandescents or halogens because they don't produce much heat. These are the thin, long tube lights often found in kitchens for under-cabinet lighting, or in garages, workshops, and basements. The tubes can last from 10,000 to 44,000 hours—10 to 40 times longer than incandescent lights. Fluorescent bulbs require and are powered by fluorescent ballasts.
Compact Fluorescent
Compact fluorescents, also known as CFLs, provide as much light as regular incandescent bulbs while using just one-fourth of the energy. For example, a 15-watt compact fluorescent light bulb yields the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. Compact fluorescent bulbs last about 10,000 hours—10 times longer than incandescent bulbs.
High Intensity Discharge
High intensity discharge, or HID, bulbs include metal halide, high pressure sodium, and mercury vapor lights. As their name implies, HID bulbs emit a very large amount of light using relatively little power. They are a mainstay of parking lot, street, and warehouse lighting. Like fluorescent bulbs, HID bulbs also require a ballast.
Stage and Studio
Stage bulbs and photography lights are specialized, high output lights used in the entertainment industry as well as in just about any stage or photography studio. Traditionally, these bulbs have used Halogen or HID technology, though LED stage lights are becoming more common.
Miniature Indicator
Miniature indicator bulbs are found in everything from heavy machinery to instrument panels. Though we carry hundreds of miniature bulbs, you can find the replacement you need by identifying the numeric code stamped on the base of your old bulb.
Automotive
Automotive bulbs include everything from Halogen headlight capsules to the tiny incandescent bulbs that go in makeup mirrors and everything in between. No matter the make or model of your car, we have the bulb that fits.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
