Lester L. Lyles
 GENERAL, USAF (RET.) | Chairman of the Board



FAMILY STRONG
Dear Fellow Members,
In this report, you'll read just a few of the stories from the USAA family. These members face their own unique challenges and hopes for the future, and — like you — they share a connection to the military, as well as a desire to do the right things for their families and our country.

 My own connection to military service — and, ultimately, to USAA — started with a 19–year–old young man who enlisted in the Army during World War II. My father never talked much about his military service, and only after he died did I find out he was part of the 332nd Fighter
Group — the legendary Tuskegee Airmen. My father's military–inspired values of dedication to family and hard work were nevertheless a model I tried to follow when I joined the Air Force.
 USAA, in many ways, is like an extended family imbued with the values, mutual support and camaraderie that are a big part of military life. That photo of a young Lester Lyles is a reminder that I was a part of the USAA family long before I became a general, and USAA took good care of me. In 2014, we welcomed new family members with the same care, grew stronger as an organization and prepared for a new chapter in our history.
When service members, veterans and their families decide to become USAA members, it's a cause for celebration because it means we can continue to fulfill our mission to facilitate the financial security of military families. In 2014, many new members joined the USAA family — as total
membership reached 10.7 million by the end of the year. We hope they, like 92% of our members, intend to stay members for life.

As we welcome more members, we're working hard to keep delivering the industry's best service. Although we're not perfect, we're proud that 81% gave USAA the highest possible marks for service in our overall member satisfaction surveys. And USAA continues to be recognized in our industries for service and customer satisfaction. For instance, USAA received the 2014 Customer Experience Index Award of Excellence from Forrester Research Inc.,1 which also ranked USAA's bank, credit card and insurance businesses No. 1 in their respective industries.
Property and Casualty Ratings2

Excellent service, a growing family and careful financial management usually translate into positive financial results, and 2014 was no exception. USAA has never been stronger financially  — or better prepared to help our members. USAA was one of only a handful of companies to receive the highest possible3 ratings for its property and casualty insurance group from all three major rating agencies: Moody's, Standard & Poor's and A.M. Best.
As members of the board of directors, we watch these developments closely. Our role is to oversee the strategic direction of USAA and make sure that human, financial and other resources are in place to meet our objectives and fulfill our mission. That includes assessing the performance of our top executives and ensuring continuity of leadership.
Last year, President and CEO Joe Robles Jr. announced he would retire, effective Feb. 28, 2015, after more than seven years as CEO and 20 in leadership at USAA. First, let me say that USAA is better for having had Joe as its leader. From helping open the doors to membership to all who have received a discharge type of Honorable to leading veteran-hiring efforts, promoting innovation and helping navigate USAA financially through tumultuous economic conditions, Joe has been a transformational CEO by any measure. Today, USAA is more focused than ever on putting our membership first in relentless pursuit of our mission and being a best place to work for our employees. Thank you, Joe, for your exceptional leadership. 
This year, the board conducted an exhaustive internal and external search for our next CEO, applying the care and rigor USAA members deserve. The process ended in August with the naming of 16–year USAA employee and Air Force veteran Stuart Parker as our next president and CEO. As a board, we are ensuring that Stuart has the resources and support he and his leadership team need to continue taking care of our members and fulfilling the mission.
The baton passes, but what started nearly 93 years ago when Army officers decided to insure one another continues. Thank you for your membership and for letting USAA be a part of your family's story.


Sincerely, Lester L. Lyles GENERAL, USAF (RET.)Chairman of the Board





An organization often reflects the salient characteristics of its leaders. With Joe Robles serving as president and CEO for the past
seven years, our members and employees are fortunate indeed.
What's amazing to those who have known and worked with him is not what he has done, but who he is as a person. And that's a leader of uncommon humility, genuine care for people and dedication to the military community.
This organization is better off for having had Joe as its leader. On behalf of the board of directors and more than 27,000 USAA employees, we thank Joe for his uncommon leadership and wish him well in retirement.

			Lester Lyles, a retired Four-Star General of the U. S. Air Force, has been an independent consultant since 2003. Prior to that time, he served in the U.S. Air Force for over 35 years as: Commander of the Space and Missile Systems Center from 1994 to 1996; Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization from 1996 to 1999; Vice Chief of Staff of the Headquarters of the U.S. Air Force from 1999 to 2000; and Commander of the U.S. Air Force Materiel Command from 2000 to 2003.
General Lyles holds a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Howard University in Washington D.C. and a Master of Science degree in mechanical and nuclear engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology Program from New Mexico State University in Las Cruces. He is a graduate of the Defense Systems Management College, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, the Armed Forces Staff College, Norfolk, Virginia, the National War College, Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington, D.C., and the National and International Security Management Course at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. General Lyles received Honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from New Mexico State University and Urbana University.
General Lyles currently serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the United Services Automobile Association. He is also a director of General Dynamics Corporation, where he serves on the Audit Committee, and Baltelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit organization. General Lyles is a member of the International Security Advisory Board at the U.S. State Department and a member of the NASA Advisory Council. He has served on the Defense Science Board in the Pentagon since 2009, and he served on the President's Intelligence Advisory Board in the White House from 2009-2013. General Lyles served as a director of the Dayton Power and Light Company until its acquisition by The AES Corporation in 2012. He served as a director of Precision Castparts Corp. until its acquisition by Berkshire Hathaway in February 2016. General Lyles was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2009.
In light of the importance of KBR's relationship with the U.S. government as a primary provider of logistical support for U.S. forces deployed in the Middle East and elsewhere, the Board of Directors considered General Lyles's distinguished experience in the U.S. Air Force, especially his command of the Air Force Materiel Command, as the most important factor in concluding that General Lyles should continue to serve on the Board. In addition, General Lyles qualifies as an audit committee financial expert under the rules of the NYSE and provides expertise that assists the Board and the Audit Committee with their risk oversight function.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
