 KIRKLAND, Wash. – July 20, 2016 – TableSafe Inc., innovators of the RAIL™ pay-at-the-table platform, today announced that their RAIL 2 payment system has achieved PCI PTS certification.  The certification validates the RAIL 2 payment platform complies with the industry’s highest standards of security, data integrity and privacy protection for processing electronic payments.  The certification also clears the path for TableSafe to initiate manufacturing to fulfill the backlog of market demand for this highly anticipated product.
Developed by the founding payment brands of the PCI Security Standards Council, the PCI PTS is a multi-faceted security standard that includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design and hardware manufacturing.  The PCI certification ensures that a product conforms to payment card data theft protections standards mandated by the PCI Security Standards Council. 
“With the surging risk of credit card fraud and chargebacks many full-service restaurants are looking to provide increased protection for their customers’ card data and their establishment,” said Steve McKean, president of TableSafe. “The RAIL 2 is one of the elite few restaurant-focused PTS certified payment platforms in the U.S. helping to guard customers and restaurants from consumer fraud.”
The RAIL is housed inside a patented billfold replicating the traditional folio a restaurant uses to deliver the guest’s check.  Incorporating the latest payment technology, the RAIL is designed to accept both current and future payment methods including traditional Mag stripe, EMV (chip and signature, and chip and pin), NFC (Apple Pay, Android Pay), QR/UPC code and credit card companies’ mobile payment applications.  This payment agnostic system will allow guests the ability to securely self-insert or self-swipe credit, debit or chip-enabled cards or pay with their phone while keeping their credit card and identity securely under their control.  It also allows the guest to auto-calculate the tip, split the bill multiple ways, pay-by-item, and receive email receipts. 
“A restaurant depends on delivering the highest level of customer service and brand experience to drive their business, so unlike most of the payment devices in the market today, we designed the RAIL to complement the dining experience rather than disrupt it,” said McKean.  “The RAIL system provides the guest with the highest level of security, freedom of payment choice and the ability to control the length of time to complete the payment process.”
In addition to providing PCI compliance, Point-to-Point Encryption and other security features, the TableSafe System also provides restauranteurs with operational benefits such as improved staff efficiency, quicker table turn, and greater customer satisfaction - resulting in increased revenue.   
TableSafe will begin distributing the RAIL 2 payment system in multiple local Seattle-area restaurants this summer and initiate a national pilot program with strategic customers in the Fall 2016. 
For more information on TableSafe and its innovative payment platform, visit www.tablesafe.com. 
About TableSafe
TableSafe® provides innovative technology designed specifically for the restaurant industry.  TableSafe’s RAIL™ payment platform offers restaurants point-to-point encryption (P2PE) security and the versatility to accept any form of payment directly from the table, including Mag-stripe, EMV, and NFC- payment options. The RAIL also increases staff efficiency by eliminating the traditional multiple trips back and forth from the customer to their POS system. Visitwww.tablesafe.com
About PCI certification:
When granted, PCI SSC approval is provided by PCI SSC to ensure certain security and operational characteristics important to the achievement of PCI SSC’s goals, but PCI SSC approval does not under any circumstances include any endorsement or warranty regarding the functionality, quality or performance of any particular product or service. PCI SSC does not warrant any products or services provided by third parties. PCI SSC approval does not under any circumstances include or imply any product warranties from PCI SSC, including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for purpose, or non-infringement, all of which are expressly disclaimed by PCI SSC. All rights and remedies regarding products and services which have received PCI SSC approval shall be provided by the party providing such products or services, and not by PCI SSC.
