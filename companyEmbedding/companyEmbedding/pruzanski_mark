Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is an American biopharmaceutical company incorporated in 2002, focusing on the development of novel synthetic bile acid analogs to treat chronic liver diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) now called primary biliary cholangitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), cirrhosis, portal hypertension, primary sclerosing cholangitis and also the intestinal disorder, bile acid diarrhea.

Products[edit]
The company's lead product is obeticholic acid, OCA, also known as 6-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid or INT-747, marketed as Ocaliva. OCA is a potent first-in-class farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist. As of March 2017, Ocaliva is approved in the US and the EU for use in primary biliary cholangitis. It is in phase III studies for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and phase II studies for primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Other products in the development pipeline include INT-767, a dual FXR/TGR5 agonist, and INT-777, a TGR5 agonist.
Initial public offering and stock history[edit]
Intercept trades on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol ICPT. The initial public offering of the stock on October 16, 2012 was at $15.[1] A follow-on public offering at $33 took place on June 24, 2013.
On January 9, 2014, the stock skyrocketed from $72.39 to $275.49, or about 280%, after a planned interim analysis by the independent data safety monitoring board showed that Obeticholic acid met the main goal (improvement of liver histology) at the mid-stage in the FLINT trial in NASH, sponsored by NIDDK.[2][3] The stock continued to climb to $497 over the next few days before falling back to around $317 on March 29, 2014, giving a market capitalization of around $6.2 billion.
In March 2014, the company released the results of the POISE study of Obeticholic acid in PBC, which showed the drug met the trial's primary endpoint of a reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker for the disease.[4] These results were presented at an international liver meeting in April 2014.[5]
As of 31 December 2014, the company had 136 employees.[6]

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Dr. Mark E. Pruzansky




Dr. Mark E. Pruzansky, Director of HandSport Surgery Institute, is a seasoned specialist in hand surgery, wrist surgery and microsurgery, sports injuries and arthroscopic and reconstructive surgery of the hand, wrist, elbow and brachial plexus.  With more than 20 years of high-level practice and a comprehensive knowledge of the body’s biomechanical linkages, Dr. Pruzansky is able to diagnose patients using a “kinetic-chain approach” that reveals underlying—and often overlooked—issues coming from other parts of the musculo-skeletal system.
With three board certifications in Surgery of the Hand, Orthopaedic Sports Medicine and Orthopaedic Surgery (2.1% of hand surgeons worldwide, July 2015), Dr. Pruzansky is uniquely able to diagnose and treat hand and upper extremity conditions that are specific to elite and amateur athletes in addition to those afflicting almost everyone in any occupation, including retirement. One of the country’s most experienced practitioners of  Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery—over 3000 cases—and a pioneer in the treatment of Tennis Elbow, Dr. Pruzansky is dedicated to the delivery of state-of-the art surgical and medical treatment as well as supervising the patient’s occupational and physical therapy. His expertise in solving difficult problems of the hand, wrist and upper extremity is often sought, and he has been a hand surgery consultant to WABC-TV with appearances on Eyewitness News. Complex reconstructions, including Revision Surgery, are referred to the practice for evaluation and treatment.
Dr. Pruzansky graduated with honors from both Columbia College and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Orthopaedic Program in New York. He was a Hand Surgery Fellow in San Francisco, where he was certified in microsurgery and studied under one of the country’s most renowned pioneers of joint replacements for arthritic fingers and wrists.
While a Hand Surgery Fellow in New Orleans, Dr. Pruzansky studied with one of the fathers of adult reconstructive hand and wrist surgery, who was also a founder of congenital deformities surgery. He then furthered his studies in sports medicine and treatment of sports-related injuries of the hand and upper extremity at the Southern California Orthopaedic Institute in Van Nuys.
In addition to being the director of the HandSport® Surgery Institute, Dr. Pruzansky is affiliated with Mount Sinai Medical Center and Medical School and Lenox Hill Hospital. He is a faculty lecturer at Mount Sinai Medical Center and has spoken on the national and regional levels to medical students, residents and physicians.  Also to his credit, Dr. Pruzansky is a leading research fundraiser and a member of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the American Society for Surgery of the Hand, the International Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand, the New York Society for Surgery of the Hand and the Orthopaedic Research Society.

An athlete himself, he plays tennis and golf, downhill skis, does cardio, and lifts. Named one of the Tri-State region’s finest hand surgeons in New York magazine’s medical peer-reviewed “Best Doctors” 2008 issue, Dr. Pruzansky provides patients with innovative diagnostic and surgical techniques as well as respect and compassion.
