Funds have a long track record and there is a sizable existing asset base.ConsThere is an extensive amount of nepotism at this firm although it's to be expected at many firms of this size. The people running the sales team at this institution are unorganized, have little clear direction. There was a big cultural divide with the sales team treated as "overhead" while the PMs were put on a pedestal. Promises of big upsides are the carrot used by management but the products are rather difficult to push as they are very non-traditional and do not easily fit the retail Morningstar model. It would be difficult to recommend Tocqueville to professionals legitimately interested in financial sales.Advice to ManagementMore buy-in with respect to the sales effort. Fix the culture. Recognize that the products are unique and thus more difficult to close.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Tocqueville Asset Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Tocqueville Asset Management 2015-10-18 15:04 PDT Sep 16, 2015"Just want some access to Glass Door"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Analyst in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Analyst in New York, NYNeutral OutlookI have been working at Tocqueville Asset Management full-time (More than 5 years)Prosnice people flexible schedule for meConstoo many mouths to feedAdvice to Managementbring back sodas to the fridgeShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Tocqueville Asset Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Tocqueville Asset Management 2015-09-16 11:27 PDT Jun 5, 2015"Good firm"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookProsRwk is generous and smart CEOConsNothing I want to shareShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Tocqueville Asset Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Tocqueville Asset Management 2015-06-05 14:31 PDT Apr 29, 2014"Good asset manager with notable track-record"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsNeutral OutlookI worked at Tocqueville Asset Management full-time (More than 5 years)ProsHours, compensation, perks are probably among the best in the industry.

Our Firm





Our Firm
Tocqueville Asset Management L.P. was founded in 1985 as an independently owned partnership focusing exclusively on the long-term growth and preservation of our clients’ capital.
Our firm follows two guiding principles:

Provide excellent client service.
Avoid speculation and resist fads.




How Are We Different?












Autonomy
Tocqueville is a wholly independent, privately owned partnership. This eliminates the corporate conformity often found in public companies – a conformity that arises from the need to provide short-term shareholder value.
It also allows for an alignment of interests: Portfolio managers at Tocqueville invest alongside clients, putting our own capital into the same investments that we recommend to our clients. And our autonomy ensures that we never sell products or services that our clients do not need. The term “relationship manager” does not exist at Tocqueville.





Meeting Your Needs
Our respectable investment returns notwithstanding, we measure our success by the long-term relationships we develop with people who have come to us to preserve, protect, and enhance their capital. Consequently, our firm’s focus is to provide our clients with outstanding service, rather than marketing the investment flavor of the day.
What does outstanding service mean to you? You want access: to your investments, to your investment team, at any time. We are dedicated to providing that access, to responding rapidly to your needs. And the measure of our service is a client with financial peace of mind.





Time
We evaluate the success of our investment decisions over years rather than weeks or quarters, and we avoid the noise and hyperbole of Wall Street and its attendant media by relying upon rigorous proprietary research to buttress those decisions. The term “relationship manager” does not exist at Tocqueville.
Focusing on the signal rather than the noise, while taking a long-term perspective, allows us to look past ephemeral investment schemes and seek out more durable opportunities.




Let us introduce ourselves to you

Dear Fellow Shareholder,                                                        

In the past year, despite a difficult investment environment, our funds 
have continued to perform in a generally satisfactory manner. Today, however,   
we face a major uncertainty to the economic and financial outlook, largely      
because of the imbalance of the US balance of payments and the increased        
pressure it is putting on the dollar.                                           

Over the last two-and-a-half years, the dollar has declined about 37%   
against the European Euro, 23% against the Japanese Yen, 28% against the        
British pound and 26% against the Canadian dollar. Over the same period, the US 
currency has also depreciated about 9% against the Taiwanese dollar, 12%        
against the Singapore dollar, 14% against the Thai baht and 23% against the     
South Korean won. More recently, over the last 18 months, it even lost more     
than 30% against the Brazilian real, although that currency had previously      
suffered a severe crisis and devaluation, so that the parity between the two    
currencies is roughly back to where it was in mid-2001.                         

On a trade-weighted basis the dollar is down "only" 17% from its high of
recent years. Partly, this is because it has gained 25% against the Mexican     
peso but also because it has not moved at all against the Chinese renminbi,     
which is pegged to it. In recent weeks, however, the depreciation of the US     
currency has accelerated as speculation mounted that the Chinese renminbi would 
soon be un-pegged and thus, de facto, revalued.                                 

It is not at all clear how much benefit will accrue to US trade from the
recent and prospective revaluations of most of its main trading partners'       
currencies. One reason is that wage rates in many less-developed economies are  
so much lower than in the United States; the other is that many of these        
countries' costs (particularly imported oil and other commodities) are priced   
in dollars.                                                                     

But a lesser need or desire on the part of foreign central banks to     
intervene in the currencies markets in support of the dollar is certain to have 
a significant influence on international capital flows. The strong economic     
growth and buoyant financial markets enjoyed by the United States in recent     
years have been made possible by the absorption of large amounts of capital     
from abroad. A drought in these inflows would inevitably result in lower        
economic growth for the United States, as well as upward pressure on US         
interest rates and downward pressure on US price-earnings ratios. The impact on 
economies and financial markets abroad is also likely to be significant,        
although difficult to evaluate at this time.                                    

  Most major companies operate in many international markets and the impact,
positive or negative, of these developments on their sales and profits cannot   
be taken for granted. As usual, we believe that our future success will depend  
on our ability to carefully analyze individual companies in a fundamental,      
long-term perspective. This is a challenge and opportunity that we look forward 
to assuming on your behalf.                                                     

Respectfully,                                                                   

/s/                                                                             

Francois Sicart

The Tocqueville Fund                                                            

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Fellow Shareholder,                                                        

Like most mutual funds, our fiscal year ends on October 31. Thus, the   
results of the election were not known at the time we closed our books for the  
year. As of the thirty-first, the election was considered a toss-up and this    
uncertainty was reflected in the market. While The Tocqueville Fund's           
performance over the twelve-month period, +13.7%, was very gratifying, and,     
indeed, the overall market, as measured by the S&P 500 index, put in a very     
respectable 9.4% gain, most of the returns came in the first half of the fiscal 
year. During the last six months, the Fund and the market chalked up more       
modest gains as investors pondered the direction of the political winds.        

Since the election, of course, the market has rallied smartly, as these 
uncertainties were resolved. For the time being at least, the market seems to   
like what it sees regarding economic and international policies of the second   
term. The currency markets, on the other hand, do not. The dollar has been      
tumbling since the election, particularly against the Euro.                     

From my vantage point, this sell-off looks like the end of a speculative
trade. No doubt the dollar has been over-owned throughout the world, but the    
Euro's principle attraction, as far as I can tell anyway, is that it is not the 
dollar. There is nothing inherently attractive about the Euro, or, for that     
matter, the European economies when compared with the U.S., so it would be      
difficult to argue that the dollar is weakening because investors are rushing   
into European investments. Rather, it seems more likely that Middle East        
governments, flush with extra dollars from the run-up in oil prices during the  
autumn, along with their Asian counterparts, have decided to diversify their    
bond holdings by adding Euro bonds to their portfolios. After the steep rise of 
the Euro, from 82 cents to $1.34, it seems likely that the urge to diversify    
may diminish. This, coupled with the decline in oil prices and, hence, petro    
dollars, should put a lid on the Euro for the near term.                        

What does this all have to do with stocks in general, and our stocks in 
particular? Well, for one thing, it may indicate that our natural resource      
names, like Phelps Dodge, Murphy Oil, Inco, Alcoa and Teck Cominco, which have  
been such strong performers for the Fund over the past year, may be due for a   
pause, even a correction. We have been lightening up on these names on the way  
up, but we still hold sizeable positions. For the long term, we want to remain  
positioned in these shares, since we believe the great bull market in financial 
assets has come to an end and a bull market in real assets will follow. But     
these are not the most contrarian of names at this point in time and they are   
not where we are finding the best values. To that point, we have been adding to 
our incipient position in technology stocks where we have been attracted to the 
pristine balance sheets, huge cash generating abilities and strong market       
positions. Stocks like Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel, to mention three of the     
most prominent, so dearly loved not long ago (when they were trading at         
stratospheric prices and multiples) have fallen out of favor and look           
attractive from a value investor's point of view. Recent merger and acquisition 
activity in this "space," to borrow a term vastly over-used in the tech bubble, 
confirms our view that there is value to be found here.                         

 Secondly, we would not be surprised to see bargain hunting on the part of
foreign investors in U.S markets in the months ahead. U.S. stocks, real estate, 
and other dollar denominated assets may begin to look attractive to foreigners  
sitting on a currency that has appreciated by more than 60 per cent against the 
dollar over the past two and a half years. Continued interest rate rises by the 
Fed could abet this trend.                                                      

The huge rally in the market in calendar 2003, when your Fund recorded a
43% return (compared with 29% for the S&P 500), was, in our opinion a rebound   
from the deeply oversold market in calendar 2002, when the Fund declined by 14% 
and the S&P 500 by 22%. In 2004 we would have been happy to preserve the        
remarkable gains of the year before, so we are more than gratified with recent  
results. The next awful terrorist event could still happen at anytime, of       
course, but aside from that the equity markets appear, to this observer anyway, 
to have returned at last to business as usual after some tumultuous years. We   
would expect more muted results in the years ahead as well, as the eventual     
rise in interest rates, and corresponding decline in P/E ratios, counter        
balance growing profits and a growing worldwide economy. Other than an          
unpredictable terrorist threat, we see nothing to suggest that the economic     
recovery in place in the U.S. will stall, although it may well slow down.       

 In this "stockpickers" environment, we are confident that our risk-averse
contrarian value, multicap approach will serve the patient and long-term        
investor well. As large shareholders of the Fund ourselves, we are comfortable  
with that approach, and we thank you for your continued confidence and support. 

Sincerely,

The Tocqueville Small Cap Value Fund                                            

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Fellow Shareholder,                                                        

  The stock market environment of the past twelve months has been one of the
least gratifying that I can remember, and this is somewhat reflected in our     
overall returns. The appreciation The Tocqueville Small Cap Value Fund          
registered early in the year was all given back by year-end. As a result, the   
Fund had a negative total return of 1% for the year ended October 31, 2004. The 
Fund's Russell 2000 index benchmark had a total return of 11.7% over the same   
period.                                                                         

Fortunately, coming on the heels of the prior year's 54.6% total return,
these lackluster results did not detract much from our long-term performance.   
Over the past five and ten years ended October 31, 2004, The Tocqueville Small  
Cap Value Fund posted average annual total returns of 13% and 14.5% versus      
average annual total returns of 7.7 % and 10.1% respectively for the Russell    
2000 index.                                                                     

As mentioned in prior annual letters, our long-term returns validate our
value-based investment strategies of managing for the long-term, as opposed to  
trying to outperform any index over the short-term. I will try my very best to  
maintain these levels of performance in the future, and hopefully do better     
next year.                                                                      

Dividend Declared                                                               

We were fortunate to take some gains early in the year. As a result, the
Fund will declare a year-end dividend of approximately 4% or $0.66 per share,   
consisting of long-term gains.                                                  

Cautious Optimism Maintained                                                    

In retrospect, the performance of the Fund during this past fiscal year 
reflects a lack of clear economic progress by some of our most economically     
sensitive holdings. This was partly due to weaker than expected consumer        
response to expansionary fiscal and monetary policies by the Federal Reserve    
System. More specifically, our strong performance early in the fiscal year was  
fueled by anticipation of a recovery which became increasingly questionable as  
the year progressed: weak telephone equipment orders, announced automobile      
production cutbacks, and weak Far East consumer electronic production           
negatively impacted some of our largest holdings.                               

As the year progressed, we stuck to the deep-value strategies that have 
guided us over the past ten years. We added to our most depressed holdings at   
attractive prices, and we concentrated our portfolio on our most promising      
holdings. We now hold 34 stocks. We eliminated eleven stocks from the portfolio 
for a variety of reasons, and added four new ones: Agile Software Corp.,        
Informatica Corp., Maytag Corp., and Priority Healthcare Corp.                  

 We have the same 44% level of concentration in our top ten holdings as we
had last year. Two stocks are new to that list: Informatica Corp., a producer   
of business intelligence software, and Hercules Inc., a producer of specialty   
chemicals for the pulp and paper industry. These two holdings displaced 3COM    
Corp. and UNOVA Inc., which nevertheless remain large holdings of the Fund. Del 
Monte Foods Co. continues to be our single largest holding.                     

Looking at portfolio positioning in strategic terms for next year, we   
increased our leverage to deeply undervalued cyclical recovery candidates, and  
specifically to companies that have taken advantage of low interest rates to    
substantially improve their financial wherewithal or to restructure their       
operations. As a result of portfolio changes, and of a solid upturn in the      
profitability of some of our portfolio companies, our concentration of assets   
in well-positioned businesses that are losing money for the right cyclical and  
other reasons has declined to 34% of assets from 43% last year.                 

   To be even more specific, 41% of assets are invested in broadly defined old
economy sectors: 6% in oil exploration services, 21% in manufacturing and       
specialty chemicals, and 14% in automotive parts suppliers. Defensive consumer  
non-durable and healthcare related sectors appreciated to 27% of assets from    
21% a year ago, while exposure to telephone/wireless hardware declined to 15%   
and computer software services increased to 12%. Personnel and business service 
sectors represent 3% of assets, and cash equivalents 2%. Following is a listing 
of our ten largest positions.

The Tocqueville International Value Fund                                        

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Fellow Shareholder,                                                        

   For the twelve months ended October 31, 2004, The Tocqueville International
Value Fund's total US dollar return was 20.60%. In the same period, the Morgan  
Stanley EAFE Index had a total US dollar return of 19.27%.                      
We began the fiscal year in an environment marked by abundant liquidity,
synchronized global economic expansion, strong corporate earnings growth,       
stubbornly low interest rates and lofty investor sentiment. Equity markets      
continued the upward trajectory begun in 2003 through most of the first half of 
the fiscal year. At mid-year, spirits turned nervous, as attention focused on   
high oil prices, instability in the Middle East, indications that the US Fed    
would finally raise rates and the declaration that the Chinese government       
wished to slow its growth. Valuations corrected across asset classes, abruptly  
in areas populated by speculative investors, like commodities and related       
stocks, and the US dollar recovered for a brief time against the Euro, Yen and  
other major currencies. These concerns soon abated, however, and the markets    
globally moved higher and the US dollar lower. Now these worries have been      
replaced in the Japanese and European markets by concerns that a strong         
currency will dampen economic growth.                                           
During the twelve months, the European BE 500 index increased by 8.1% in
local currency terms and the Japanese Nikkei 225 increased by 2.0% in local     
currency terms. The Euro increased by 10.4% against the US dollar as the        
growing trade imbalance and the large fiscal deficit in the US continued to     
undermine confidence in the dollar. During the period, certain foreign central  
banks began marginally to increase their purchases of Euros in lieu of dollars. 
The Japanese Yen increased by 3.8% against the US dollar, in spite of the       
Japanese Central Bank's persistent efforts to intervene to slow the Yen's       
appreciation. Asian markets were up 7.6% in US dollar terms. The EAFE           
outperformed the S&P 500 in US dollar terms by nearly 10%.                      
 During the period, we increased our holdings in Europe, where we continue
to discover highly cash-generative "old economy" companies, like dredging       
leader Boskalis Westminster, that are leaders in their respective markets and   
trade at depressed valuations. We also increased our holdings of undervalued    
"special situations", such as food ingredients company CSM, where there is a    
known catalyst for value realization. We decreased our exposure to Japan as     
certain of our holdings, such as Makita and Shimano, reached our valuation      
objectives, though we increased our exposure to domestic economy oriented       
stocks, such as security systems company Secom, that will benefit from a pickup 
in price inflation and consumer spending. We maintained a significant exposure  
to non-Japan Asia. Our strategy there includes purchasing stocks of non-Chinese 
companies that conduct a significant portion of their business in China, and    
are characterized by more attractive valuations and stronger corporate          
governance than their Chinese peers.                                            
   Looking forward, we are as concerned as ever about the global imbalances we
have cited during the last two years. To recap, we believe that growth in the   
US has been achieved in part through massive monetary and fiscal stimulation,   
which should produce higher interest rates, with negative implications for      
consumer behavior, equity valuations and the US dollar. We expect that the      
Asian currencies, which tend to be US dollar linked and have depreciated        
against the European currencies, will be pressured to revalue upward. This,     
however, will not correct the US current account deficit, which will only be    
remedied by a reduction of US domestic consumption. As growth in the US slows,  
it will become more challenging for companies that export to the US to generate 
growth in earnings and cash flow. However, in our view, the challenges posed by 
stronger domestic currencies in Japan and Europe will provide added impetus to  
the economic reforms and corporate restructuring activities that we have noted  
in recent years. This in turn will continue to create good investment           
opportunities for disciplined, value-oriented investors. Regardless of what     
might happen in the US, we do expect that Asia, and in particular China, will   
continue to grow well, with domestic demand comprising an ever larger part of   
that growth.                                                                    
In general, we expect the non-US markets to benefit from improving      
corporate governance and management practices, the development of local equity  
cultures, declining macroeconomic risk premiums and positive capital flows.     
Against this background, inefficient pricing of equities, particularly among    
small and mid-cap companies, can provide exceptional opportunities. We continue 
to employ our investment discipline, seeking to discover fundamentally          
attractive companies that are out of favor and undervalued, and to provide our  
shareholders with above average returns with below average risk.                

Respectfully,

The Tocqueville Gold Fund                                                       

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Fellow Shareholder,                                                        

  2004 was a year of consolidation in a secular bull market for gold. Over the
past twelve months (October 31, 2003-October 31, 2004), gold bullion has        
increased 11.53% in US dollar terms, while the total return of the XAU          
benchmark index (Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index) was 6.54%.  
The S&P 500 return for the twelve-month period ended October 31, 2004 was       
9.42%. Over the same twelve months, the total return of The Tocqueville Gold    
Fund was 2.03%. During the previous two years ended October 31, 2003, the total 
return of gold mining shares (XAU) outperformed that of metal by a substantial  
margin, rising 85.96% vs. 37.40%.                                               
Although the Fund has outperformed its benchmark index (XAU) by a         
substantial amount over the last three fiscal years ended October 31, 2004      
(183.67% vs. 98.12%), we slightly under performed (2.03% vs. 6.54%) in the most 
recent fiscal year. The reason for this lag was our over weighting of the South 
African shares, which under performed due to the exceptionally strong Rand.     
 Prominent among last year's developments was the significant decline in the
trade-weighted dollar. It is currently trading at the lowest level since 1995   
(81.26) as of this writing, down by 33% vs. its peak of 121.02 in 2002.         
However, this index only reflects the dollar's exchange value against the Yen,  
Euro, and other floating currencies. It does not reflect its value against      
those currencies that are pegged to the dollar, including the Chinese Renminbi, 
the Indian Rupee, and other important Asian currencies. Conventional analysis   
would have us believe that dollar weakness will correct the massive trade       
imbalances between the US and the rest of the world. As long as there is no     
upward adjustment of the Asian currencies where the largest balance of payments 
deficits exist, this conventional wisdom does not appear to hold true. A weak   
dollar against the Euro and Yen is unlikely to remedy the unbridled export of   
US dollars in return for goods and services provided to the American consumer   
by Asia.                                                                        
Confusion over this issue has led in part to the cooption of gold as a    
surrogate for the Euro by the typical trading desk. This explains the           
correlation between the Euro and gold versus the US dollar. From December of    
2002 to September of 2004, the Euro rose approximately 16% against the dollar   
while gold rose approximately 18%. However, since September of 2004, gold began 
to outperform the Euro vs. the dollar, and on December 14, 2004 gold is trading 
at 328 Euros/ounce. Gold needs only to trade above 350 Euros to break out, as   
it has already done in Yen.                                                     
We believe a Euro/gold breakout would signify that the bull market in gold
has shifted to a higher gear, and that the Euro is just another paper currency  
with as many or more flaws than the US dollar. A Euro/gold breakout will likely 
herald the rise of gold against all forms of paper assets, which it has been    
doing in stealth fashion since 1999. Money flows into gold and gold shares,     
halting and skeptical during the past five years, should expand dramatically.   
At this point, gold should outperform all other currencies as well as so called 
"hard asset" plays.                                                             
The newly introduced gold ETF on the NYSE (ticker-GLD) should facilitate  
money flows into physical metal. GLD is a grantor trust backed by physical      
gold. When a new share is created, the dealer group must purchase physical gold 
to back it. The gold is held in a London vault. In the past, price quotes for   
gold were primarily for paper derivatives of the real thing, primarily futures  
contracts or gold linked notes issued by money center banks.                    
It would not take much of a diversion of capital from paper assets to     
physical gold to drive the price well into 4-digit territory. Global financial  
assets exceed $70 trillion. The market cap of physical gold, assuming all       
central bank gold is for sale (which it is not) is around $1 trillion. If 1/10% 
of global financial assets chose to migrate to physical gold, it would          
represent a call on two years of global mine production. That trade would be    
impossible to execute at current prices. Of course, the real market cap of      
gold, taking central bank reserves out of the picture, is substantially less    
than $1 trillion. It is worth noting than in previous bear markets for paper    
assets, the ratio of gold to paper was not 1 to 70, but 1 to 4 (1980) and 1 to  
5 (1932). Backup math for all of this is contained in our recent paper,         
Beardlsey Ruml's Road to Ruin, that is posted on our website,                   
www.tocqueville.com.                                                            
  While these calculations may be of some interest, they are irrelevant unless
investors desire to transfer some portion of their wealth from paper to         
tangible assets. Let me suggest a few reasons why this could happen. Financial  
assets are generally overvalued. Bonds, with yields at historically low levels  
due to irresponsible monetary policy, stand at the precipice of a secular bear  
market. The overvalued dollar results in global financial imbalances that are   
unsustainable. When the rest of the world decides to stop buying US paper, the  
US government and American consumers will have to become self-financing. Rising 
interest rates and rising inflation will be inescapable. What will that do to   
equity market valuations? Nothing good, I can assure you. This is a very short  
list as to why safety-seeking capital might find its way into gold over the     
next several years.                                                             
Global monetary authorities have skillfully deferred a reckoning for the  
trillions of dollars of capital misdirected by the mispricing of interest rates 
and currencies over the past two decades. Their heroic feats will ultimately be 
in vain, as market forces prevail in the end. One is always entitled to hope    
for a "muddle through" scenario, but the resolution of financial excesses and   
imbalances has historically involved some pain. We should hope for the best,    
but in case those hopes are disappointed, some exposure to gold seems like a    
good idea.                                                                      
  We appreciate your support and interest over the past year. We will continue
to work diligently to make sure that The Tocqueville Gold Fund continues to     
provide exposure to the opportunities we foresee for the gold sector.           

Sincerely,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Fellow Shareholder,                                                        

 The Tocqueville Genesis Fund, during the twelve months ending October 31,
2004, generated a total return of 1.6%. For the same period the Dow Jones       
Wilshire 5000 had a total return of 10.0%. We remain below our benchmark        
primarily due to substantial cash levels, abiding by our plan to use these      
resources at lower prices anticipated later in the year. Recall that this is    
our first full year, and that we have invested our cash cautiously throughout   
the year. In the coming 12 months I would expect results to reflect a more      
fully invested portfolio.                                                       
  A year ago, you may recall that our perspective on the market, while being
positive long-term, was a bit more defensive than normal as the year began. As  
expected, market action tried the patience of most investors across more than a 
few sectors. The lows for the year were reached in August when the fund hit a   
low point of 9.65 per share, down 3.5% from its offering price. We viewed this  
as an opportunity to utilize our large cash reserve. Going into August, the     
fund had in excess of 60% of its assets in cash. As we ended October, that cash 
level was more than cut in half. Equity exposure increased from 40% of the      
portfolio to over 70%.                                                          
My sense today is that the consensus viewpoint for 2005 appears to be   
almost exactly opposite of that when 2004 dawned. Then, most investors around   
the globe saw few problems and expected prices to continue to move higher than  
at the pace seen in 2003. As the year wore on, historically low interest rates  
created huge channels of liquidity and drove demand higher--followed by raw     
materials cost increases. The growing concern of rapidly rising oil prices      
added to other pressures and the result was several months of difficult market  
conditions, capped within the longest running trade range seen in the last 80   
years. Now, as we plan for 2005, the crowd is full of concern, swamped by bad   
headlines and negative news. The search for opportunity seems to be abandoned   
by most investors in the face of dire predictions about our collective futures. 
To control risk, the number of positions in our portfolio remains       
relatively high. My work suggests that market conditions, while unfolding as    
expected and beginning to improve, are likely to provide a few more bouts of    
weakness as the data on growth builds for a better 2005. This improvement is    
more likely to be apparent as we approach the latter stages of Q2 as earnings   
reports may then be set to exceed reduced expectations. We anticipate using the 
next two quarters to pare the number of positions and build depth in the        
sectors that we believe are showing better relative strength and stronger       
performance on the fundamental corporate level. As such, one should expect to   
see the portfolio move from one with shallow levels of ownership in many        
companies to one with deeper levels of commitment in fewer companies.           
Current market conditions are focused on two extremes--with the data    
hinting that both are near a turning point. On the plus side is the extreme     
level of enthusiasm for anything oil-related. Crude oil markets have seen much  
press this year and it has become obvious to many that gains are assured. As    
such, we continue to tread lightly in that sector even though we expect the     
shakeout to yield opportunity for positioning longer-term on those setbacks. On 
the other extreme, the negative bias toward technology appears to be taking     
hold as a final acceptance that tech is like any other sector: it does not grow 
to the sky. Downgrades have been rampant in recent weeks. Consequently, we feel 
the longer-term investor can now find opportunity to build positions in this    
sector for better performance in 2005 and beyond.                               
Another wild card now is the U.S. dollar. While my reviews suggest that 
momentum and the speculative nature of markets may bring about some additional  
weakness near-term, we feel that the seeds of the next wave of opportunity are  
being planted as the press focus on this issue reaches its zenith. We believe   
that the dollar weakness concern of today will become a growth and demand       
opportunity later in 2005. As such, we will seek to continue using weak periods 
to build in sectors that should benefit from this shift.                        
 However frustrating our first 12-month period of fund activity has proven
to be, I am confident that our choice to take a slow path to full investment in 
the Fund has helped us to sidestep major portions of the choppy environment     
experienced in fiscal 2004 and to position in the sectors we feel are set to    
surprise on the growth side for 2005 and beyond. I thank you for the            
opportunity to serve your investment needs and to work prudently toward your    
goals. Our journey together is still very young. While the path before us will  
undoubtedly have a few bumps, I believe that the current fear-laced environment 
will again prove to be exaggerated. As this becomes evident, the steps we will  
take to build positions during the first two quarters of 2005 will help us      
prepare for that improving recognition.                                         

Respectfully,

  Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment returns
and principal value will fluctuate and the investor's share, when redeemed, may 
be worth more or less than their original cost. You should consider the         
investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of each Fund before          
investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Funds   
and you should read it carefully before investing.                              

   Each Fund's holdings are also subject to change without notice. The mention
of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation for any person   
to buy, sell or hold any mentioned security. The securities mentioned in the    
articles are not representative of each Fund's entire portfolio.                

  There are special risks associated with investing in small cap and mid cap
stocks, including: small and mid cap companies rely on limited product lines,   
financial resources and business activities that may make them more susceptible 
than larger companies to setbacks or downturns; and small and mid cap companies 
are less liquid and more thinly traded which make them more volatile than       
stocks or larger companies.                                                     

There are special risks associated with investing in foreign securities,
including: the value of foreign currencies may decline relative to the US       
dollar; a foreign government may expropriate a Fund's assets; and political,    
social or economic instability in a foreign country in which a Fund invests may 
cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline.                           

The Tocqueville Gold Fund is subject to special risks associated with   
investing in gold and other precious metals, including: the price of            
gold/precious metals may be subject to wide fluctuations; the market for        
gold/precious metals is relatively limited; the sources of gold/precious metals 
are concentrated in countries that have the potential for instability; and the  
market for gold/precious metals is unregulated. In addition, there are special  
risks associated with investing in foreign securities, including: the value of  
foreign currencies may decline relative to the US dollar; a foreign government  
may expropriate the Fund's assets; and political, social or economic            
instability in a foreign country in which the Fund invests may cause the value  
of the Fund's investments to decline.                                           

   The Tocqueville Genesis Fund has a sales charge (load) that is a percentage
of the purchase, and that is levied at the time of purchase; such percentage    
varies with the amount of purchase in accordance with breakpoints. Please see   
the prospectus for information regarding the breakpoints and letters of intent  
that may affect the fees charged.

Expense Example--October 31, 2004                                               

  As a shareholder of The Tocqueville Trust (the "Funds"), you incur ongoing
costs, including management fees; distribution fees; and other expenses of the  
Funds. This example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in   
dollars) of investing in the Funds and to compare costs with the ongoing costs  
of investing in other mutual funds.                                             

 The Example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning
of the period and held for the entire period (May 1, 2004-October 31, 2004).    

Actual Expenses                                                                 

The first line of the table provides information about actual account   
values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together  
with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the   
period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600      
account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number  
in the first line under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to   
estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.              

Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes                                    

The second line of the table provides information about hypothetical    
account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Funds' actual expense     
ratios and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is   
not the Funds' actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may  
not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid  
for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of    
investing in the Funds and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical  
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder        
reports of other funds.                                                         

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight 
your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as     
sales charges (loads), redemption fees, or exchange fees. Therefore, the second 
line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help  
you determine the relative costs of owning different funds. In addition, if     
these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

Notes to Financial Statements 

1.  ORGANIZATION                                                                

The Tocqueville Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Massachusetts    
business trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended  
(the "1940 Act"), as a diversified, open-end management investment company. The 
Trust consists of five separate funds: The Tocqueville Fund, The Tocqueville    
Small Cap Value Fund, The Tocqueville International Value Fund, The Tocqueville 
Gold Fund and The Tocqueville Genesis Fund (individually referred to as the     
''Fund'' and collectively referred to as the ''Funds''). The objective of The   
Tocqueville Fund is long-term capital appreciation. The Tocqueville Fund seeks  
to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in securities of     
United States issuers. The objective of The Tocqueville Small Cap Value Fund is 
long-term capital appreciation. The Tocqueville Small Cap Value Fund seeks to   
achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets,   
plus borrowings for investment purposes, in common stocks of companies located  
in the United States that have market values of less than $1 billion. The       
objective of The Tocqueville International Value Fund is long-term capital      
appreciation consistent with preservation of capital. The Tocqueville           
International Value Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing 
primarily in non-U.S. companies. The objective of The Tocqueville Gold Fund is  
to provide long-term capital appreciation. The Tocqueville Gold Fund seeks to   
achieve its investment objective by investing 80% of its net assets, plus       
borrowings for investment purposes, in gold and securities of companies located 
throughout the world that are engaged in mining or processing gold. The         
objective of The Tocqueville Genesis Fund is long-term capital appreciation     
consistent with preservation of capital. The Tocqueville Genesis Fund seeks to  
achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in securities of United 
States issuers. Shares of The Tocqueville Genesis Fund are subject to an        
initial sales charge imposed at the time of purchase, in accordance with the    
Fund's prospectus. The maximum sales charge is 5.00% of the offering price. The 
following is a summary of significant accounting principles followed by the     
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.                           

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                             

a) Security valuation                                                           

Investments in securities, including foreign securities, traded on an   
exchange or quoted on the over-the-counter market are valued at the last sale   
price or, if no sale occurred during the day, at the mean between closing bid   
and asked prices, as last reported by a pricing service approved by the         
Trustees. Securities that are principally traded on the National Association of 
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation ("NASDAQ") National Market are generally 
valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP"). Precious metals are       
valued at the mean between closing bid and asked prices based on dealer or      
exchange quotes. When market quotations are not readily available, or when      
restricted securities or other assets are being valued, such assets are valued  
at fair value as determined in good faith by or under procedures approved by    
the Trustees. Short-term securities maturing within 60 days are valued on an    
amortized cost basis. Fixed income securities with maturities greater than 60   
days are valued at market price.                                                

Trading in securities on European and Far Eastern securities exchanges  
normally is completed before the calculation of the Fund's net asset value.     
Trading on these foreign exchanges may not take place on all days on which      
there is regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), or may take   
place on days on which there is no regular trading on the NYSE. Similarly, the  
Fund may hold securities traded on domestic markets where the market may close  
early on a given day prior to calculation of the Fund's net asset value. Events 
affecting the value of such securities held by a Fund that occur between the    
close of trading in the security and the close of trading on the NYSE normally  
will not be reflected in the Fund's calculation of the net asset value.         
Significant events will be closely monitored, and where it is determined        

                                                                [Download Table]

that an adjustment should be made to the security's value because significant   
intervening events have caused a Fund's net asset value to be materially        
inaccurate, the security will be priced at its fair value in accordance with    
the procedures approved by the Trustees.                                        

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) Restricted and Illiquid Securities                                           

   The Tocqueville Fund and The Tocqueville Gold Fund may invest in securities
that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale or are          
illiquid. A security may be considered illiquid if it lacks a readily available 
market or if its valuation has not changed for a certain period of time.        
Disposal of these securities may involve time consuming negotiations and        
expense, and prompt sale at the current valuation may be difficult.             

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c) Federal income tax                                                           

  Provision for federal income taxes or excise taxes has not been made since
the Funds have elected to be taxed as "regulated investment companies" and      
intend to distribute substantially all taxable income to shareholders and       
otherwise comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to 
regulated investment companies. Distributions from net realized gains for book  
purposes may include short-term capital gains which are included as ordinary    
income to shareholders for tax purposes. Accounting principles generally        
accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires that permanent       
differences between financial reporting and tax reporting be reclassified

   Unrealized appreciation and depreciation differ for financial statement and
tax purposes primarily due to the tax deferral of wash sale losses (The         
Tocqueville Gold Fund and The Tocqueville Genesis Fund only) and realization    
for tax purposes of unrealized losses on passive foreign investment companies   
(The Tocqueville Gold Fund only).

                            -----------  ----------  

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004, The Tocqueville Fund, The
Tocqueville International Value Fund and The Tocqueville Genesis Fund utilized  
$3,325,138, $20,909,375 and $126 of capital loss carryforwards, respectively.   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
d) Foreign currency translation                                                 

Investments and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign     
currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at the prevailing rates of exchange,  
in accordance with the Trust's Portfolio Securities Valuation Procedures. The   
Tocqueville Fund, The Tocqueville International Value Fund, The Tocqueville     
Gold Fund, and The Tocqueville Genesis Fund are engaged in transactions in      
securities denominated in foreign currencies and, as a result, enter into       
foreign exchange                                                                

                                                                [Download Table]

contracts. These Funds are exposed to additional market risk as a result of     
changes in the value of the underlying currency in relation to the U.S. dollar. 
Risks include potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their  
contracts. The value of foreign currency contracts are marked-to-market on a    
daily basis, which reflects the changes in the market value of the contract at  
the close of each day's trading, resulting in daily unrealized gains and/or     
losses. When the contracts are closed, the Funds recognize a realized gain or   
loss.                                                                           

The Funds do not isolate that portion of the results of operations      
resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the        
fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such     
fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss     
from investments.                                                               

  Reported net realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of
foreign currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and     
settlement dates on securities transactions, the differences between the        
amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the   
Fund's books, and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received   
or paid. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in 
the value of assets and liabilities other than investments in securities at the 
end of the fiscal period, resulting from changes in the exchange rates.         

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e) Written option accounting                                                    

   The Tocqueville International Value Fund, The Tocqueville Gold Fund and The
Tocqueville Genesis Fund may write (sell) covered call options to hedge         
portfolio investments. When the Funds write (sell) an option, an amount equal   
to the premium received by the Funds are included in the Statements of Assets   
and Liabilities as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the      
liability is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the  
option written. By writing an option, the Funds may become obligated during the 
term of the option to deliver or purchase the securities underlying the option  
at the exercise price if the option is exercised. Option contracts are valued   
at the last sales price reported on the date of valuation. If no sale is        
reported, the option contract written is valued at the average of the current   
bid and asked price reported on the day of valuation. When an option expires on 
its stipulated expiration date or the Funds enter into a closing purchase       
transaction, the Funds realize a gain or loss if the cost of the closing        
purchase transaction differs from the premium received when the option was sold 
without regard to any unrealized gain or loss on the underlying security, and   
the liability related to such option is eliminated. When an option is           
exercised, the premium originally received decreases the cost basis of the      
security (or increases the proceeds on a sale of the security), and the Funds   
realize a gain or loss from the sale of the underlying security.                

Written option activity for the year ended October 31, 2004 for The     
Tocqueville Genesis Fund was as follows:

f) Futures Contracts                                                            

 Futures contracts listed for trading on a securities exchange or board of
trade shall be valued at the last quoted sales price, or in the absence of a    
sale, the mean of the last bid and asked prices. When a Fund enters into a      
futures contract, it makes an initial margin deposit in a segregated account,   
either in cash or liquid securities. Thereafter, the futures contract is marked 
to market and the Fund makes (or receives) additional cash payments daily to    
(or from) the broker. Changes in the value of the contract are recorded as      
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the contract is closed or settled, 
at which time a realized gain or loss is recognized.                            

At October 31, 2004 The Tocqueville Genesis Fund had entered into stock 
index futures contracts. The net unrealized depreciation is included in the     
appreciation/depreciation section of the accompanying financial statements. The 
terms of the open contracts are as follows:                                     

                                            Value as of   Unrealized

g) Use of Estimates                                                             

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting   
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires          
management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts   
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities   
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases   
and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.                                      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
h) Other                                                                        

Investments and shareowner transactions are recorded on trade date.     
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date or for foreign securities   
for which timely information is not available, when the Funds first learn of    
the dividend, whichever is earlier. Interest income is recognized on the        
accrual basis and market discount is accounted for on a yield to maturity basis 
from settlement date. The Funds use the first-in, first-out method for          
determining realized gain or loss on investments sold for both financial        
reporting and federal tax purposes. The Funds may be subject to foreign taxes   
on income, gains on investments or currency repatriation, a portion of which    
may be recoverable. The Funds will accrue such taxes and recoveries as          
applicable, based upon their current interpretation of tax rules and            
regulations that exist in the markets in which it invests. Distributions to     
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Expenses incurred by the     
Trust not specifically identified to a Fund are allocated on a basis relative   
to the size of each Fund's daily net asset value. It is the Trust's policy to   
take possession of securities as collateral under repurchase agreements and to  
determine on a daily basis that the value of such securities are sufficient to  
cover the value of the repurchase agreements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm                         

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of                                    
The Tocqueville Trust:                                                      

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities,  
including the schedules of investments, and the related statements of           
operations and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present    
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Tocqueville     
Fund, The Tocqueville Small Cap Value Fund, The Tocqueville International Value 
Fund, The Tocqueville Gold Fund, and The Tocqueville Genesis Fund (all five     
constituting The Tocqueville Trust, hereafter referred to as the "Funds") at    
October 31, 2004, the results of their operations for the year then ended, the  
changes in each of their net assets and the financial highlights for each of    
the periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally       
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and        
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the  
responsibility of the Funds' management; our responsibility is to express an    
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our     
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the    
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards      
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit    
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles    
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall   
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included    
confirmation of securities at October 31, 2004 by correspondence with the       
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Certain de minimis exceptions are allowed for non-audit services in accordance  
with Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X as set forth in the registrant's

provides ongoing services to the registrant for the fiscal year ended October

were billed by the registrant's accountant for services rendered to (i) the     
registrant, and (ii) the registrant's investment adviser and any control person 
of the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for the fiscal  
year ended October 31, 2003 were $0 and $25,000, respectively.

4(h) The registrant's audit committee has considered whether its principal      
accountant's provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the          
registrant's investment adviser, and any control persons of the investment      
adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant, that were not         
pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.
