Strategy and process

Tax-advantaged income: The fund offers Massachusetts residents the potential for high current income that is free from federal income tax and Massachusetts State personal income taxes.
Focus on performance: The portfolio managers seek to provide a competitive yield through a combination of careful security selection and portfolio construction strategies.
A high-quality portfolio: A diversified portfolio of low-risk, high-quality investments enables the managers to pursue current income while maintaining a relatively stable share value.



 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.



Objective
The fund seeks as high a level of current income exempt from federal income tax and personal income tax (if any) of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as we believe is consistent with preservation of capital.

Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge
relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as
determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future
results.


The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The ratio is
calculated by dividing the manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the up-market, and multiplying that factor by 100. The down-market capture ratio
is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The ratio is calculated by dividing the
manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the down-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

The unclassified sector (where applicable) includes exchange traded funds and other securities not able to be classified by sector.
Sectors will vary over time. Represents the equity portion of the portfolio.



Fund characteristics will vary over time.
Due to rounding, percentages may not equal 100%.


 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.

The Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index is an unmanaged index of long-term fixed-rate investment-grade tax-exempt bonds. You cannot invest directly in an index.
 Consider these risks before investing: Bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons, including general financial market conditions, changing market perceptions of the risk of default, changes in government intervention in the financial markets, and factors related to a specific issuer. These factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets. Single-state investments are at risk of common economic forces and other factors affecting a state's tax-exempt investments. This may result in greater losses and volatility. Capital gains, if any, are taxed at the federal and, in most cases, state levels. For some investors, investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate risk (the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise) and credit risk (the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments). Interest-rate risk is greater for longer-term bonds, and credit risk is greater for below-investment-grade bonds. Unlike bonds, funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses. Tax-exempt bonds may be issued under the Internal Revenue Code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects. As a result, the fund's investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund. Interest the fund receives might be taxable. You can lose money by investing in the fund.
Credit qualities are shown as a percentage of net assets. A bond rated BBB or higher (SP-3 or higher, for short-term debt) is considered investment grade. This chart reflects the highest security rating provided by one or more of Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Short-term cash bonds are included in the cash and net other assets category. Ratings and portfolio credit quality will vary over time. Derivative instruments, including currency forwards, are only included to the extent of any unrealized gain or loss on such instruments and are shown in the cash and net other assets category. Cash is also shown in the cash and net other assets category. The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

Intuitive Search
Find the right results faster than ever before

          Checkpoint Catalyst features Intuitive Search, a multi-layered approach that goes beyond keyword 
          matching to understand and interpret what you’re really looking for in your search.
        

          We’ve combined three key aspects of the search equation to ensure that the most applicable document 
          to your search will show up at the top of your result list every time.
        



 Intuitive search on Checkpoint. Find it. Faster. (2:36)




Search the Way You Think

          Simply enter a terms and connectors, natural language, or citation search, and the enhanced search 
        capability of Checkpoint Catalyst’s Intuitive Search will return the most relevant results for the terms 
        you entered — no matter how you structure your search.
        


Easily Navigate Search Results

          Our simplified results display makes it easy to skim and interpret results to get the most useful 
        information quickly. We’ve enhanced our interface with a cleaner look and feel, resulting in minimal 
        scrolling and fewer clicks. We also highlight keyword matches to make the strength of relevance easy 
        to identify.
        


Source List Display
Source List Display flags sources with a green star to show they contain a result that is in the 
        top 10 hits for relevancy. You can expand and collapse each source to see the three most relevant 
        documents within — to quickly scan and select the best match for your research.
        






Triple-Powered Relevancy

  Technical Innovation


          Checkpoint Catalyst Intuitive Search applies layers of analysis to filter, rank, 
          and deliver the best results across all of your Checkpoint libraries with unprecedented 
          levels of accuracy.
        

  Editorial Expertise


          Checkpoint Catalyst Intuitive Search makes use of the cross references and “equivalency 
          tables” created by our editorial experts to bring back documents related to your keywords. 
          You won’t need to think about alternative search terms because we’ve already done it for you.
        

  User Behavior


          Checkpoint Catalyst Intuitive Search uses built-in intelligence that continuously “learns” 
          from user selections and preferences — getting smarter while you work.
        









Multi-Jurisdictional Analysis
Highlighting Federal, State and US International tax implications

          State, Federal and U.S. International tax implications are covered as part of the main topic 
          discussion, reducing the risk that something important could be missed and saving research steps.
        





        The charts can be opened and closed from directly within this main content set, so you never have 
          to leave the page you’re on. These embedded tools are a unique feature of the Checkpoint Catalyst 
          library and help you zero-in on the state-related tax implications you need to know.    
        

       The Sales and Use Tax Treatment of Section 351 Exchanges is an example of an inline tool that will 
          expand directly within your Checkpoint Catalyst Library.     
        








Unparalleled Insights
The most trusted and relevant content delivered with key insights
Checkpoint Catalyst covers a wide range of tax topics and provides strategic insights, crafted by 
	authoritative tax experts to give you all the right information at the right time.
      





With Checkpoint Catalyst, you’ll have the power to:


          Form the most complete recommendation for your clients or company with 
          related content that’s always presented in the context of the topic.
        

          Identify potential risks with multi-jurisdictional content that highlights 
          the state, federal and U.S. international tax implications on a topic.
        

          Understand the logic behind the tax code with practical, real-life examples 
          that are embedded throughout to help you take the next step.
        

          Stay abreast of the latest tax news with our featured developments tool 
          that includes relevant news articles displayed within the relevant topic or 
          sub topic.
        










Embedded Workflow Tools
Helping you find answers fast and take action

          Checkpoint Catalyst covers a wide range of tax topics and provides strategic insights,
          crafted by authoritative tax experts to give you all the right information at the right time.
        





        You’ll save time and reduce frustration with the ability to make use of embedded tools such as document 
        assembly, decision trees, and what-if scenarios that allow you to apply the rules to your particular situation.    
        

        After you have researched one business transaction, it will take less time to complete similar transactions in 
        the future — put those time savings towards higher revenue-generating opportunities!     
        







Context Panel
Bring content to life with our insight-packed Context Panel
Checkpoint Catalyst introduces an inventive Context Panel, an insight-rich sidebar on the right-hand side 
      of your screen. The Context Panel brings the research content to life by providing relevant documents, sources, 
      news and tools, and also allows for an easy navigation point.
      





 Contents

          State tax implications of a given tax issue can be immediately accessed by navigating an outline of the topic 
          in the Context Panel.
        
 Featured Developments

          All the news you need on a topic, all in one place. Daily tax developments are included in the Context Panel 
          so you can view developments directly in context to the topic you’re reviewing.
        
 Tools

          Tools and Practice Aids that are relevant to a topic can be used to immediately put your knowledge into practice.

          easy access to multiple opinions and perspectives on a given topic.

The Whole Picture
Checkpoint Catalyst is the fastest, most efficient way to research even the most complicated tax issues.

          Checkpoint Catalyst delivers so much more than any other type of online research library, it’s in a 
          category of its own. As the next generation of online tax research, Checkpoint Catalyst is the first product 
          of its kind to be created specifically for the web—not designed and formatted for print.
        

          Now, you can get the whole picture of a topic—with sources, diagrams, interactive tools and featured 
          developments that come together in context, all on one screen.
        



  Experience the Difference. (2:36) 




Highlights





Topics can be expanded or collapsed, simultaneously facilitating quick 
            lookups and detailed research.




Interactive tools, diagrams, and decision trees are embedded directly 
            within the workflow, taking you from question, to answer, to action.




Statements are supported by authority, making it extremely easy to read the underlying 
            primary sources.






State tax implications and U.S. international tax 
                implications are discussed directly within the 
                topic— saving research steps and reducing the 
                risk that something important could be missed.




Recent tax developments and other noteworthy 
                news articles are presented in context of the topic
                to keep you up-to-date on important developments 
                or provide a quick refresher on recent changes.




Each topic has a clear date-marker so that there’s 
                no uncertainty about when the content was last 
                reviewed or updated.




 



Topic Coverage
Examine specific tax issues and business transactions from a practical, workflow perspective

          Checkpoint Catalyst is a collection of topics that examine specific tax issues and business transactions from a practical, workflow perspective focusing on:

S Corporations, Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies
Tax Accounting
Cost Recovery
Sales and Exchanges
State Specific Topics
Consolidated Groups
Investments
International (U.S. Income Tax)
Learn about our US GAAP coverage on revenue recognition, leasing and more


Contact us for more details or to request a demo›




          Topics can be expanded or collapsed to provide a landscape perspective on a topic, as well as the ability to drill 
          down into detail depending on the needs of the user. This web focus simultaneously facilitates quick lookups and 
          detailed research.
        










Amplify Your Checkpoint Library
Get even more out of your Checkpoint experience

          Checkpoint Catalyst can be used to support tax planning and transactional work. Its unique 
          design amplifies the value of your existing Checkpoint research library by bringing relevant 
          content together so that related resources within your subscriptions can immediately be viewed 
          in context of the topic—reducing the chance that something important could be missed.
        

          Easily go to other sources within the Checkpoint content library to cross-check the discussion. 
          This is particularly important when a topic of law is developing and you are looking for a consensus 
          view about a tax implication.

Intuitive Search
Find the right results faster than ever before

          Checkpoint Catalyst features Intuitive Search, a multi-layered approach that goes beyond keyword 
          matching to understand and interpret what you’re really looking for in your search.
        

          We’ve combined three key aspects of the search equation to ensure that the most applicable document 
          to your search will show up at the top of your result list every time.
        



 Intuitive search on Checkpoint. Find it. Faster. (2:36)




Search the Way You Think

          Simply enter a terms and connectors, natural language, or citation search, and the enhanced search 
        capability of Checkpoint Catalyst’s Intuitive Search will return the most relevant results for the terms 
        you entered — no matter how you structure your search.
        


Easily Navigate Search Results

          Our simplified results display makes it easy to skim and interpret results to get the most useful 
        information quickly. We’ve enhanced our interface with a cleaner look and feel, resulting in minimal 
        scrolling and fewer clicks. We also highlight keyword matches to make the strength of relevance easy 
        to identify.
        


Source List Display
Source List Display flags sources with a green star to show they contain a result that is in the 
        top 10 hits for relevancy. You can expand and collapse each source to see the three most relevant 
        documents within — to quickly scan and select the best match for your research.
        






Triple-Powered Relevancy

  Technical Innovation


          Checkpoint Catalyst Intuitive Search applies layers of analysis to filter, rank, 
          and deliver the best results across all of your Checkpoint libraries with unprecedented 
          levels of accuracy.
        

  Editorial Expertise


          Checkpoint Catalyst Intuitive Search makes use of the cross references and “equivalency 
          tables” created by our editorial experts to bring back documents related to your keywords. 
          You won’t need to think about alternative search terms because we’ve already done it for you.
        

  User Behavior


          Checkpoint Catalyst Intuitive Search uses built-in intelligence that continuously “learns” 
          from user selections and preferences — getting smarter while you work.
        









Multi-Jurisdictional Analysis
Highlighting Federal, State and US International tax implications

          State, Federal and U.S. International tax implications are covered as part of the main topic 
          discussion, reducing the risk that something important could be missed and saving research steps.
        





        The charts can be opened and closed from directly within this main content set, so you never have 
          to leave the page you’re on. These embedded tools are a unique feature of the Checkpoint Catalyst 
          library and help you zero-in on the state-related tax implications you need to know.    
        

       The Sales and Use Tax Treatment of Section 351 Exchanges is an example of an inline tool that will 
          expand directly within your Checkpoint Catalyst Library.

Helping you find answers fast and take action

          Checkpoint Catalyst covers a wide range of tax topics and provides strategic insights,
          crafted by authoritative tax experts to give you all the right information at the right time.
        





        You’ll save time and reduce frustration with the ability to make use of embedded tools such as document 
        assembly, decision trees, and what-if scenarios that allow you to apply the rules to your particular situation.    
        

        After you have researched one business transaction, it will take less time to complete similar transactions in 
        the future — put those time savings towards higher revenue-generating opportunities!

      of your screen. The Context Panel brings the research content to life by providing relevant documents, sources, 
      news and tools, and also allows for an easy navigation point.
