The St. Louis Trust Co.’s hiring of Julie Lilly, former chief operating officer of the Lewis Rice law firm, is part of a succession plan. Lilly, 47, executive vice president, joins John Jennings, 45, executive vice president, and Cece Strand, 46, senior vice president, as the next generation that will lead the firm, which manages more that $4 billion for 43 client families.
Although St. Louis Trust’s senior management has no immediate plans to retire, Jamie O’Connor, founder and CEO, is 67; Les Small, president, is 69; and Spencer Burke, executive vice president, also is 67.

Last month, Bob Holmes, managing director and head of regional banking at The PrivateBank, was named president and chief executive of Commerce Bank in St. Louis as part of a succession plan.




Holmes, 51, succeeds current St. Louis market President and Chief Operating Officer Jack Schreiber, 64, who plans to retire at the end of the year after 41 years in banking. He also will begin to assume some of the management responsibilities of Commerce Bancshares Inc. Vice Chairman Seth Leadbeater, 64, who plans to retire in 2016 after more than 25 years with the bank.

Greg Edwards covers banking and financial services.

HOW DO I AVOID RUINING MY KIDS?  5 THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN TEACHING YOUR KIDS ABOUT MONEY
Anna Bertman   | FAMILY OFFICE, ★ Featured   | 
								No Comments 

Families with significant wealth find that their wealth can solve problems, open doors, and provide security. But parents sometimes worry about “ruining” their kids when their children grow up in a privileged environment. We spend quite a lot of time working with our client families to prepare the next generation for the wealth that they will inherit – from basic financial literacy to fiduciary responsibility…












GIVE ME THE BEST (STRATEGY)
Alex Bates   | INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, ★ Featured   | 
								No Comments 

People are inclined to want the best. The best schools for their kids, the best home for their money, the best dish on the menu, and so on. This quest for the best also extends to the investment realm. People want to invest in the best opportunities to grow their money and achieve their wealth goals. Often times, we’re asked to find the best stock, investment manager, deal or “sure thing”…












SHOULD I SELL OUT OF THE STOCK MARKET?
John Jennings   | INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, ★ Featured   | 
								No Comments 

Over the past several months many people have asked whether they should take risk off the table by selling some of their stocks. Given the heightened perception of uncertainty in geopolitics and the financial markets, this question is understandable. In response, this article outlines investor concerns, examines various historical facts pertaining to investing in stocks and concludes with advice from The St. Louis Trust Company.
