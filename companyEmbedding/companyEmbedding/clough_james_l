JAMES HURDIS CLOUGH was born Nov. 14,
            1845, in Suffield, Hartford Co., Conn., and is a son of James Leonard

            who was also blind, and a musician and a teacher of note); (5) Elizabeth,
            born in 1815, died about 1842 in Michigan.
Alfred Sykes, the maternal grandfather

            military affairs. His father was Victory Sykes, and served in the
            Revolutionary army.
James H. Clough had his education

              up the work of life as an apprentice to the carpenter trade with
              A.B. West, of Hartford, Conn. While working at the bench Mr. Clough
              developed a talent for free hand drawing and architectural construction.
              He studied these subjects and after working at his trade three
              or four years decided to stop and devote some months to a more
              careful preparation in these lines. He went to Boston, where he
              entered the office of George F. Meacham as an architectural draftsman.
              For three years he was with Mr. Meacham and then began business
              on his own account. In 1872 he opened an office on Pemberton Square,
              as the junior member of Appleton, Stephenson & Clough. This
              business continued very successfully until 1879,
        when Mr. Cough was compelled to retire from the firm on account of ill
        health.
After his retirement, Mr. Clough came
            to Tolland and bought ten acres of his brother John E. Clough. There
            he has built a pleasant home and outbuildings, and has gone quite
            extensively into the greenhouse business. His flowers are readily
            sold in a number of Connecticut towns. This business venture has
            proved very successful. In 1901 he bought machinery for making baskets
            and is now carrying on the basket business also.
Mr. Clough was a charter member of
            the Tolland Grange, and is its present Master. Mrs. Clough is also
            a member of this same order. Mr. Clough is a Republican, though for
            a time he was active in the Prohibition party. He was elected justice
            of the peace in 1900.
Mr. Clough was married in Somerville,
            Mass., Jan. 12, 1871, to Abby Jane Arnold, a daughter of Andrew Smith
            and Emeline Eunice (Kempton) Arnold. Mrs. Clough's father in his
            active years was a saw mill owner. He enlisted in the 16th N.H.V.,
            Company I, Sept. 13, 1862, and was discharged Aug. 29, 1863. He died
            May 7, 1901, in Tolland, where her mother is now living. Mrs. Cloughs
            great-grandfather was a Revolutionary soldier who fought all through
            that war and was never injured by so much as a scratch.
Mr. and Mrs. Clough have had the following
            children: (1) Frank James, born Jan. 7, 1872, in Somerville, Mass.,
            married Maude Adell Perry, of Wollaston, Mass., Oct. 27, 1897, and
            is in business as a dealer in provisions in that city. They have
            one child, Alfred Arnold, born Oct. 21, 1898. (2) Burton Andrew,
            born March 20, 1873, in Somerville, Mass., married Miss Ellen Amanda
            Wolfe, of South Coventry, March 20, 1900. They have two children,
            Leonard A., born in Willimantic, April 17, 1901, and Alice L., born
            in South Coventry, Dec. 10, 1902. Burton A. is an electrician in
            the Willimantic Light Plant. (3) Harvey Burnett, born Aug. 21, 1881,
            in Tolland, graduated from Rockville High School, 1902, and is now
            at Amherst College. (4) Grace Emeline, born May 14, 1883, in Tolland.
Mr. Clough has made his own way in
            the world; he has applied himself closely to his work and has been
            a hard student all his life.
Mr. and Mrs. Clough are both members
            of the Methodist Church, and are devoted workers in that communion.
            Mrs. Clough is an earnest worker in the ladies aid society.
