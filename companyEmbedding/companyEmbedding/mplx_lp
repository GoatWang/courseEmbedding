About MPLX
































About MPLX
MPLX LP (MPLX) is a diversified, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in 2012 by Marathon Petroleum Corporation to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets. MPLX provides services in the midstream sector across the hydrocarbon value chain through the Logistics and Storage and Gathering and Processing segments.




LOGISTICS AND STORAGE
MPLX transports and stores crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon based products, primarily in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S. Assets consist of a network of crude oil and refined product pipeline systems, associated storage assets and an inland marine business.
MPLX owns, leases, operates or has interest in 3,500 miles of crude oil pipelines and 2,400 miles of light product pipelines. MPLX also has 59 owned and operated, one leased and two partially owned light product terminals as well as butane and NGL storage caverns.
MPLX’s marine transportation operations include 18 owned towboats as well as more than 200 owned and leased barges that transport refined products and crude oil on the Ohio, Mississippi and Illinois rivers and their tributaries and inter-coastal waterways.

 



GATHERING AND PROCESSING
MPLX operates several natural gas gathering systems in six states. The scope of gathering services provided depends on the composition of the raw or untreated gas at producer customers’ wellheads. MPLX’s natural gas processing complexes remove the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components from natural gas. MPLX currently operates natural gas processing complexes in the Marcellus shale, Utica shale, Appalachia region, and Southwest region.
Once natural gas has been processed at a natural gas processing complex, the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components, which have been extracted as a mixed natural gas liquid (NGL) stream, can be further separated into their component parts through the process of fractionation. Our NGL fractionation facilities separate the mixture of extracted NGLs into individual purity product components for end-use sale.
Assets include more than 5,600 miles of gas gathering and NGL pipelines, 55 gas processing complexes, 14 NGL fractionation facilities and two condensate stabilization facilities.

Through collaborative planning, we construct midstream infrastructure and provide unique solutions that are critical to the ongoing success of our producer customers’ development plans. As a result of delivering high-quality midstream services, MarkWest has been the top-rated midstream service provider since 2006 as determined by an independent research provider.
Increase Operating Cash Flow and Pursue Organic Growth Opportunities. We intend to increase operating cash flow by continuing to grow in our primary areas of operation to meet anticipated demand for additional midstream services. In addition, we intend to increase operating cash flow by evaluating and capitalizing on organic investment opportunities that may arise in our areas of operations and increasing the utilization of our existing facilities by providing additional services for new and existing customers. We will evaluate organic growth projects both within our geographic footprint as well as in new areas that we consider strategic. With the support of MPC as our sponsor, we have the ability to develop incremental infrastructure to support growth across the hydrocarbon value chain.
Grow through Acquisitions. In addition to the recently completed MarkWest Merger, we plan to continue pursuing acquisitions of complementary assets from MPC as well as third parties. We believe our sponsor will offer us the opportunity to acquire MLP-qualifying assets from its substantial portfolio of midstream assets. We may also pursue third party midstream acquisitions independently or with MPC that complement our existing geographic footprint or expand our activities into new areas.
Focus on Fee-Based Businesses. We are focused on generating stable cash flows by providing fee-based midstream services to our customers.
Sustain Long-Term Growth. Our goal is to maintain an attractive distribution growth profile over the long term. Since the Initial Offering, we have increased our distribution for 12 consecutive quarters, which represents a compound annual growth rate of 24 percent over the minimum quarterly distribution. We believe our growth plans along with the support of our sponsor provide multiple avenues to support our distribution growth profile over the long-term.
Maintain Safe and Reliable Operations. We believe that providing safe, reliable and efficient services is a key component in generating stable cash flows, and we are committed to maintaining and improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our operations. We intend to continue promoting a high standard for safety and environmental stewardship.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

MPLX LP
MPLX is a diversified, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in 2012 by MPC to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets. MPLX provides services in the midstream sector across the hydrocarbon value chain through the Logistics and Storage and Gathering and Processing segments.
Logistics and Storage
MPLX transports and stores crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products, primarily in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S. Assets consist of a network of crude oil and refined product pipeline systems, associated storage assets and an inland marine business.
MPLX owns, leases, operates or has interest in 3,500 miles of crude oil pipelines and 2,400 miles of light product pipelines. MPLX also has 59 owned and operated, one leased and two partially owned light product terminals as well as butane and NGL storage caverns.
MPLX’s marine transportation operations include 18 owned towboats as well as more than 200 owned and leased barges that transport refined products and crude oil on the Ohio, Mississippi and Illinois rivers and their tributaries and inter-coastal waterways.
Gathering and Processing
MPLX operates several natural gas gathering systems in six states. The scope of gathering services provided depends on the composition of the raw or untreated gas at producer customers’ wellheads.
MPLX’s natural gas processing complexes remove the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components from natural gas. MPLX currently operates natural gas processing complexes in the Marcellus shale, Utica shale, Appalachia region, and Southwest region.
Once natural gas has been processed at a natural gas processing complex, the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components, which have been extracted as a mixed NGL stream, can be further separated into their component parts through the process of fractionation. Our NGL fractionation   facilities separate the mixture of extracted NGLs into individual purity product components for end-use sale.
Assets include more than 5,600 miles of gas gathering and NGL pipelines, 55 gas processing complexes, 14 NGL fractionation facilities and two condensate stabilization facilities.
