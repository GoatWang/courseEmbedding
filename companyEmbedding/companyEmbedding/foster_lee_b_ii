A History of L.B. Foster Company
Lee B. Foster was only 20 years old when he 
							founded the company that bears his name. Financed in 
							1902 with a small $2500 loan from his father, L.B. 
							Foster Company has grown for more than a century to 
							become a leader in the manufacture, fabrication and 
							distribution of infrastructure products and 
							materials.
Foster began the company to 
							service a transportation need he recognized while 
							growing up around his father’s oil business in 
							Titusville, Pennsylvania. Lee saw that his father 
							received many inquiries from mines, logging camps, 
							and quarries about the availability of relay (used) 
							train rail. Because no truck transportation existed 
							at the time, permanent and temporary rail spurs were 
							the only means for transporting heavy materials to 
							and from jobsites near and far. New rail was costly 
							and Foster saw an opportunity to resell rail that 
							had been retrieved from abandoned and replaced 
							railroads and urban transit systems.
To encourage the sale of used material, Lee 
							Foster initiated a guarantee that set his firm apart 
							from others and contributed greatly to his success: 
							“If the material is not up to the standard 
							represented, ship it back and we will pay the 
							freight both ways.” This dedication to customer 
							satisfaction became a core company value and remains 
							today at the forefront of the L.B. Foster customer 
							service policy.
Lee’s success attracted the 
							notice of his three brothers, Reuben, Sydney and 
							Byron. All eventually joined the company and the 
							brothers worked well together. Lee changed his sole 
							proprietorship into a four-way partnership in 1918. 
							L.B. Foster Company soon expanded with the opening 
							of new offices in New York City in 1922 and Chicago 
							four years later. The company began trading publicly 
							on the NASDAQ stock exchange (FSTR) in 1981.
In addition to transportation products, L.B. 
							Foster Company began to focus on other 
							infrastructure-related industries for new expansion. 
							Today the company markets its products to businesses 
							involved in transportation, construction, energy, 
							utility, recreation and agriculture.
Lee B. 
							Foster II, the founder’s grandson, managed the 
							company as President and Chief Executive Officer 
							from 1990 until 2002 and today serves as Chairman of 
							the Board. Mr. Foster provides a vital and ongoing 
							link between the company’s industrious past and its 
							current and future success.
In 1999 the 
							company acquired CXT Inc., a leading manufacturer of 
							engineered concrete products for railroad and 
							recreation markets. This acquisition positioned L.B. 
							Foster to better serve customers with a 
							comprehensive line of mainline, transit and 
							industrial rail products. The purchase of CXT also 
							expanded the company into the production of 
							recreational and multi-purpose precast concrete 
							buildings.
At the end of December 2010, L.B. 
							Foster acquired Portec Rail Products, Inc. and its 
							catalog of below the wheel rail items, worldwide 
							manufacturing facilities and knowledgeable 
							professional staff. Newly expanded L.B. Foster began 
							offering a larger line of rail products that 
							included new and relay rail, switches, track 
							lubricating equipment, spikes, anchors, fasteners, 
							concrete ties and wayside data collection systems. 
							The acquisition also provided the Rail Products 
							group with a larger international presence, expanded 
							customer support, additional R&D capabilities and 
							the well-earned goodwill of a century-old company.
As America has grown, L.B. Foster Company has 
							grown as well by providing the material necessary to 
							build and maintain our nation’s infrastructure. The 
							company’s products are currently being used for the 
							construction and rehabilitation of important 
							projects such as the New Orleans Flood Barrier, 
							Brooklyn Bridge and Panama Canal. As the world’s 
							infrastructure continues to expand, L.B. Foster will 
							be there with the products needed to build it 
							strong.

Take part in a legend with our diverse selection of Lee Jeans for women—they’ve been making fine denim for over a hundred years, so they know exactly what they’re doing. From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long. If you’re wanting to give those new boots a whirl around town, be sure to pick up a pair of dark indigo bootcut jeans to complement them. For looking hip and edgy, there’s nothing quite like a pair of skinny cut jeans with just the right amount of distressing for that lived-in look—then wear them with one of your sweet new infinity scarves and a pair of aviator sunglasses to complete your outfit!

Lee collection doesn’t stop a jeans. They have an exciting selection of cargo pants, trousers, and chinos. Their trousers and essential chinos are flattering cuts that will look great on any shape. They are the both work well for numerous occasions. The chinos in particular are excellent for casual events too!

Lee has over 100 years of stylish excellence under their belt. You won’t regret getting yourself a pair of Lee pants for women!

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
