RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif., July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Technical Institute (NYSE:    UTI) launched a new Welding Technology program at its Rancho Cucamonga campus.
Welders are increasingly in demand in industries ranging from automotive fabrication and motorsports to aerospace, energy and virtually every kind of manufacturing. Between 2014 and 2024 industry will need to fill more than 128,000 new and replacement positions.1 








"The Rancho Cucamonga campus is the first of multiple UTI campuses slated to launch the welding program as a part of UTI's strategy to grow our student population and serve industry's needs," said Roger Speer, Campus President and Regional Vice President. "At a time when our country has such a strong and growing demand for skilled professionals, the welding program gives students industry-aligned training and another promising career path." 
The 36-week program, built in collaboration with Lincoln Electric, a global leader in the welding industry, trains students for American Welding Society certification, and is approved by the California Bureau of Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE) and accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC). Courses will include Principles of Welding, Gas Metal and Shielded Metal Arc Welding, Pipe Welding, Safety, and more.

With the critical shortage of welders today, we accelerated our efforts to provide educators at every level with skills and knowledge that employers demand. We are excited to offer the UTI team our products, services and expertise to help develop an outstanding welding education program," said Jason Scales, manager, educational services, Lincoln Electric.
The Welding Technology program complements UTI's core automotive, diesel, motorcycle, marine and collision repair programs across the nation.
