Blood-based Biomarkers for Detection of early stage Alzheimer’s Disease:  A Successful Multi-Analyte Profiling Approach Ralph L. McDade, Ph.D. Strategic Development Officer 

The Myriad RBM Approach The Platform and Validation Success Stories Alzheimer’s Disease story 

Multi-Analyte Profile (MAP) 

The Myriad RBM Approach 

The Approach Pre-Clinical & Exploratory Phase II & Beyond Cast a wide net Target key markers 1 2 3 Start with a large Multi-Analyte Profile (MAP) biomarker panel Identify key biomarker patterns Develop a focused, custom panel One, validated, highly automated platform throughout drug development 

The Platform Industrialized form of Luminex xMAP All liquid handling steps automated using the Tecan Evo platform Proprietary blockers to handle most matrix effects Validated to clinical lab standards GLP and CLIA certified  56 successful regulatory compliance audits 

The object is to find a robust biomarker pattern These 13 analytes were found to discriminate responders from non-responders. 

Custom MAP Custom MAP 13-plex These 13 analytes were used to help the clinicians stratify clinical trial participants Simponi (golimumab ) 1. Adiponectin 2. EGF 3. Eotaxin 4. ICAM-1 5. IL-6 6. IL-10 7.IL-15 8.MCP-1 9.MMP-9 10.PAP 11.TNF-a 12.VEGF 13.von Willebrand Factor 

Cytokines  Acute- Phase Reactants Metabolic Markers Hormones Inflammatory markers Cardio- Vascular Cancer Markers Autoimmunity Core Competency – Immunoassay development in a multiplexed environment Assay Development Contracts EU/IMI NCI Psynova Genentech Novartis Eli Lilly Pfizer Amgen Merck Germany Merck U.S. Celgene AstraZeneca Centocor NIH Satoris BMS 

Validation Parameters Lowest Detectable Dose / LLOQ Normal Range Dynamic Range Imprecision Spiked Recovery Linearity Correlation Cross-reactivity Matrix Interferences Stability – Short term storage / Freeze-thaw CLIA GLP 

Just some of the over 400 users of this biomarker approach that have publicly acknowledged RBM success 

MRBM  that have publicly acknowledged RBM successBibliography: Publications Citing MAP Services 

Publications By Therapeutic Indication that have publicly acknowledged RBM success 

A Few Success Stories that have publicly acknowledged RBM success Schizophrenia Bone Metastasis Ocular Inflammation Kidney Disease Pulmonary Fibrosis Alzheimer’s Disease COPD Alcohol Abuse Myelofibrosis 

Expertise in Biomarker Research for Neuroscience that have publicly acknowledged RBM success 63 Publications 30 in Neurodegenerative Diseases (AD, PD, OD) 

Psychiatric  that have publicly acknowledged RBM successvs Neurodegenerative  Schizophrenia, BD, and MDD SZP: 18 years BD:  21 years MDD:  25 years AD, PD, and OD AD: >65 years BD:  60 years OD:  >65 years “The blood based biomarker patterns of disease in younger people are easier to see as there are fewer confounders such as underlying diseases like CVD and diabetes.  In addition, an average 65 year old in the US is on a regimen of at least five different drugs.” 

We understand much about the terminal pathology that have publicly acknowledged RBM success We understand very little about the etiology of AD 

What  that have publicly acknowledged RBM success are  the  project’s  goals? Early Dx for MCI/AD (blood test for >50 years) Identify rapid MCI to AD converters (20%) Differentiate AD from other forms of dementia Identify responders in drug trials 

Tony Wyss- that have publicly acknowledged RBM successCoray’s group at Stanford Med Ray Biotech 2-D slide-based array 100+ analytes First suggestion in literature that a signal for MCI/AD was present in the plasma proteome “We found 18 signaling proteins in blood plasma that can be used to classify blinded samples from Alzheimer's and control subjects with close to 90% accuracy and to identify patients who had mild cognitive impairment that progressed to Alzheimer's disease 2–6 years” 

Ray et al. Heat Map of the 18 markers that have publicly acknowledged RBM success 

EDTA Plasma from 19 AD/22 Controls that have publicly acknowledged RBM success HumanMAP v 1.6 (90 analytes) Attempt to reproduce the Ray, et al findings Mentions early Rotterdam data with their 1,200 member cohort and our later 152 analyte MAP. “Furthermore, utilization of other analytes from the 90-analyte panel did show a diagnostic accuracy of approximately 70%” 

“ that have publicly acknowledged RBM success “ 

CSF from 62 AD; 33 Controls and 25 OD that have publicly acknowledged RBM success Pre-DiscoveryMAP (152 analytes) MAP data added with tau, P-tau181 & Aβ42 >90% accuracy in AD/OD diagnosis 17 MAP analytes by Random Forest; 32 by PAM “Two categories of biomarkers were identified: (1) analytes that specifically distinguished AD (especially CSF Aβ42 levels) from cognitively normal subjects and other disorders; and (2) analytes altered in multiple diseases, but not in cognitively normal subjects ” 

Serum from 197 AD; 203 Controls (TARC Cohort) that have publicly acknowledged RBM success Pre-DiscoveryMAP (152 analytes) MAP data + clinical data+ ApoE4 genotype = >95% AUC AD vs. normals 30 MAP analytes by Random Forest; 25 by SAM (minimal overlap with Ray et al: Ang 2 and TNFα) “The identification of blood-based biomarker profiles with good diagnostic accuracy would have a profound impact worldwide and requires further validation.” O’Bryant et al. 2010 – Arch Neurol. 67(9): 1077-1081 

TARCC Analyses that have publicly acknowledged RBM success Restricted to only top 30 markers Added clinical lab values  Total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase [Lp-PLA2], homocysteine, C-peptide) Retained demographic factors O'Bryant et al 2011a 

TARCC Analyses that have publicly acknowledged RBM success O'Bryant et al 2011a 

TARCC Analyses that have publicly acknowledged RBM success O'Bryant et al 2011a 

TARCC Analyses that have publicly acknowledged RBM success Need to cross-validate screener in an independent cohort Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Large-scale study of AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Has same biomarker panel on subset of AD cases and controls O'Bryant et al 2011b 

TARCC Analyses that have publicly acknowledged RBM success Problem – ADNI has plasma based proteins while TARCC has serum There is no consensus as to what blood fraction to look at for AD biomarkers Many groups look at both serum and plasma, even using same markers Markers may or may not behave consistently across media  O'Bryant et al 2011b 

TARCC Analyses that have publicly acknowledged RBM success TARCC has plasma-based proteins on 40 AD cases Looked at serum and plasma results to identify Proteins that behave consistently across serum and plasma R2>0.75 Significant (p<0.05) relation to AD status Identified 11 proteins that met criteria CRP, adiponectin, pancreatic polypeptide, fatty acid binding protein, IL18, beta 2 microglobulin, tenascin C, I.309, factor VIII, VCAM1, MCP1 O'Bryant et al 2011b 

TARCC Analyses that have publicly acknowledged RBM success Created RF biomarker risk score based on the 11 proteins using the TARCC serum data Applied the algorithm (protein risk score, demographics, clinical labs) to the ADNI plasma data O'Bryant et al 2011b 

TARCC Analyses that have publicly acknowledged RBM success O'Bryant et al 2011b 

Serum vs. Plasma? that have publicly acknowledged RBM success Thoroughly compared serum and plasma from the same donor and bleed with HumanMAP v. 1.6 (90 analytes) 70 “useful” analytes in “healthy, normal” samples 29 analytes had a concordance >0.8 and 41 had a concordance of <0.8 between serum and plasma with 24<0.5 “Serum showed a slight advantage…..” MRBM recommends serum for any MCI/AD diagnostic “ Performance evaluation of a multiplex assay for future use in biomarker discovery  efforts to predict body composition Clin Chem Lab Med 2011 Beam J., Wright, N., Thompson, P., Hu, C., Guerra, S., and Chen, Z. ” 

ADNI Cohort of 566 individuals tested for 190 analytes that have publicly acknowledged RBM success Focused on 54 controls and 163 MCI to AD converters 11 analyte signature with APOE Meta-analysis produced an 8 feature signature with 86% SN and 87% SP By adding longitudinal data this was improved to over 90% for both SN and SP
