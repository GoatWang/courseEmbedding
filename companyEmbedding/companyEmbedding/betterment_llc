What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Frequently Asked Questions


Where are the fees taken from?
Fees are taken right from your Betterment account. No action is required on your part, and we'll never charge fees if you don't have a balance.


Is there a fee for a $0 balance?
No, you will never be charged for an account with a $0 balance.



Which accounts are included in determining my qualification for the Premium plan?
The minimum balance requirement for this plan is based on your combined balance across your IRA and taxable accounts, joint accounts, and trusts at Betterment. If you also have a 401(k) account through Betterment For Business, that account is subject to a separate fee schedule and is not included in the minimum balance requirement.


Which accounts are included in determining my qualification for the Plus or Premium plans?
The minimum balance requirement for those plans is based on your combined balance across your IRA and taxable accounts, joint accounts, and trusts at Betterment. If you also have a 401(k) account through Betterment For Business, that account is subject to a separate fee schedule and is not included in the minimum balance requirement.



Are there deposit, withdrawals, or ETF fees?
All portfolios are subject to fund level fees. Learn more about each fund fee here. Our annual fee covers everything else. You are not charged any trade or transaction fees.


Can I cancel at any time?
Yes, you can cancel at any time. Fees will be prorated, so if you leave before a month is over, you will only pay for the time you had a balance.


What if I have over $2 million in my account?
You will not be charged a fee on any additional investments above $2 million. The more you invest, the lower your effective fee rate.

Invest in thousands of companies.

            See a complete list of our stock ETFs and bond ETFs.
          


Stocks










U.S. Total Stock Market
U.S. Total Stock Market contains broad exposure to the historically strong long-term growth of the U.S. economy.


U.S. Large-Cap Value Stocks
U.S. large-cap Value stocks overlap with the U.S. Total Stock Market, but are included to tilt the portfolio toward large-size companies with low price-to-earnings ratios.


U.S. Mid-Cap Value Stocks
U.S. mid-cap Value stocks overlap with the U.S. Total Stock Market, but are included to tilt the portfolio toward medium-size companies with low price-to-earnings ratios.


U.S. Small-Cap Value Stocks
U.S. small-cap Value stocks overlap with the U.S. Total Stock Market, but are included to tilt the portfolio toward small-size companies with low price-to-earnings ratios.


International Developed Stocks
Developed Markets stocks provide exposure to a diverse set of companies from international developed economies including the UK, Europe, Japan, and others.


Emerging Market Stocks
Emerging Markets provide higher return potential and diversification, but they come with higher risk compared to U.S. or International Developed stocks.




Bonds










Short-Term Treasuries
This extremely low-risk asset class is a cash alternative that generates nominal benefit through interest payments, and de-risks the portfolio at safer allocations.


Inflation Protected Bonds
This allocation serves to insulate a part of the portfolio from the depreciating effects of inflation while also having historically low correlation with other asset classes.


U.S. High Quality or Municipal Bonds
For fixed income with slightly higher risk and returns than U.S. Treasuries, taxable accounts use Municipals and IRA and 401(k) accounts use U.S. High Quality bonds.


U.S. Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds generally offer attractive yields and opportunity for capital appreciation to compensate investors for default risk.


International Bonds
International Bonds have high credit quality and provide interest rate diversification for a bond portfolio, resulting in higher risk-adjusted returns.


Emerging Markets Bonds
Emerging Markets Bonds are dollar-denominated bonds issued by governments with economies that are rapidly growing and industrializing.





















Low Costs
Expense ratios well below the industry average.










Low Taxes
Funds that are typically the most tax-efficient.










Optimal Risk
Exposure across domestic and international markets.










Allocate assets for optimal performance.
How your money is spread across stocks and bonds can impact your long-term returns. We'll recommend how much risk to take on based on when you'll need your money.










Invest across the world.
Your Betterment portfolio can benefit from growth in both developed and emerging markets, so you're less exposed to the economy of any one country. Learn more.









Historically better results.
Betterment would have outperformed the average private client investor in almost all periods over the last decade. Learn more about how we determined this.






























Socially Responsible Investing
Socially responsible portfolio option available.
Now your investments can work as hard for your personal values as they do to maximize your money. Our Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) portfolio helps you invest in a low-cost, globally diversified portfolio that reduces your exposure to companies that don't meet certain social, environmental, and governance criteria.

Frequently Asked Questions


What is an ETF?
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a security that tracks an index, a commodity or a basket of assets just like an index fund, but trades like a stock on an exchange. Betterment uses ETFs in both our stock and bond portfolios because of the liquidity, diversification, and low management fees they offer. Read more.



Will my Betterment portfolio beat the market?
Betterment is a strong believer in passive investing. The majority of the evidence shows that active management, whether by individual investors or fund managers, can cause more harm than good in net-of-fee returns. We therefore invest in low-cost, passive investments which seek to match the market's performance. Read more.


Will a taxable portfolio be different from a non-taxable portfolio?
Yes—We distinguish between taxable and retirement accounts when allocating bonds for additional optimization. Taxable accounts generally hold federally tax-exempt municipal bonds, providing portfolios more favorable after-tax return. Tax advantaged retirement accounts generally maintain exposure to U.S. investment-grade bonds.


Will my Betterment portfolio be globally diversified?
Yes—By using the world's markets as its baseline, the Betterment portfolio diversifies risk on a number of levels including currency, interest rates, credit risk, monetary policy, and economic growth country by country. As economic circumstances may drag down one nation, global diversification helps decrease the risk that one geographic area alone will drag down your portfolio. Read more.


Can my Betterment portfolio decrease in value?
Yes—Far from unusual, downturns are a normal part of even the highest returning investments. Investors often worry and react with panic in response to market drops, even if they are invested properly for their long-term goals, but interim losses are to be expected even during the best investment periods. Read more.


Where can I learn more about the Betterment portfolio and investing strategy?
You can read more about the Betterment portfolio, investment strategy, ETFs, taxes and more at our Resource Center.

Personalized Financial Planning Advice | Betterment

























































Financial experts, at your fingertips.

Personalized guidance for you
Retiring, buying a home, having a child—these are exciting life moments that come with so many financial questions. Our tools and experts are here to help guide you along the way.







Investing for your goals



Get personalized advice based on your needs.


We start with your goal—the reason you're investing. Then, we make various recommendations: risk level, amount to invest, and type of account.


This type of personalized strategy is called "goal-based investing," and research shows it improves outcomes by encouraging optimal behavior and more precise wealth management.

















We're here for the moments you hope for—and for the ones you might not expect.










If you're planning for retirement...









We'll advise you on how much to save, what types of accounts to invest in, and an optimal risk level based on when you want to retire. 












If you're planning to buy a home...









We'll create a slightly more conservative portfolio, given that this is a short- to medium-term goal.












If you have a baby...









We're here to help you invest for your child's future.












If you switch jobs...









We're here to help you roll over old 401(k)s and IRAs to help you make the most of your money.












If you receive an inheritance...









Our experts can advise on how to invest it.












If the market goes down...









We're prepared, because our advice model factors in market downturns. We've also put guardrails in place to help prevent you from making decisions in the heat of the moment. 












If you're not sure what to save for...









We have a goal for that. Often you don't have a specific reason to save but still want to grow your wealth over time. Allowing for flexibility, we'll provide allocation guidance according to the number of years you want to stay invested. 















Your money in one place
Get advice on your outside investments.
You can sync your outside accounts, such as other investments and bank accounts, to see if you're losing money to high fees and uninvested cash.












Best of both worlds
Lean on licensed experts and round-the-clock technology.

Our technology helps you get better returns, and our CFP® professionals and licensed financial experts are here if you need them.

You come first
We have one mission: To empower you to make the most of your money, so you can live better.













The industry problem
The old way of managing money is broken.
When it comes to investing for the future, you've likely had a couple of options: You could do it yourself, or you could hand it off to an investment manager. The first can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone; the second has historically meant tolerating outdated technology and potential conflicts of interest.











Our story
You deserve a better way to invest.
Jon Stein created Betterment because he believed that people's money should work as hard for them as they worked to earn it. By combining proven investment strategies with technology that drives down costs, Jon believed that people would finally have a way to make the most of their money.















Our commitment
The new way of managing money puts you first.
We're a fiduciary, which means we act in your best interests. We're not incentivized to recommend certain funds, and we don't have our own investment products to sell. That means we'll do what we believe is right for you.

                Betterment, LLC            


    By Mark P. Cussen, CFP®, CMFC, AFC | January 18, 2017 — 7:00 AM EST    






Share


















































Name: Betterment, LLC
Estimated valuation: $700 million
Product: Automated investment service
IPO Timeline: TBD
Date founded: August 25, 2008
Betterment is an automated investment advisory service that provides portfolio management to investors through the use of computer algorithms and research. Its program can create a personalized investment plan for retail, IRA, Roth IRA and 401(k) rollover investors. Headquartered in New York City, Betterment also provides personalized financial advice at a comparatively low cost. The company's fees range from 0.15% to 0.35%, and its mobile app allows customers to view, track, access and share their account information as well as make deposits and withdrawals at any time from any place.
Betterment's Offerings
Betterment's trading platform incorporates the use of tax-loss harvesting in order to offset capital gains and other forms of investment income. It also offers an online service called RetireGuide, which is a series of surveys that can help users to determine their investment objectives and risk tolerance. The company boasts on its website that its global portfolios and rebalancing programs can deliver returns that are 4.30% higher than the typical do-it-yourself investor. Its portfolios are constructed using Nobel Prize-Winning research and are constructed from global stock and bond exchange-traded index funds. Their selection methodology is designed to maximize after-tax returns and minimize expenses through the use of low-cost ETFs. These funds are chosen based upon their total annual cost of ownership (TCO). This scoring method is used to calculate the total cost of owning an exchange-traded fund, including the cost of its transactions as well as liquidity costs and costs associated with holding funds.
Betterment was originally founded by Eli Broverman, Jon Stein and Jonathan Stein. It has received $205 million in funding from 14 investors, including Citi Ventures, Kinnevik AB and Bessemer Venture Partners. The most recent round of funding was for $100 million from Kennevik AB in March of 2016. On Oct. 18, 2013 the company acquired Impulsave, a banking platform that allows people to conduct their banking via mobile app.




Betterment has recently entered the business market with its Betterment for Business platform, which facilitates the management of 401(k) plans for businesses. The company announced in December 2016 that it currently has about 300 customers using this platform, and that its total assets under management (AUM) have surpassed the $6.2 billion mark, an increase of $1 billion over the previous eight months. The company is aggressively courting technology startup companies with this new platform and has partnered with Uber to provide their drivers with benefits in August of 2016. Betterment claims to charge lower fees than traditional 401(k) legacy plan providers, many of which are too expensive for smaller businesses. Given that 99% of all U.S. businesses are small or mid-sized, this represents a substantial market. Betterment's decision to target businesses will likely give it a greater edge when the traditional legacy plan providers introduce their own robo-advisory plans to the market, as this approach can enable the company to capture larger numbers of clients and a greater amount of assets.
An Exploding Market
Betterment also announced a partnership with the Financial Planning Association (FPA) in December 2016, which plans to integrate Betterment's resources into the association to support its network of CFP Practitioners. In a released statement, FPA Executive Director Lauren M. Schadle said, “Our members and all CFP professionals are increasingly interested in learning how digital investment advice can augment the robust financial planning services they are providing clients while staying true to the high-touch level of advice they are already providing. This partnership is a step in the right direction to educating and supporting the financial planning community.”
The future looks bright for the robo-advisor industry, which has the potential to substantially impact and disrupt the traditional money management industry in many ways. Business Insider recently released a report detailing the future of these automated programs, and some of the key takeaways conclude that startup companies like Betterment and Wealthfront will not upend traditional money managers, which are rapidly rolling out their own robo-platforms and scaling their businesses accordingly. Consumers of all types seem to be receptive to using these programs for at least a portion of their money, including the wealthy, almost half of whom said that they would consider investing at least a portion of their assets in a robo-advisor.
Betterment currently has no plans for an initial public offering (IPO) and is choosing instead to focus on growing its customer base. But robo-advisors will continue to increase their market share in an increasingly competitive environment. In April 2017, Betterment's co-founder and president Eli Broverman announced he would be moving on from the business. Co-founder and CEO Jon Stein will remain in charge.

History[edit]
Foundation and launch[edit]
Betterment was founded in 2008 in New York City by Jon Stein, a Columbia Business School MBA graduate, and Eli Broverman, a lawyer out of NYU School of Law. Stein and his roommate Sean Owen, a Google software engineer, started building the first online platform for Betterment in 2008 using a Java application and MySQL database on Apache Tomcat servers with an Adobe Flash- and Flex-based front-end design. Initial prototype designs were provided by Stein's then-girlfriend, Polina Khentov. Facing regulation associated with starting a financial company, Stein began negotiations to bring on Eli Broverman, then a securities lawyer he met over regular poker games, as a co-founder in 2008.[6]
Broverman and Stein were prepared to offer financial advice online as an SEC-registered investment advisor, and also decided to offer broker-dealer services for advice to customers. Betterment added Ryan O'Sullivan, a "serial entrepreneur",[6] to establish Betterment's broker-dealer operation.
From 2008 to 2010, the founding team continued to develop the platform for launch. Betterment gained approval from FINRA for membership. In 2009, Anthony Schrauth, a former colleague of Stein's joined Betterment as chief product officer, and Owen was replaced by Kiran Keshav of Columbia University's Center for Computational Biology. O'Sullivan left his role as president in 2010.[6]
Betterment, LLC was established as a Delaware corporation on April 7, 2009. The parent company for Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities, Betterment Holdings, Inc. was established in Delaware on January 29, 2008.[7]
The company launched at TechCrunch Disrupt New York in June 2010, and won the award of "Biggest New York Disruptor."[6][8][9] Within 24 hours, Betterment had attracted nearly 400 early customers, and the company began talks with early investors.[10][6]
Betterment received Series A round funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December 2010. By October 2012, Menlo Ventures provided Series B funding along with Bessemer Venture Partners and Anthemis Group.[10][11] By 2012, the company established product offerings, such IRAs, auto-deposit, auto-rebalancing, and goal-based investing advice.[11]
Trading suspension post-Brexit[edit]
On June 24, 2016, Betterment suspended trading for 2.5 hours, after the unexpected vote in favor of Brexit sent shockwaves of volatility through the financial markets. Subsequently, the firm was accused of not properly communicating the halt in trading with its customers. Following this incident, Betterment faced significant backlash against the protective move on social media, and Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin raised concerns over Betterment's actions, remarking that some customers could have been at a disadvantage because of the trading halt.[12][13][14]
The unexpected trading suspension also caused concern among financial advisers using Betterment through the Betterment For Advisors platform. Advisers including Eric Roberge grew concerned over the trading suspension as it prevented him from updating client portfolios: “I don’t feel comfortable with someone else telling me what I can and cannot do” on clients’ behalf, Roberge said.[12][13] Other advisers expressed concerns about Betterment's decision regarding communication and questioned why the decision was not communicated to the customers and financial advisors, causing lingering questions around Betterment's policies.[15]
Pricing changes[edit]
On January 31, 2017, Betterment updated their pricing for deposits, which effectively raised prices for customers with deposits of $100,000 or higher from 0.15% to 0.25%. The shift in pricing structure aggravated some existing users, causing additional media attention.[16]
Current operations[edit]
Betterment's current business model includes three areas of business: retail investment, a platform for advisors, and a 401(k) for mid-market business. In April 2017, Betterment announced its assets under management (AUM) had surpassed $8.5 billion.[17]
Retail account types include individual investment accounts, Joint investment account, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), SEP-IRAs, Rollover accounts, Trusts, and accounts with automated asset location optimization.
In October 2014, Betterment launched a business-to-business offering called Betterment Institutional, subsequently renamed Betterment for Advisors, a digital platform for managing client assets using Betterment's built-in financial advice. In January 2017, the Financial Planning Association (FPA) and Betterment for Advisors ran a program on digital investment advice for the association's members.[18]
Betterment for Business is a turnkey 401(k) platform aimed at mid-market employers. It uses the same underlying investment strategy and generally costs less than most traditional 401(k) plans.[19]
Research[edit]
In 2013, Betterment’s data analysis team released an open source software research project written in Python and Pandas analyzing mutual fund data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Led by Alex Benke, CFP, the team co-authored a whitepaper with financial planner Richard A. Ferri, CFA, Founder of Portfolio Solutions.[20] The report identified four key findings which support investing using an all-index fund portfolio:

Advanced portfolios holding ten asset classes showed index fund outperforming comparable actively managed portfolios 90% of the time.
Diversification of active managers within asset classes (holding two or more funds of the same asset class) reduced active portfolio performance dramatically, with the passive strategy outperforming multiple active funds 90% of the time.
Increased holding period steadily increased the chance of index fund portfolio outperformance.
Low-fee actively managed fund portfolios did not meaningfully increase the chance of success.

History[edit]
Foundation and launch[edit]
Betterment was founded in 2008 in New York City by Jon Stein, a Columbia Business School MBA graduate, and Eli Broverman, a lawyer out of NYU School of Law. Stein and his roommate Sean Owen, a Google software engineer, started building the first online platform for Betterment in 2008 using a Java application and MySQL database on Apache Tomcat servers with an Adobe Flash- and Flex-based front-end design. Initial prototype designs were provided by Stein's then-girlfriend, Polina Khentov. Facing regulation associated with starting a financial company, Stein began negotiations to bring on Eli Broverman, then a securities lawyer he met over regular poker games, as a co-founder in 2008.[6]
Broverman and Stein were prepared to offer financial advice online as an SEC-registered investment advisor, and also decided to offer broker-dealer services for advice to customers. Betterment added Ryan O'Sullivan, a "serial entrepreneur",[6] to establish Betterment's broker-dealer operation.
From 2008 to 2010, the founding team continued to develop the platform for launch. Betterment gained approval from FINRA for membership. In 2009, Anthony Schrauth, a former colleague of Stein's joined Betterment as chief product officer, and Owen was replaced by Kiran Keshav of Columbia University's Center for Computational Biology. O'Sullivan left his role as president in 2010.[6]
Betterment, LLC was established as a Delaware corporation on April 7, 2009. The parent company for Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities, Betterment Holdings, Inc. was established in Delaware on January 29, 2008.[7]
The company launched at TechCrunch Disrupt New York in June 2010, and won the award of "Biggest New York Disruptor."[6][8][9] Within 24 hours, Betterment had attracted nearly 400 early customers, and the company began talks with early investors.[10][6]
Betterment received Series A round funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December 2010. By October 2012, Menlo Ventures provided Series B funding along with Bessemer Venture Partners and Anthemis Group.[10][11] By 2012, the company established product offerings, such IRAs, auto-deposit, auto-rebalancing, and goal-based investing advice.[11]
Trading suspension post-Brexit[edit]
On June 24, 2016, Betterment suspended trading for 2.5 hours, after the unexpected vote in favor of Brexit sent shockwaves of volatility through the financial markets. Subsequently, the firm was accused of not properly communicating the halt in trading with its customers. Following this incident, Betterment faced significant backlash against the protective move on social media, and Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin raised concerns over Betterment's actions, remarking that some customers could have been at a disadvantage because of the trading halt.[12][13][14]
The unexpected trading suspension also caused concern among financial advisers using Betterment through the Betterment For Advisors platform. Advisers including Eric Roberge grew concerned over the trading suspension as it prevented him from updating client portfolios: “I don’t feel comfortable with someone else telling me what I can and cannot do” on clients’ behalf, Roberge said.[12][13] Other advisers expressed concerns about Betterment's decision regarding communication and questioned why the decision was not communicated to the customers and financial advisors, causing lingering questions around Betterment's policies.[15]

Betterment is an online investment company based in New York City, registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Also known as Betterment.com, Betterment is a registered investment advisor (RIA)—the largest online investment advisor in the U.S.—and a broker-dealer.[1] With both functions, The company provides personalized financial advice and automated investment management, investment execution, tax optimization, custodianship, and record-keeping. Betterment has a subsidiary 401(k) plan business Betterment for Business, and Betterment for Advisors, a management platform for registered investment advisors.
The company is an automated, goal-based investing service. Betterment invests in a portfolio of passive index-tracking equity and fixed income exchange-traded funds (ETFs)[2] and offers both taxable and tax-advantaged investment accounts, including traditional and Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs). The company's personalized financial advice uses principles-based robo-advisor technologies such as computer algorithms. Licensed financial advisors provide over-the-phone consultations to customers who opt for additional support.[3] Betterment's primary retail platform offers individual retirement accounts, trusts, taxable investment accounts, and tax-coordinated asset location services.
In 2013 Christopher Mims of Quartz called Betterment the "Apple of finance."[4] Considered a growth-stage startup, the company is headquartered in New York City, and has received funding from Menlo Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Globespan Capital Partners, Citi Ventures, Francisco Partners, Kinnevik AB, and Anthemis Group.[5]

History[edit]
Foundation and launch[edit]
Betterment was founded in 2008 in New York City by Jon Stein, a Columbia Business School MBA graduate, and Eli Broverman, a lawyer out of NYU School of Law. Stein and his roommate Sean Owen, a Google software engineer, started building the first online platform for Betterment in 2008 using a Java application and MySQL database on Apache Tomcat servers with an Adobe Flash- and Flex-based front-end design. Initial prototype designs were provided by Stein's then-girlfriend, Polina Khentov. Facing regulation associated with starting a financial company, Stein began negotiations to bring on Eli Broverman, then a securities lawyer he met over regular poker games, as a co-founder in 2008.[6]
Broverman and Stein were prepared to offer financial advice online as an SEC-registered investment advisor, and also decided to offer broker-dealer services for advice to customers. Betterment added Ryan O'Sullivan, a "serial entrepreneur",[6] to establish Betterment's broker-dealer operation.
From 2008 to 2010, the founding team continued to develop the platform for launch. Betterment gained approval from FINRA for membership. In 2009, Anthony Schrauth, a former colleague of Stein's joined Betterment as chief product officer, and Owen was replaced by Kiran Keshav of Columbia University's Center for Computational Biology. O'Sullivan left his role as president in 2010.[6]
Betterment, LLC was established as a Delaware corporation on April 7, 2009. The parent company for Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities, Betterment Holdings, Inc. was established in Delaware on January 29, 2008.[7]
The company launched at TechCrunch Disrupt New York in June 2010, and won the award of "Biggest New York Disruptor."[6][8][9] Within 24 hours, Betterment had attracted nearly 400 early customers, and the company began talks with early investors.[10][6]
Betterment received Series A round funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December 2010. By October 2012, Menlo Ventures provided Series B funding along with Bessemer Venture Partners and Anthemis Group.[10][11] By 2012, the company established product offerings, such IRAs, auto-deposit, auto-rebalancing, and goal-based investing advice.[11]
Trading suspension post-Brexit[edit]
On June 24, 2016, Betterment suspended trading for 2.5 hours, after the unexpected vote in favor of Brexit sent shockwaves of volatility through the financial markets. Subsequently, the firm was accused of not properly communicating the halt in trading with its customers. Following this incident, Betterment faced significant backlash against the protective move on social media, and Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin raised concerns over Betterment's actions, remarking that some customers could have been at a disadvantage because of the trading halt.[12][13][14]
The unexpected trading suspension also caused concern among financial advisers using Betterment through the Betterment For Advisors platform. Advisers including Eric Roberge grew concerned over the trading suspension as it prevented him from updating client portfolios: “I don’t feel comfortable with someone else telling me what I can and cannot do” on clients’ behalf, Roberge said.[12][13] Other advisers expressed concerns about Betterment's decision regarding communication and questioned why the decision was not communicated to the customers and financial advisors, causing lingering questions around Betterment's policies.[15]
Pricing changes[edit]
On January 31, 2017, Betterment updated their pricing for deposits, which effectively raised prices for customers with deposits of $100,000 or higher from 0.15% to 0.25%. The shift in pricing structure aggravated some existing users, causing additional media attention.[16]
Current operations[edit]
Betterment's current business model includes three areas of business: retail investment, a platform for advisors, and a 401(k) for mid-market business. In April 2017, Betterment announced its assets under management (AUM) had surpassed $8.5 billion.[17]
Retail account types include individual investment accounts, Joint investment account, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), SEP-IRAs, Rollover accounts, Trusts, and accounts with automated asset location optimization.
In October 2014, Betterment launched a business-to-business offering called Betterment Institutional, subsequently renamed Betterment for Advisors, a digital platform for managing client assets using Betterment's built-in financial advice. In January 2017, the Financial Planning Association (FPA) and Betterment for Advisors ran a program on digital investment advice for the association's members.[18]
Betterment for Business is a turnkey 401(k) platform aimed at mid-market employers. It uses the same underlying investment strategy and generally costs less than most traditional 401(k) plans.[19]
Research[edit]
In 2013, Betterment’s data analysis team released an open source software research project written in Python and Pandas analyzing mutual fund data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Led by Alex Benke, CFP, the team co-authored a whitepaper with financial planner Richard A. Ferri, CFA, Founder of Portfolio Solutions.[20] The report identified four key findings which support investing using an all-index fund portfolio:

Advanced portfolios holding ten asset classes showed index fund outperforming comparable actively managed portfolios 90% of the time.
Diversification of active managers within asset classes (holding two or more funds of the same asset class) reduced active portfolio performance dramatically, with the passive strategy outperforming multiple active funds 90% of the time.
Increased holding period steadily increased the chance of index fund portfolio outperformance.
Low-fee actively managed fund portfolios did not meaningfully increase the chance of success.

            Learn about ConsumerAffairs for Brands!Consumer Complaints and ReviewsEwen of San Francisco, CA on July 17, 2017Satisfaction RatingI opened a Roth IRA with Betterment to try out the product. It was fairly seamless to sign up and deposit my 2017 year contribution. Then I ended up deciding to go with Schwab instead (more investment options and lower fees). The problem became getting the money OUT of Betterment. Betterment only offers PAPER transfers--that's right, you need to print out a sheet of paper, fill it out, and mail it to Betterment. They also don't accept amendments, so if anything is incorrect or not perfectly legible (as is often the case when dealing with multiple account numbers written out by hand) you need to redo the entire process.For me, I had a typo on my form. The transfer had the wrong account number, even though it was an obvious mistake. They are now requiring me to fill out the entire form again. This is very uncommon with financial institutions, especially one that sells itself as the "tech forward" solution. It will now be over 2 months and multiple hours from starting this process until I am able to complete this transfer. They are entirely unapologetic and have said they aren't looking into making transfers more flexible.Helpful?YesNoKailash of Boyds, MD on Nov. 16, 2016Satisfaction RatingI opened a retirement and a wealth builder account with Betterment on September 15 when DIJ was at 18,034 and SP at 2,125 and I closed both the accounts on November 16 when DIJ is at 18, 850 and SP at 2175. Both indices went up 2-4% during the time frame but my deposits lost more than 1.5%. Looking at what the Betterment claims as the robo-investing in a diversified portfolio. Can anyone explain as to how the value of a diversified portfolio is going down when the market has gone significantly up! How can one expect it to do it better in the long-term. On the contrary, Charles Schwab's Intelligent Portfolio seem to reflect the market. I would advise investors to keep a close watch on their portfolio.Helpful?YesNojack of Plano, TX on Oct. 31, 2016Satisfaction RatingBetterment seems to perform two functions, they are a phishing site to collect personal information which they refuse to delete and a front for Vanguard funds. It is amazing that the best investments emanate from Vanguard and Schwab. The investments they propose would indicate they get a commission from the seller and a fee from their client. My opinion - a bunch of lowlifes.Helpful?YesNoPaul of Sioux Falls, SD on Aug. 25, 2016Satisfaction RatingAgents were very thorough and efficiently walked me through the process. I was very pleased with the results and have lower payments now. There's a broad level of customization options available to create a portfolio that works and fits with just about every income. I was pleased with this product. There were no additional fees that I recall, unless they were hidden within the monthly installment. Overall, the cost was a bit high, but fair, considering what you get out of it. It took some time to get used to the interface, but once I was acclimated to it, I was working it like a professional. It's very nice to have a product you can use yourself, rather than paying an individual to do it for you.Helpful?YesNoMelissa of Cochranton, PA on Aug. 22, 2016Satisfaction RatingThey care and give great quality customer service. It was easy and very helpful. I had no problems and it gave me great pleasure and they put me at ease for my request. The customization options were great and easy to choose from. Had a great variety of options. I will use them again in the future and will continue. The fees were not that much and it was convenient and very easy to understand. There were no problems and there wasn't any hesitation into my decisions. I was at great ease using this because I felt confident in my decisions and knew I would not change my mind and will come back again.Helpful?YesNo

Any time I called having a question with anything, the workers were always very friendly and helpful with answering my questions. The customization options are great. I like that they offer many and that I was able to choose which one was the closest to matching me and what I could afford at the time. I don't really like the additional fees. I have been fined a few times for things and I just think the fees are expensive and I do not agree with them. I would say the ease of use is great. I have not had any major issues with visiting the website or speaking to someone by phone. Overall I am very pleased.Helpful?YesNoVeronica of Chicago, IL on Aug. 3, 2016Satisfaction RatingI didn't use customer service much but it is very much evident that they are extremely customer focused by being completely user friendly and easy to contact. The customization options are great. They seemed to have thought of everything when it comes to what a custom experience should be like. I was able to move things around to fit my personal needs. I am not a fan of additional fees but the additional fees that are offered are satisfactory and make sense. In a perfect world everything would be free but that isn't so logical. The ease of use is very good. Navigating the services it offers and other areas within are very much self explanatory, which I admire since I favor being able to figure things out on my own.Helpful?YesNoMonisha of Jersey City, NJ on March 3, 2016Satisfaction RatingI lost 20% of my money. Their strategies are all wrong. It's not worth it even for the reduced fees. You may save a few hundreds in fees but lose a lot in principal. Don't invest. They have no FDIC insurance and regulation. It's a Ponzi scheme. You can lose all your money. It's better with a bank wealth management, they are regulated and insured.Helpful?YesNoRick of Dysart, IA on Oct. 18, 2015Satisfaction RatingI have been putting some money into this company. It seems like every month I see a loss. I understand the market stinks but is anyone managing this? I would make more money in a traditional savings account. Good thing I only have been putting in trial money.Helpful?YesNoExpert ReviewBarbara FriedbergPersonal Finance Contributing EditorBarbara Friedberg, MBA, MS is a former investment portfolio manager with decades of financial experience. Friedberg taught Finance and Investments at several universities. Her work has been featured in U.S. News & World Report, Investopedia, Yahoo!Finance and many more publications.

        	Top
        	PricingDifferent services have different pricing models. Consumers should choose a service with a pricing model that makes sense for their budget, whether it is an annual fee, commission-based or percent of AUM.Assets under management (AUM) fees: Many firms charge consumers a percentage amount of the value of their entire investment portfolio. The fees range from zero to 0.89 percent. Some firms offer free trial periods as well as the first $10,000 managed for free.
                                    Commission trading fees: Some automated advisors charge a commission fee when investments are bought and sold. The amount is approximately $10 per trade. Other firms wave the commissions.
                                    Underlying mutual or exchange traded management fee: Every mutual and exchange traded fund levies a management fee. In general, most robo-advisors choose low-fee exchange traded funds with fees below 0.2 percent of the amount invested. This fee goes to the firm that creates the fund, not to the automated investment advisor.
                                    Rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting fees: Some automated advisors charge extra for rebalancing the investor’s funds back to their originally selected proportions. Additionally, there may be charges for the selling and buying activities performed to minimize the investor’s taxes.
                                    ExperienceIt is best to work with an automated investment service that has a solid track record and an established history. Consider the background and expertise of each firm as well as the credentials of their investment advisory teams.Previous clients: Consumers should examine reviews and testimonials. Reputable services should be happy to offer client reviews and case studies in order to give consumers a sense of their success rates. It’s important to take testimonials with a grain of salt and investigate the source of the review.
                                    Industry expertise: Different services have experts with experience in specific industries. Consumers should find out if a particular service has worked with many other people in the same industry.
                                    Investor’s background: Specific automated investment services are targeted towards certain types of consumers. A provider that requires a high minimum investment amount may be preferable for older investors with greater wealth. Other services target millennials and those just starting out. Consumers should seek a service that fits with their personal profile.
                                    AccessibilityA service isn’t much help if it’s difficult to use. Consumers should investigate the method of customer service contact and overall website accessibility.Customer support: Services with a dedicated team of customer support specialists are helpful in navigating the various components of a service. If consumers run into issues while using a platform, it’s important to be confident that the problems will be addressed quickly and efficiently. Consumers should investigate whether there is live customer support in addition to email contact.
                                    Interface: The computer interface should be easy to navigate and understand. It is becoming increasingly important to have a sophisticated interface. Check to see if the service offers the option of a free trial period in order to get acquainted with the interface and the product.
                                    Dashboard: Several advisors have robust consumer dashboards for their clients. Other firms offer a free investment overview dashboard for all consumers. It is helpful to find out what metrics the platform tracks as well as the available types of investment reports.
                                    Maintenance: Ideally, a service will not require much maintenance. Most of the work should be automated so consumers can rest assured that their money is being handled efficiently.
                                    Tax efficiencyThe best services help consumers not only invest money, but also to do so in a tax-efficient fashion.Tax-loss harvesting: Tax-loss harvesting systems find embedded capital losses that lower investment taxes and increase after-tax returns.
                                    Tax-aware allocation: Tax-aware allocation systems ensure that money is apportioned to specific types of accounts in the most tax-efficient way.
                                    Included or add-on service: Not all automated investment advisors offer tax-loss harvesting and tax-aware allocation. Consumers should find out if these services are included and whether there are additional fees.
                                    Investment rates of returnThe main reason consumers invest is to optimize their investment returns.Low fees: Automated advisors with the lowest fees may start off with a head start as more of the customer’s money is going directly into the markets, not towards management fees.
                                    Return history: One indicator of future investment performance is a firm’s past history with other clients, although returns vary depending on the consumer’s asset allocation. It would be expected that over the long term investors with greater percentages of stock investments will outperform those with greater allocations to bond and fixed funds, albeit with greater investment volatility or risk.
                                    Types of funds: Most of the automated advisors offer exchanged traded funds. But their asset class choices will vary. The investment fund options may influence the individual investors long term returns.
                                    Investment return guarantees: Unlike investing in bank certificates of deposit, investing in the financial markets may yield volatile returns. This is a function of the financial markets, not the individual automated investment companies. There are no investment return guarantees when investing in stock, bond and other financial assets.
                                    Customization﻿In general, automated investment services have pre-determined investment portfolio. After taking a risk quiz, the platform will recommend a specific combination or asset allocation of funds. Many companies allow customers to adjust the pre-assigned asset allocation.Goal based framework: Quite a few services have a goal-based investing framework to help consumers set and reach their own unique investment goals.
                                    Algorithms: Sophisticated algorithms can help predict the best investment choices for specific risk profiles. When necessary, these platforms also automate the portfolio rebalancing.
                                    Diversified portfolios: All the robo-advisors offer diversified investment portfolios. The specifics of individual funds and securities varies by firm.
                                    What are different types of automated investment services?
        	Top
        	Investment holding servicesMost automated investment advisors take control of the consumers’ assets. They invest the money in funds and on occasion individual securities. The platform makes all trades, rebalances and adjusts according to the pre-determined plan parameters.Investment management servicesSeveral automated advisors manage the consumers’ accounts but don’t require the transfer to their own platform. In these circumstances, the robo-advisor may require that the investor use certain pre-determined investment companies. The investment services may be comparable to those at firms who take control of the investors assets.Advisor accessSome of the automated investment advisors include access to human financial advisors as well. Others rely on customer services specialists and email contact in their platform.Goal-based investment servicesThe specific approach of the automated financial advisors varies. Several start with a goal-based approach to investment management. These services cater toward investors looking to set future goals, such as retirement, vacation planning or other specific savings objectives, and then work backwards to develop a financial plan to meet the aspirations.Asset-allocation and other servicesMost if not all automated advisors incorporate asset-allocation services. Certain advisors may charge an extra fee for this service. Asset allocation explains the buying and selling of specific funds to return the investment portfolio mix back to its original percentages in each asset class. Additionally, some advisors offer tax-loss harvesting and additional investment management services.Who's it for?
        	Top
        	Small portfolio investorsLow minimum and low fee automated investment advisors are ideal for consumers just starting out. These consumers have a small amount of money available to invest. The automated advisors can help these consumers begin investing with their sound strategies, clear cut onboarding process and educational offerings.Low-risk InvestorsDue to the risk quizzes offered by the automated investment platforms, conservative investors can benefit from a well-diversified investment portfolio created in line with their risk comfort level. Additionally, most plans allow customization for investors seeking low-risk investing.High-risk InvestorsAggressive investors can structure their automated portfolio for the possibility of higher returns in exchange for assuming greater risk. There is even a robo-advisor that offers a Momentum based investment portfolio.All net worth investorsSeveral automated advisors cater toward wealthier investors while others are designed to attract the younger, less-affluent set. Within the automated investment advisor sphere there are a variety of platforms for all financial levels.What does the expert have to say?

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
