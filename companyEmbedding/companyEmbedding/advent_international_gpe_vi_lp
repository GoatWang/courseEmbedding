Advent International GPE VIII closes at $13 bln


March 22, 2016
By Luisa Beltran
 Follow @LuisaRBeltran





Advent International said Tuesday that its eighth flagship fund closed at $13 billion, above its $12 billion target. Advent International GPE VIII LP will invest in buyouts, recapitalizations and growth equity transactions, primarily in Europe and North America and selectively in other regions such as Asia and Latin America. Advent’s prior fund closed on $10.8 billion in 2012.
PRESS RELEASE
BOSTON and LONDON, March 22, 2016 – Advent International, one of the largest and
most experienced global private equity investors, today announced that it has completed
fundraising for Advent International GPE VIII Limited Partnership (“GPE VIII” or the “Fund”),
reaching its hard cap of $13 billion (€12 billion) after six months in the market. Advent’s
previous global fund, GPE VII, closed on $10.8 billion (€8.5 billion) in 2012.
 
GPE (Global Private Equity) VIII will pursue the same strategy as its predecessor funds,
investing in buyouts, recapitalizations and growth equity transactions, primarily in Europe
and North America and selectively in other regions such as Asia and Latin America. The
Fund will focus on five industry sectors in which Advent has significant experience and
knowledge: (1) business and financial services; (2) healthcare; (3) industrial; (4) retail,
consumer and leisure; and (5) technology, media and telecom.
 
Across its target sectors and regions, Advent will seek to invest in well-positioned companies 





with the potential for further operational improvement and partner with management teams
to create value through revenue and earnings growth.
 
“We are pleased with the strong support we received from both existing and new investors,” said
David Mussafer, a Managing Partner at Advent International in Boston. Mr. Mussafer is one of 14
Managing Partners at Advent. “We believe that our success is a result of our long-established
sector focus, global footprint and network, private partnership model, and the significant
operational resources and expertise we apply to our investments. This solid foundation positions
us well to continue to find and build successful businesses around the world.”
 
GPE VIII will be invested by a team of more than 130 investment professionals across
Europe, North America and Asia. These individuals can leverage the expertise and networks
of additional professionals from Advent’s Latin American Private Equity Fund (LAPEF)
program, which focuses on investments throughout Latin America.
 
“Our global team is one of the largest and most experienced in the private equity industry,”
said Ralf Huep, a Managing Partner at Advent International in Frankfurt. “This platform
allows us to generate a broad set of opportunities, invest selectively in the most compelling
businesses and drive operational improvement and growth to create value.”
 
“GPE VIII received commitments from a diverse base of institutional investors across the 





globe,” said Johanna Barr, a Managing Director and Global Co-Head of Limited Partner
Services at Advent International in London. “Approximately 90% of the committed capital
came from limited partners in Advent’s prior funds, with the remaining commitments provided
by a select number of new investors.”
 
“We are fortunate to have a large, loyal group of investors and greatly appreciate their
support in making this a successful fundraising,” said Robert Weaver, a Managing Director
and Global Co-Head of Limited Partner Services at Advent International in New York. “We
will work to earn their continued commitment by maintaining our focus on value creation.”
 
STRONG 25-YEAR TRACK RECORD
 
Advent’s GPE program has established a strong track record of investments and exits over
seven generations of funds and several economic and private equity cycles. Since 1990, the
program has invested in 228 private equity transactions in 29 countries and fully or
substantially realized 190 of those investments.
 
Recent investments by the GPE program include Ammeraal Beltech, Corialis, Hypo Group
Alpe Adria and Istituto Centrale delle Banche Popolari Italiane (ICBPI) in Europe; Distribution
International, Genoa and Noosa in North America; and Crompton Greaves Consumer
Electricals, The Learning Lab and QuEST Global Services in Asia.
 
Recent IPOs and sales of companies in the GPE program include Casa Reha, Douglas, 





Equiniti, GFKL Financial Services, Priory Group and Worldpay in Europe; Bojangles’, Party
City and TransUnion in North America; and CARE Hospitals in Asia.
 
KEY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
 
Over its long history of international investing, Advent has developed a number of core
capabilities which it believes provide significant competitive advantages throughout the
investment life cycle:
 

Long-established sector focus – Advent has been investing in each of its five target

sectors for 25 years and has made an average of over 60 investments per sector
worldwide. This expertise enables the firm to identify attractive investment opportunities in
higher-growth sub-sectors, develop and implement effective value creation plans and
position companies favorably for exit.

Global footprint and network – With over 170 investment professionals in 10 countries

on four continents, Advent brings to its investments both a broad global perspective and
deep knowledge of local markets. This platform allows the firm to help businesses grow
through international expansion, cross-border acquisitions and other initiatives.

Private partnership model – Advent remains a traditional private partnership owned and

operated by 45 partners and governed by a group of 14 Managing Partners. The firm
believes its ownership structure and economic incentives ensure that it is closely aligned 





with the interests of its investors.

Significant operational resources and expertise – To complement its deal team’s

capabilities, Advent draws on additional operational and sub-sector expertise, including an
in-house Portfolio Support Group and over 70 highly experienced external Operating
Partners. These Operating Partners, typically former CEOs, work alongside Advent’s
sector teams and management to support the development of companies through their
industry knowledge, operational know-how, leadership experience and contact networks.
 
In addition to the GPE program, Advent is currently investing its sixth Latin American private
equity fund, LAPEF VI. Capitalized at $2.1 billion, the 2015-vintage fund focuses on buyouts
and growth equity investments in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Chile and other countries
in the region.
 
This press release is not an offer or solicitation of an offer, or an invitation or inducement, to
invest in any Advent International fund. No person may invest in any Advent International
fund except in accordance with and subject to the terms of the applicable fund
documentation and applicable law.

integrated team of over 170 investment professionals across North America, Europe, Latin

Advent, GS Capital to make 3.7x their money with TransUnion IPO


June 26, 2015
By Luisa Beltran
 Follow @LuisaRBeltran




 


Advent International and GS Capital Partners needed a little more than three years to nearly quadruple their investment in credit reporting agency TransUnion.
Chicago-based TransUnion went public Thursday. Shares of the company surged nearly 13 percent, or $2.90, to close at $25.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The strong first day came after TransUnion raised roughly $665 million on Wednesday when it priced 29.55 million shares at $22.50, near the top of its $21 to $23 price range. Book runners on the deal included Goldman Sachs & Co, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank Securities. The underwriters have the option to buy another 4.4 million shares via the over allotment option, or greenshoe.
Advent’s and GS Capital’s investment in TransUnion dates back to April 2012 when the private equity firms’ closed their $3 billion purchase of the company. The seller was Madison Dearborn Partners. (MDP had planned to take TransUnion public, but decided to sell to Advent and GS Capital, making 2.25x its money.) 





With its sale to Advent/GS Capital, TransUnion saw its debt balloon to about $3 billion as of March 31, up from $1.6 billion in December 2011, according to SEC filings. The company’s revenue nearly doubled to $1.3 billion in 2014 from $767 million in 2012.
GS Capital, the private equity unit of Goldman Sachs, and Advent invested a combined $1.1 billion of equity as part of the acquisition, SEC filings indicate. Prior to the IPO, each sponsor owned 48.8 percent of the company. Neither firm sold shares in the IPO, but each firm’s stake was expected to fall after the offering to 39.7 percent, assuming the underwriters exercised the greenshoe.
GS Capital’s investment came from its last flagship fund, the vintage 2007 GS Capital Partners VI LP, which raised $20.3 billion. GS Capital VI is producing a 7.4 percent average IRR and 1.45x average multiple as of Dec. 31, data provider Bison said.
Advent used its sixth international PE fund to invest in TransUnion. Advent International GPE VI LP closed at $10.4 billion in 2008. The pool is producing a 19.3 percent net IRR and 1.8x investment multiple as of Sept. 30, according to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System. 





In late 2012, each PE firm got about $200 million back from TransUnion when it issued $400 million in PIK toggle notes to pay a dividend to its shareholders.
Each sponsor owns 72.35 million shares of the company. At Thursday’s closing price of $25.40 per share, each firm’s stake is worth $1.84 billion, or $3.67 billion combined. Including the $200 million dividend each already collected, each sponsor stands to make 3.7x its money.
Advent declined comment. TransUnion and Goldman Sachs could not be reached for comment.

Advent was founded in Boston, Massachusetts as a spin-out from TA Associates by Peter Brooke. Brooke had founded TA Associates in 1968 after having expanded the venture capital operations of TA's parent Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day. In 1985, Advent raised its first fund – a $14 million corporate venture capital program for Nabisco. In 1987, the firm raised the $225 million International Network Fund, its first institutional private equity fund. The firm raised its first European fund in 1989, when the $231 million European Special Situations Fund and opened its London office.

Through the 2000s, Advent's expansion accelerated as the firm raised additional funds for its various fund families and opening new offices in Europe and Asia.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
