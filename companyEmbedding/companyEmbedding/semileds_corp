UV Curing




UV curing refers to a special way in which coatings, inks and adhesives are cured or dried using “energy” from UV light sources, rather than conventional heat. In effect, the ultraviolet light spectrum in a UV lamp interacts with specially formulated chemistries to cure materials--typically more quickly, using less energy and thereby at lower cost than by other methods.  
The advantages of UV have been well-documented, particularly when used with manufactured products that include inks, adhesives and coatings on substrates that are sensitive to heat. In addition, UV is considered environmentally friendly since most of the solvents in inks, paints, adhesives and coatings can be eliminated, thanks to the special capabilities of UV curing.  
The UV LED technology is further revolutionizing the UV curing space. Since traditional UV light sources such as tubes and arc lamps contain Mercury, a notorious pollutant, the availability of mercury free UV LEDs is bringing further environmental soundness to the UV curing industry. 
SemiLEDs provides a wide range UV LEDs in the UVA range (360nm - 420nm). Please visit our  Products page to learn more 
about our UV products.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or this Quarterly Report, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding the future results of operations of SemiLEDs Corporation, or "we," "our" or the "Company," and financial position, strategy and plans, and our expectations for future operations, including the execution of our restructuring plan and any resulting cost savings, are forward-looking statements. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. The words "believe," "may," "should," "plan," "potential," "project," "will," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "design," "intend," "expect" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. These factors include, among other things,   Declining cash position.   The ability to retain any partial payments of the pending $1.6 million note financing as liquidated damages.   The ability to amend the agreement for the sale of the headquarters.   Our ability to improve our liquidity, access alternative sources of funding and obtain additional equity capital or credit when necessary for our operations, the difficulty of which may increase if our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market.   The inability of our ODM partner or other contract manufacturers to produce products that satisfy our requirements.   Our ability to implement our cost reduction programs and to execute our restructuring plan effectively.   Our ability to improve our gross margins, reduce our net losses and restore our operations to profitability.   Our ability to successfully introduce new products that we can produce and that customers will purchase in such amounts as to be sufficiently profitable to cover the costs of developing and producing these products, as well as providing us additional net income from operations.   Our ability to effectively develop, maintain and expand our sales and distribution channels, especially in the niche LED markets, including the UV LED and architectural lighting that we focus on.   Our ability to successfully manage our operations in the face of the cyclicality, rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence, declining average selling prices and wide fluctuations in supply and demand typically found in the LED market.   Competitive pressures from existing and new companies.   Our ability to grow our revenues generated from the sales of our products and to control our expenses.   Loss of any of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel.   Intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties against us or our customers, including our distributor customers.   The failure of LEDs to achieve widespread adoption in the general lighting market, or if alternative technologies gain market acceptance.   The loss of key suppliers or contract manufacturers.   Our ability to effectively expand or upgrade our production facilities or do so in a timely or cost-effective manner.   Difficulty in managing our future growth or in responding to a need to contract operations, and the associated changes to our operations.   Adverse development in those selected markets, including Taiwan, the United States and China, where our revenues are concentrated.  Table of Contents   Our ability to develop and execute upon a new strategy to exploit the China and India markets.   The reduction or elimination of government investment in LED lighting or the elimination of, or changes in, policies in certain countries that encourage the use of LEDs over some traditional lighting technologies.   Our ability to implement our product innovation strategy effectively, particularly in view of the prohibition against our (and/or our assisting others in) making, using, importing, selling and/or offering to sell in the United States our accused products and/or any device that includes an accused product after October 1, 2012 as a result of the injunction agreed to in connection with the Cree Inc., or Cree, litigation.   Loss of customers.   Failure of our strategy of marketing and selling our products in jurisdictions with limited intellectual property enforcement regimes.   Lack of marketing and distribution success by our third-party distributors.   Our customers' ability to produce and sell products incorporating our LED products.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We have not assumed any obligation to, and you should not expect us to, update or revise these statements because of new information, future events or otherwise.  For more information on the significant risks that could affect the outcome of these forward-looking statements, see Item 1A "Risk Factors" in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, or the 2016 Annual Report, and those contained in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report, and other information provided from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes and other information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, in our 2016 Annual Report, and in other filings with the SEC.  Table of Contents  Company Overview  We develop, manufacture and sell light emitting diode (LED) chips and LED components. Our products are used primarily for general lighting applications, including street lights and commercial, industrial and residential lighting. Our LED chips may also be used in specialty industrial applications, such as ultraviolet, or UV, curing of polymers, LED light therapy in medical/cosmetic applications, counterfeit detection, LED lighting for horticulture applications, architectural lighting and entertainment lighting.  Utilizing our patented and proprietary technology, our manufacturing process begins by growing upon the surface of a sapphire wafer, or substrate, several very thin separate semiconductive crystalline layers of gallium nitride, or GaN, a process known as epitaxial growth, on top of which a mirror-like reflective silver layer is then deposited. After the subsequent addition of a copper alloy layer and finally the removal of the sapphire substrate, we further process this multiple-layered material to create individual vertical LED chips.  We package our LED chips into LED components, which we sell to distributors and a customer base that is heavily concentrated in a few select markets, including Taiwan, the United States and China (including Hong Kong). We also sell our "Enhanced Vertical," or EV, LED product series in blue, white, green and UV in selected markets. We sell our LED chips to packagers or to distributors, who in turn sell to packagers. Our lighting products customers are primarily original design manufacturers, or ODMs, of lighting products and the end�users of lighting devices. We also contract other manufacturers to produce for our sale certain LED products, and for certain aspects of our product fabrication, assembly and packaging processes, based on our design and technology requirements and under our quality control specifications and final inspection process.  We have developed advanced capabilities and proprietary know-how in:   reusing sapphire substrate in subsequent production runs;   optimizing our epitaxial growth processes to create layers that efficiently convert electrical current into light;   employing a copper alloy base manufacturing technology to improve our chip's thermal and electrical performance;   utilizing nanoscale surface engineering to improve usable light extraction;   developing a LED structure that generally consists of multiple epitaxial layers which are vertically-stacked on top of a copper alloy base; and   developing low cost Chip Scaled Packaging (CSP) technology.  These technical capabilities enable us to produce LED chips and LED component products. We entered into a Foundry Services and Licensing Agreement with an ODM partner in December 2015 to assist us with the restructuring of our chips manufacturing operations. We granted our ODM partner a royalty-free, non-transferable, nonexclusive license to use our technology and intellectual property for internal use by the ODM partner's employees at its facilities for the purpose of manufacturing, testing and supplying us its products. The ODM partner is working with us to enable it to ODM vertical chips for us using our vertical technology. We believe these capabilities, know-how and partnership should also allow us to reduce our manufacturing costs and our dependence on sapphire, a costly raw material used in the production of sapphire-based LED devices.  We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 4, 2005 and sold our first LED chips in November 2005. We are a holding company for various wholly owned subsidiaries. SemiLEDs Optoelectronics Co., Ltd., or Taiwan SemiLEDs, is our wholly owned operating subsidiary, where a substantial portion of our assets are held and located, where a portion of our research, development, manufacturing and sales activities take place. Taiwan SemiLEDs owns a 100% equity interest in Taiwan Bandaoti Zhaoming Co., Ltd., formerly known as Silicon Base Development, Inc., which is engaged in the research, development, manufacture, and substantial portion of marketing and sale of LED products, and where most of our employees are based.  Key Factors Affecting Our Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Business  The following are key factors that we believe affect our financial condition, results of operations and business:   Our ability to raise additional debt funding, sell additional equity securities and improve our liquidity. We need to improve our liquidity, access alternative sources of funding and obtain additional equity capital or credit when necessary for our operations. However, we may not be able to obtain such debt funding or sell equity securities on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The raising of additional debt funding by us, if required and available, would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financing covenants, or liens on our assets, that would  Table of Contents  restrict our operations. The sale of additional equity securities, if required and available, could result in dilution to our stockholders.   Our ability to outsource manufacturing and our ability to get chips from other chip suppliers. Our reliance on our new ODM partner exposes us to a number of significant risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance and production costs, lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply, and the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the contract manufacturer because of factors beyond our control. For example, both parties are waiting for the qualification for the chip products manufactured by the ODM partner using their facilities. The delay for delivering products on time at a satisfactory level of quality has resulted in difficulties for fulfilling our customer orders. As a consequence, our revenues attributable to the sales of our LED chips declined. If our ODM partner were to become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture our products at requested quality, quantity, performance and costs, or in a timely manner, our business and reputation could be seriously harmed. As a result, we would have to attempt to identify and qualify substitute manufacturers, which could be time consuming and difficult, and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. Our inability to procure chips from other chip suppliers at the desired quality, quantity, performance and cost might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. In such events, our customer relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.   Industry growth and demand for products and applications using LEDs. The overall adoption of LED lighting devices to replace traditional lighting sources is expected to influence the growth and demand for LED chips and component products and impact our financial performance. We believe the potential market for LED lighting will continue to expand. LEDs for efficient generation of UV light are also starting to gain attention for various medical, germicidal and industrial applications. Since a substantial portion of our LED chips, LED components and our lighting products are used by end- users in general lighting applications and specialty industrial applications such as UV curing, medical/cosmetic, counterfeit detection, horticulture, architectural lighting and entertainment lighting the adoption of LEDs into these applications will have a strong impact on the demand of LED chips generally and, as a result, for our LED chips, LED components and LED lighting products.   Average selling price of our products. The average selling price of our products may decline for a variety of factors, including prices charged by our competitors, the efficacy of our products, our cost basis, changes in our product mix, the size of the order and our relationship with the relevant customer, as well as general market and economic conditions. Competition in the markets for LED products is intense, and we expect that competition will continue to increase, thereby creating a highly aggressive pricing environment. For example, some of our competitors have in the past reduced their average selling prices, and the resulting competitive pricing pressures have caused us to similarly reduce our prices, accelerating the decline in our revenues and the gross margin of our products. When prices decline, we must also write down the value of our inventory. Furthermore, the average selling prices for our LED products have typically decreased over product life cycles. Therefore, our ability to continue to innovate and offer competitive products that meet our customers' specifications and pricing requirements, such as higher efficacy LED products at lower costs, will have a material influence on our ability to improve our revenues and product margins, although in the near term the introduction of such higher performance LED products may further reduce the selling prices of our existing products or render them obsolete.   Changes in our product mix. We anticipate that our gross margins will continue to fluctuate from period to period as a result of the mix of products that we sell and the utilization of our manufacturing capacity in any given period, among other things. For example, we continue to pursue opportunities for profitable growth in areas of business where we see the best opportunity to develop as an end-to-end LED module solution supplier by providing our customers with high quality, flexible and more complete LED system solution, customer technical support and LED module/system design, as opposed to just providing customers with individual components. As a strategic plan, we have placed greater emphasis on the sales of LED components rather than the sales of LED chips where we have been forced to cut prices on older inventory. Steadily growth of the module product and the continued commercial sales of our UV LED product are expected to improve our gross margin, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we have adjusted the lower-priced LED components strategy as appropriate. We have adopted a strategy to adjust our product mix by exiting certain high volume but low unit selling price product lines in response to the general trend of lower average selling prices for products that have been available in the market for some time. However, as we expand and diversify our product offerings and with varying average selling prices, or execute new business initiatives, a change in the mix of products that we sell in any given period may increase volatility in our revenues and gross margin from period to period.   Our ability to reduce cost to offset lower average selling prices. Competitors may reduce average selling prices faster than our ability to reduce costs, and competitive pricing pressures may accelerate the rate of decline of our average selling prices. To address increased pricing pressure, we have improved and increased our production yields to reduce the per-unit cost of production of our products. However, such cost savings currently have limited impact on our gross profit, as  Table of Contents  we currently suffer from the underutilization of manufacturing capacity and must absorb a high level of fixed costs, such as depreciation. We are moving toward a fabless business model in which we would utilize foundry fabs to ODM our chips using our developed technology. As part of the restructuring, we continue to explore opportunities to sell our chip manufacturing equipment to our ODM partner or others, which will help us to reduce the idle capacity costs. While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term we expect to be required to invest substantially in LED component products development and production equipment if we are to grow.   Our ability to continue to innovate. As part of our growth strategy, we plan to continue to be innovative in product design, to deliver new products and to improve our manufacturing efficiencies. Our continued success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new, technologically advanced and lower cost products, such as more efficient, better performance LED component products. If we are unable to introduce new products that are commercially viable and meet rapidly evolving customer requirements or keep pace with evolving technological standards and market developments or are otherwise unable to execute our product innovation strategy effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise, execute our business plan or be able to compete effectively. In August 2015, we launched two UV COB module products: D4525 and D4825. These high density UV modules are suggested to be driven at 120W and 200W respectively with efficient thermal management. To differentiate ourselves from other LED package manufacturers, we are putting more resources towards module and system design. Along with our technical know-how in the chip and package sectors, we are able to further integrate electrical, thermal and mechanical manufacturing resources to provide customers with one-stop system services. Services include design, prototyping, OEM and ODM. Key markets that we intend to target at the system end include different types of UV LED industrial printers, aquarium lighting, medical applications, niche imaging light engines, horticultural lighting and high standard commercial lighting. The modules are designed for various printing, curing, and PCB exposure industrial equipments, providing uncompromised reliability and optical output. Our LED components include different sizes and wattage to accommodate different demands in the LED market.   General economic conditions and geographic concentration. Many countries including the United States and the European Union (the "E.U.") members have instituted, or have announced plans to institute, government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency in lighting. These actions include in certain cases banning the sale after specified dates of certain forms of incandescent lighting, which are advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as LEDs. The global financial crisis that began in late 2007 caused extreme disruption in the financial markets. Although the disruption in the financial markets moderated thereafter, the global financial markets continue to reflect uncertainty about a sustained economic recovery. When the global economy slows or a financial crisis occurs, consumer and government confidence declines, with levels of government grants and subsidies for LED adoption and consumer spending likely to be adversely impacted. Our revenues have been concentrated in a few select markets, including Taiwan, the United States and China (including Hong Kong). Given that we are operating in a rapidly changing industry, our sales in specific markets may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Therefore, our financial results will be impacted by general economic and political conditions in such markets. For example, the aggressive support by the Chinese government for the LED industry through significant government incentives and subsidies to encourage the use of LED lighting and to establish the LED-sector companies has resulted in production overcapacity in the market and intense competition. Furthermore, due to Chinese package manufacturers increasing usage of domestic LED chips, prices are increasingly competitive, leading to Chinese manufacturers growing market share in the global LED industry. In addition, we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. Some of our largest customers and what we produce/have produced for them have changed from quarter to quarter primarily as a result of the timing of discrete, large project-based purchases and broadening customer base, among other things. For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, sales to our three largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for 58% and 50% of our revenues, respectively.   Intellectual property issues. Competitors of ours and other third parties have in the past and will likely from time to time in the future allege that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending against any intellectual property infringement claims would likely result in costly litigation and ultimately may lead to our not being able to manufacture, use or sell products found to be infringing. In June 2012, we settled an intellectual property dispute involving Cree. We agreed to dismiss amended complaints filed against each other without prejudice. We agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction that was effective October 1, 2012 that precludes us from (and/or from assisting others in) making, using, importing, selling and/or offering to sell in the United States certain accused products and/or any device that includes such an accused product after that date and to payment of a settlement fee for past damages. All accused products sold before the date of settlement are released under this agreement and our customers and distributors are specifically released. All remaining claims between Cree and us were withdrawn without prejudice, with each retaining the right to assert them in the future. However, other third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers with respect to our products, or our customers' products that incorporate our technologies or products. Any  Table of Contents  such legal action or the threat of legal action against us, or our customers, could impair such customers' continued demand for our products. This could prevent us from growing or even maintaining our revenues, or cause us to incur additional costs and expenses, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.   Declining cash position. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased to $3.1 million as of May 31, 2017 primarily due to the combination of our net cash used in operating activities and payments related to long-term debt. We have implemented actions to accelerate operating cost reductions and improve operational efficiencies. The plan is further enhanced through the fabless business model in which we implemented certain workforce reductions and are exploring opportunities to sell certain equipment related to the manufacturing of vertical LED chips to our ODM partner or others, in order to reduce the idle capacity charges, minimize our research and development activities associated with chips manufacturing operation. We believe we will be able to generate positive cash inflows through the restructuring of our chip operation and the significant ongoing cost savings in the form of reduced payroll and research and development activities. The shipment of our new module product and the continued commercial sales of our UV LED product are expected to grow steadily. Based on our current financial projections, we believe that we will have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our operations and capital expenditure plans for the next 12 months.

COMPANY PROFILE: SemiLEDs Corporation








SemiLEDs, a US corporation with operations in Taiwan, describes itself as the only metal vertical LED chip manufacturer.


Published on:Sep 17, 2008











































SemiLEDs Corporation is one of the world’s leading providers of high-performance LEDs. SemiLEDs is the only manufacturer of vertical LEDs on a metal alloy substrate; the MvPLED™. 

These devices are fabricated using SemiLEDs’ proprietary and patented technologies. MvPLED™ is the next generation of high-power LED for solid-state lighting applications.

Why MvPLED™?

SemiLEDs’ chip has been optimally designed, solving common problems of many conventional LEDs, such as thermal management and current spreading. With our breakthrough technology and innovation, our LED chips deliver better performance, capable of more than 100 lm/W at 350mA driving current. 

The vertical design of the chip directs current in a straight path from the top n-contact to the bottom p-contact, preventing current crowding. This improves the efficiency at higher currents and allows for chip scaling with maintained performance levels. 

To improve thermal management, the metal alloy substrate was specifically designed with its high thermal conductivity at 400 W/m-K, maximizing operating current and output power. Together, these properties allow the MvPLED™ to operate in extreme conditions that are less suitable for conventional LEDs on sapphire or other materials. 

SemiLEDs’ MvPLED™ devices are fabricated with a thinned n-GaN up structure that enhances light output efficiency and maximizes the vertical injection of current into the device’s active layer. 

With the vertical structure and ultra-thin GaN, MvpLED devices exhibit a nearly perfect Lambertian light emission pattern.  SemiLEDs’ MvPLED™ light output is further optimized to have a maximized effective emitting area.

Applications and Products

SemiLEDs offers LED chips appropriate for general lighting, architectural, medical, automotive, and LCD backlight unit applications.  The MvPLED™ can be used up to 5 Watt applications. Current products are available in wavelengths ranging from near UV, blue and green. Please contact sales@semileds.com for any inquiries. 

About the Company

SemiLEDs Corporation is one of the world’s leading providers of high-performance LEDs suitable for general lighting applications. SemiLEDs’ LED chips are among the brightest and the most efficient in the market today. 

Utilizing a copper alloy substrate, SemiLEDs has successfully developed and commercialized  MvPLED™ technology (Metal vertical Photon Light Emitting Diode). With metal substrate and unique device structure, SemiLEDs’ MvPLED™ has better electrical and thermal conductivity; increasing brightness, efficiency, and better heat transfer. 

SemiLEDs’ MvPLED™ chips are suitable for lighting applications including display, signage, communication, automotive, and general lighting. One of our goals is to initiate a Solid State Lighting revolution. 

SemiLEDs is a U.S. corporation backed by multi-billion-dollar companies. The company is headquartered in Boise, Idaho with operations in Hsinchu, Taiwan.
