Our BusinessesLuna Labs – Applied Research & Development



Luna’s Applied R&D brings a broad diversity of technology and multi-disciplinary talent to the product development process. We evaluate and address problems from numerous perspectives and are not limited to one or two basic technologies. Because of our diverse R&D organization, and the experience we have gained building it, we can first determine the ideal solution to a particular challenge and then create the team to deliver it.
Our approach to product commercialization is similarly flexible. We seek individualized transition strategies for each product that will satisfy the customer and create the most value for our stakeholders. Typical strategies include

conversion of unique R&D into successful and mature multi-million dollar product lines that are manufactured, marketed and sold under the LUNA brand,
entry into supply agreements with leading original equipment manufacturers,
licensing of intellectual property and know-how to a partner that can rapidly bring the technology to multiple markets, and
sale of technology to partners that are well-positioned in a specific target market.

Developmental Products
Luna’s Applied R&D will often make first generation products available for purchase by early adopters while the best transition strategy can be determined and executed. These products remain under the Luna Applied R&D umbrella. Current examples include:

the TrueClot® line of hemorrhage control products
the Luna Sensor Suite for Aircraft (LS2A) Corrosion Monitoring
3D Shape & Positioning Sensing

Luna Innovations Incorporated, incorporated on April 4, 2003, develops, manufactures and markets fiber optic sensing and test, and measurement products. The Company is focused on bringing technology solutions to measure and monitor processes in the aerospace, automotive, energy, composite, telecommunications and defense industries. The Company operates in two business segments: Products and Licensing, and Technology Development. The Products and Licensing segment develops, manufactures and markets its suite of products, including high-speed optical receiver (HSOR), custom optoelectronic subsystems (Optoelectronics), and Terahertz (THz) products, and fiber optic sensing, as well as test and measurement products. The Technology Development segment performs applied research principally in the areas of sensing and instrumentation, advanced materials and health sciences.Products and LicensingThe Company's Products and Licensing segment includes test and measurement, sensing, and instrumentation products; Optoelectronic Solutions, and THz Sensing systems. Its product lines in the test and measurement domain include Optical Vector Analyzer (OVA), Optical Backscatter Reflectometer (OBR) and the Phoenix family of tunable lasers. The Company's test and measurement products monitor the integrity of fiber optic network components and sub-assemblies. Manufacturers and suppliers of optical components and modules use a combination of various types of optical test equipment to identify and measure failures in optical networks, such as bad splices, bends, crimps and other reflective and non-reflective events that can cause defects and negatively impact product performance.OBR is a sensitive diagnostic device, which has application in the telecommunications industry and provides measurements in various other applications. The OBR also has a feature that allows users to turn standard optical fiber into multiple sensors that could be used in a range of temperature measurement and monitoring applications, including power generation, civil structure monitoring, industrial process control; component-level heating in optical amplifiers, strain and load distribution measurements of aircraft harnesses, and temperature monitoring inside telecommunications cabinets and enclosures. The Company also offers ODiSI, a sensing platform. These products provide distributed strain or temperature measurements and deliver data by using an optical fiber as a continuous sensor for approximately 50 meters of surface.The Company's HSOR transmission products are deployed in the Internet communications equipment infrastructure to enable the high-speed bandwidth necessary to support video and data for television, computers, tablets or smart phones anytime and anywhere. Its communication test and measurement products are used to develop, manufacture and test optical communication components and equipment used in the telecom/datacom infrastructure. Its Optoelectronics products are sold to a number of scientific instrumentation manufacturers for various applications, such as metrology, currency validation, flame monitoring, temperature sensing, particle detection, color sensing and infrared detection. The Company's THz systems are used to measure and verify physical properties online and in real-time to reduce raw materials and rework costs in manufacturing processes, as well as to conduct quality control monitoring. It markets THz based products as T-Ray product platform through value added resellers.Technology DevelopmentThe Company provides applied research for customers in a range of areas, including sensing and materials, such as nanomaterials, coatings, adhesives, composites and bio-engineered materials. The Company has developed a range of coatings, including both hydrophobic and superoleophobic coatings. Its nanomaterials activity is focused on fullerenes and tri-metal nitride endohedral fullerene (Trimetasphere) materials. The Technology Development segment also performs applied research towards developing new sensors, such as sensors for the purpose of corrosion, temperature, strain, pressure, structural health and chemical detection.

BLACKSBURG — When My Chung was named the CEO of Luna Innovations Inc., he brought with him a new, streamlined vision for the company once known for its technology development — in what began to seem like every conceivable field.Three years later, Chung has abandoned some projects, sold divisions, reworked Luna’s internal structure and even scrapped the old logo. Now, he says Luna is the focused tech company “it should have been all along, but it wasn’t.”When Chung came on board in 2011 the Roanoke-based firm had scientists going after federal research grants in about a dozen different fields, ranging from cyber security to military uniforms that don’t get dirty. According to Chung, the strategy back then was to “chase anything that moves.”“The surprise to me once I got in was how diverse this company was in not necessarily a good way,” he said. “It’s the diversity that limits the investment in any one particular area. I’m a single-focused guy. I grew up that way. You go find a technology, you find a market and you go after it. You don’t start with 20.”Back then, Luna was emerging from bankruptcy and still recovering from a $36 million lawsuit that almost destroyed the company.Luna still hasn’t posted an annual profit since 2004, but things are headed in the right direction. Last year, Luna lost $800,000, which is a turnaround compared to the $9.4 million loss in 2006.Chung said he expects Luna to stay in the red for a couple more years, but he hopes the company will “turn the corner” by 2016.Advancing its sensing technologyBy then, Chung said Luna won’t be the research-focused company it has been since it was founded in 1990. Instead, it will be product-driven — one product, to be more specific: strain- and temperature-sensing equipment.The technology uses fiber optic cables to test for defects in composite materials, including the metals used in spacecraft and automobiles.The cables are laid over a composite material, like the wing of an airplane. Engineers then apply weight to the wing. As it bends under the stress, Luna’s ODiSI, or Optical Distributed Sensor Interrogator, measures the amount of strain different parts are experiencing. It can also sense slight changes in temperature in the metal.This data can be used to search for defects in the material and to identify weaknesses in the wing before it’s in the sky.Chung said Luna’s approach to strain testing is easier to use and more accurate and cost effective than strain gauges already in the market today. The company released its first commercial product in 2011 and followed it up with a version 2.0 in 2012.Luna’s sales force is still working to get its foot in the door with corporations like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, but Chung said success means getting in on a target annual market of about $350 million to $400 million.Asked if he was nervous about hanging the company’s future on one technology, Chung said not at all.“You have to have done enough market research to know how big the market is and how you’ll differentiate,” he said. “In these past couple years, we’ve done a lot of work understanding that. We’ve had wins. That reinforces our belief that we’re in the right space.”Becoming a products companyGoing through a list of divisions that used to make up the company, it becomes clear just how different the Luna of today is from decades past.Luna Energy, which made sensors for the oil industry, “no longer exists,” Chung said; Luna iMonitoring, which made wireless sensors for a variety of applications, “doesn’t really exist”; Luna Quest, which developed cancer drugs, “doesn’t exist.”With the sale of its medical shape-sensing business earlier this year, the company now has just two business segments: the research and development of the sensing technology and the group dedicated to selling it for use in aerospace, automotive, energy, defense and telecommunications markets.
But according to Chung, that’s the way it had to be since Luna is a publicly traded company.He said his predecessor, founder and former CEO Kent Murphy, got the “IPO bug” back in 2006, when startups everywhere were cashing in on stock market booms.Murphy took the company public that year, selling shares at $6 apiece. But the initial public offering didn’t raise as much money as he had hoped and by September it was the 11th-worst-performing new stock in the country.Today, Luna’s stock is hovering around $1.50 a share.“It was an ego thing. It was a mistake,” Chung said. “In the end, I say the company was not ready to do an IPO. But once you’ve done it, it’s hard to unravel it. To make sure the shareholders that got in during the IPO don’t get washed out, it’s our job to make this thing successful.”Attempts to reach Murphy for this story were unsuccessful.Chung said public investors aren’t looking for research companies that hatch ideas and sell them for someone else to commercialize. They want product companies.So he had two options: delist from the stock exchange, a move he refused to make because it would devastate early investors, or turn Luna into a products company.He chose the latter.“Think about the shareholders who got in early on,” Chung said. “It was $6 to $9 a share. Today they’re underwater at [$1.50]. And so if you get delisted and you’re now a penny stock, that’s a big gap.“Today, at least they can trade it. They’re not selling it because they don’t want to sell at a loss. But some people have gotten out. But they see hope that this stock will come back up to the point where it is a value. … I have to turn this into an exciting stock for people to own. It’s delivering on that products story. That we’re in a market, it’s big, we have a competitive advantage. It has the opportunity; it has the future to make this an exciting stock.”

Vision
To be a leader in optical technology, providing unique capabilities in high speed optoelectronics and high performance fiber optic test products for the telecommunications industry and distributed fiber optic sensing for the aerospace and automotive industries.
Our history
Luna Innovations Incorporated (NASDAQ: LUNA) was founded in 1990 and has been successful in taking innovative technologies from the applied research stage to product development and ultimately to the commercial market. In some cases, the successes led to the creation of independent businesses. We have created companies in our area of focus, sold some of them to industry leaders in their fields, raised private capital, formed joint ventures and entered into a number of licensing agreements.
We are a Virginia-based company with a diverse team of scientists, engineers, and business professionals developing and manufacturing a new generation of technologies and products. Operating in 4 locations across Virginia, we employ a disciplined and integrated business model designed to accelerate the process of bringing innovative solutions to market.

Luna Innovations, Inc.: Success Story




Luna Innovations, Inc.: Success Story



Sep 15, 2015                     	
Source: SBIR Success Stories (click here to go to the source)
Landing a jet fighter on an aircraft carrier is often cited as one of the most perilous maneuvers Naval and Marine Corps pilots will ever have to perform. Throw in unpredictable weather conditions, like wind and rain, that often cloud the windshield and reduce visibility, and now the task is even more arduous. The U.S. Navy sought a solution by releasing a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) solicitation to develop a durable rain repellent coating for aircraft that would increase visibility during takeoff and landing. Virginia-based Luna Innovations won the SBIR award and went on to develop a proven solution that could work on any type of hard surface. A Phase II project soon followed, and it wasn't long before the Air Force signed on to partner with Luna on an F-16 canopy application. "We looked at the potential for the technology, and knew it was something the military needed, but the possibilities were also very broad commercially," explains Luna Innovations CEO My E. Chung. "We have leveraged multiple SBIR awards to develop and advance this technology, and that was one of the keys to our success." Recognizing the need to find the right partner to bring the technology to market, Luna licensed the durable surface transparent coating to UltraTech International for multiple commercial applications under the tradename Gentoo™ coatings. Licensing is a key revenue generator for the company, bringing in $9.1 million in 2014; a 31% increase from the previous year. A potential application Luna is exploring for its related omni-phobic (water and oil repellent) textile coating technology, licensed to UltraTech under the EverShield™ name, is in the area of Army uniforms. The Depar™ent of Defense is exploring options for use in the battlefield to keep water, oil and other fluids off the soldiers' uniforms. This textile application could have broad commercial potential, especially within the multi-billion dollar U.S. laundry industry. Although Luna creates and develops a broad range of technologies across multiple platforms including sensors, materials, and health sciences, it has built its reputation by being the preeminent developer and manufacturer of fiber optic solutions to clients within the telecommunications, medical, energy, aerospace, automotive, defense and composites industries. In the fiber optic arena, Luna provides diagnostic and test instrumentation for the telecommunications industry, enabling complete characterization of optical components, assemblies and short-haul networks. The company's solutions provide cost and time savings in development, production and maintenance of next-generation optical equipment. Drawing from this core competency, Luna developed a patented process to track the shape of the fiber. This process ended up having huge commercial potential in the robotic surgical industry, since the tip of the fiber could communicate to the doctor exactly where that instrument was within a patient, say for example at the end of a catheter. It eliminates the need for patients to be hooked up to X-rays and MRIs during surgical procedures, creating an unparalleled value proposition to both the doctor and the patient. In 2014 Luna sold its medical shape-sensing technology to Intuitive Surgical in a deal valued up to $30 million. "That's really the value of our team; we look at the market perspective," explains James Garrett, Vice President of Technology Development for Luna Innovations. "We have built a very strong research institution, and have refined our focus and recently have added marketing capabilities to our technology development division. That was a major shift in how we approach things -- how are we going to take these efforts and commercialize them? That question is shaping the whole strategy of our division." Another part of that strategy centered on a recent merger with Advanced Photonix, Inc. (API), to better position Luna for improved profitability. The combined company, which retained the Luna name, has significant intellectual property protection for the many technologies in its combined product portfolio, with over 200 patents and patent applications. With a shared vision, the decision to merge was a relatively simple one, as the merged company can now offer a more comprehensive and therefore a more compelling value proposition to the industries it serves. Luna is looking forward to a bright and successful future. "The merger with API gives us a real kick start with a solid vision in terms of continually expanding and marketing our core technologies," added Chung. Led by Garrett, the technology division is honing in on commercial applications and opportunities that help the company to guide its selections in the SBIR sector. One of those selections continues to draw upon Luna's coating technologies for a recent SBIR Phase II project with the Navy. The fleet's cable strands used to tow the AQS-20A Minehunting Sonar System from the ship are made from a type of stainless steel that, under normal circumstances, exhibits excellent corrosion resistance and strength over a wide temperature range. However, the cables are experiencing early life corrosion problems due to salt water deposit buildup that occurs over repeated operations and subsequent system stowage. To achieve the corrosion and abrasion resistance necessary for the AQS-20A tow cable, Luna is collaborating with Lockheed Martin to develop a hydrophobic water shedding coating that is mechanically durable, optically transparent, and easy to apply. And while revenue stemming from research and development accounts for 30% of Luna's revenue, the team understands the importance of bringing a product to market. "If you look at some of the largest research entities in the country over history, those companies are a shell of what they used to be because it is extremely expensive to perform just research; you have to learn to commercialize," explains Chung. "That is why the SBIR program is critical. The government has stepped in and provided funding for pure research. It allows us to afford a research team. We will continue to leverage that; it is great source of future products and technologies." In summary, Luna Innovations provides unique capabilities and instrumentation for the telecommunications industry and for distributed fiber optic sensing. Luna's products divisions currently account for the majority of their revenue, but the technology division is leveraging the SBIR program to build and maintain a strong portfolio of diverse research and development to help drive the next phase of company growth.

Luna Innovations Incorporated is a company that develops and manufactures products for the medical, telecommunications, energy and defense markets. It is headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia. Luna's products are used to measure, monitor, protect and improve processes.
Luna Technologies is a division of Luna Innovations specializing in Luna-branded products for fiber optic testing of components, modules and networks, as well as integrated optics and distributed sensing solutions. Their fiber optic test and measurement devices include optical analyzers, reflectometers, tunable lasers, optical switches and customized systems for strain, temperature, shape and position sensing.
Luna's nanoWorks Division is developing nanomedicines for diagnostic and therapeutic applications using Luna's exclusive carbon nanomaterials, including the Trimetasphere.
Luna's Technology Development Division works with government agencies on technology development in four core areas: sensors and systems (fiber optics and ultrasonics); health sciences; and advanced materials including corrosion inhibitors, self-cleaning and self-healing coatings, impact indicators, flame retardant additives and nanomaterials; and secure computing using hardware-based anti-tamper technologies.
Luna Innovations was founded by an electrical engineering professor at Virginia Tech and was originally headquartered in Blacksburg, Virginia. It moved its headquarters to Roanoke in September 2006. Luna Innovations has four locations across Virginia: Blacksburg, Roanoke, Danville and Charlottesville.
Two companies developed from Luna Innovations have been sold to other companies. Luna Energy, which developed pipeline monitoring sensors for the oil and gas industry, was acquired by oil field services firm Baker Hughes. Luna i-Monitoring, which developed a suite of integrated wireless sensors for remote monitoring for the oil and gas industry, was acquired by IHS Energy.
Also of note is that Luna recently merged with Advanced Photonix thus increasing its available products and patents for future products.
Luna Innovations had an initial public offering in June 2006 with the NASDAQ trading symbol LUNA.
