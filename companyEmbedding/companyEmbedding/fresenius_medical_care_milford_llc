Manufacturing[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care operates more than 40 production sites on all continents. Its largest plants in terms of production output are in the U.S. (Ogden, Utah, and Concord, California), Germany (Schweinfurt and St. Wendel), and Japan (Buzen). These plants are categorized as large and small with 25 large facilities and 15 small ones worldwide which cater to local demand for dialysis products.[3] Plants that fall under the concentrates division, manufacture finished products from raw materials, such as sodium chloride, dextrose, and magnesium, to name a few. Raw materials go through a complex mixing and packaging process.
Devices[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care manufactures a variety of durable medical devices used in the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Devices include Hemodialysis Machines, Peritoneal Dialysis Machines, Granuflo Concentrate Mixing Tanks and monitoring devices including the Crit-line device. The dialysis machines are manufactured in one of two plants to serve the globe. These plants are located in Schweinfurt, Germany and Concord, California. Crit-line devices are manufactured in Concord, California.
Distribution[edit]
Distribution is where the finished product, from Manufacturing, comes in on Semi-Trucks to be distributed to dialysis clinics, hospitals, and home dialysis patients. These products are then used in the dialysis process.
On 30 October 2006, the manufacturing facility (Fresenius Hemocare) in Redmond, Washington was shut down. Fresenius Hemocare has stopped going by the name Fresenius Hemocare and now goes by the name Fresenius-Kabi LLC. The closing of one of two entities inside of Hemocare allowed for the name change and takes Hemocare from the Medical Care group to the Kabi group.
In 2012, Fresenius acquired Liberty Dialysis Holdings, in a deal which entailed the sale of its outpatient dialysis clinics in 43 local markets within the U.S.
In 2013, Fresenius Medical Care NA acquired Shiel Medical Laboratory Inc, expanding services to New York City metro area.[citation needed]
Dialysis Units[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care Renal Services Limited runs 54 dialysis units across England[4] and more across Wales. In September 2014 new renal dialysis units run by Fresenius were opened at Withybush General Hospital and West Wales General Hospital, with a contract to run for at least 7 years.[5]

Manufacturing[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care operates more than 40 production sites on all continents. Its largest plants in terms of production output are in the U.S. (Ogden, Utah, and Concord, California), Germany (Schweinfurt and St. Wendel), and Japan (Buzen). These plants are categorized as large and small with 25 large facilities and 15 small ones worldwide which cater to local demand for dialysis products.[3] Plants that fall under the concentrates division, manufacture finished products from raw materials, such as sodium chloride, dextrose, and magnesium, to name a few. Raw materials go through a complex mixing and packaging process.
Devices[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care manufactures a variety of durable medical devices used in the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Devices include Hemodialysis Machines, Peritoneal Dialysis Machines, Granuflo Concentrate Mixing Tanks and monitoring devices including the Crit-line device. The dialysis machines are manufactured in one of two plants to serve the globe. These plants are located in Schweinfurt, Germany and Concord, California. Crit-line devices are manufactured in Concord, California.
Distribution[edit]
Distribution is where the finished product, from Manufacturing, comes in on Semi-Trucks to be distributed to dialysis clinics, hospitals, and home dialysis patients. These products are then used in the dialysis process.
On 30 October 2006, the manufacturing facility (Fresenius Hemocare) in Redmond, Washington was shut down. Fresenius Hemocare has stopped going by the name Fresenius Hemocare and now goes by the name Fresenius-Kabi LLC. The closing of one of two entities inside of Hemocare allowed for the name change and takes Hemocare from the Medical Care group to the Kabi group.
In 2012, Fresenius acquired Liberty Dialysis Holdings, in a deal which entailed the sale of its outpatient dialysis clinics in 43 local markets within the U.S.
In 2013, Fresenius Medical Care NA acquired Shiel Medical Laboratory Inc, expanding services to New York City metro area.[citation needed]
Dialysis Units[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care Renal Services Limited runs 54 dialysis units across England[4] and more across Wales. In September 2014 new renal dialysis units run by Fresenius were opened at Withybush General Hospital and West Wales General Hospital, with a contract to run for at least 7 years.[5]
