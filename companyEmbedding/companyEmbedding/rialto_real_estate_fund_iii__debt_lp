Fitch Upgrades Rialto Capital Advisors Special Servicer Rating 
The upgrade of RCA's special servicer rating reflects Fitch's assessment of the company's servicing abilities, improved control environment, and continued investment in its technology platform relative to a significant increase in named CMBS special servicing. At March 31, 2014, the company was named on 30 CMBS transactions totaling $36.1 billion.











Fund Management
Rialto Real Estate Fund I
Rialto Capital raised $700 million for its first opportunistic real estate fund, Rialto Real Estate Fund, LP, which closed in November 2011. The Fund’s investment objective is to provide its Partners with superior, risk-adjusted returns by focusing on real estate opportunities of all types that meet the Fund’s targeted return and arise from dislocations in the U.S. real estate markets. The Fund seeks to deliver these returns through its abilities to source, underwrite, price, turnaround, and ultimately seek to monetize distressed real estate assets in markets across the United States. The bulk of those opportunities center on investments in distressed or what Rialto believes are advantageously priced real estate debt. Investor’s equity is fully invested as of January 2013.
Rialto Real Estate Fund II
Rialto Capital raised $1.305 billion for its second opportunistic real estate fund, Rialto Real Estate Fund II, LP, which had its final closing in December 2013. Fund II’s objective during its commitment period is to acquire and manage distressed and other value-add real estate assets, as well as related investments that fit Fund II’s investment parameters.
