Company overview
Alliance One International is a leading independent leaf tobacco merchant serving the world's cigarette manufacturers. The company was formed on May 13, 2005, as a result of the merger of DIMON Incorporated and Standard Commercial Corporation, both world leaders in tobacco processing. The creation of Alliance One brings together 200 years of combined experience and expertise, establishing a formidable competitor with a clear focus on its customers, as well as a vision for the future.
Alliance One selects, purchases, processes, packs, stores, and ships leaf tobacco. In certain developing markets, we also provide agronomy expertise and financing for the growing of leaf tobacco. Alliance One neither manufactures nor sells cigarettes or other consumer tobacco products. Our shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AOI.

Quality Leaf
Alliance One is a contractor, processor and supplier of Flue-Cured, Burley, Oriental, Sun-Cured, Dark Air-Cured and Dark Fire-Cured tobaccos. Our long-standing relationships with growers and industry stakeholders around the world is built off generations of history. Those relationships, combined with the expansive knowledge of our worldwide staff, ensures we have the ability to deliver a sustainable, compliant supply of tobacco that meets individual customer requirements.
Our Purchasing Network

Alliance One purchases the vast majority of its tobacco through direct contracts with growers. Under the direct contract buying system (otherwise called the Integrated Production System), purchasers generally buy a grower's entire tobacco crop. Alliance One works closely with our customers in advance of the crop to estimate their requirements, and we use these estimates as the basis to contract tobaccos directly from growers. In this system, we assume the risk of matching the quantities and grades needed by our customers to the entire crop we must purchase under contract.  
Our arrangements with growers vary from locale to locale, depending on our predictions of future supply and demand, local historical practice, and availability of capital. Under longer-term arrangements with growers, we may also finance or guarantee financing on growers' construction of curing barns.
In some tobacco-growing origins, we purchase tobacco at auction markets after receiving specific customer orders or indications of customers' upcoming needs. Our network of tobacco buyers allows us to cover the major auctions of flue-cured and burley tobacco throughout the world. These buyers are experts in differentiating hundreds of grades of tobacco based on customer specifications and preferences that take into account, among other factors, the texture, visual appearance and aroma of the tobacco.

Alliance One International is an international storage, sales, distribution company and is one of the two publicly held independent leaf tobacco merchants in the world.[2] The company generates revenue primarily by selling leaf tobacco and relevant processing fees charged from tobacco manufacturers worldwide.[3] The company’s enterprise value is $1.27 billion.[1][4] The company holds a leading position in the tobacco-producing region with operating more than 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide. Its customer base include the world’s largest tobacco manufacturers in United Kingdom, Japan, China, U.S., Southeast of Asia region and so on.[2]

History[edit]
Alliance One International was established in 2005, as a result of the corporate merger between DIMON Incorporated and Standard Commercial Corporation.[5]
DIMON Incorporated was founded in 1995, and later in 1997 it acquired Intabex Holdings Worldwide, which was the world's fourth-largest leaf merchant at the time. The company’s acquisition of Intabex was considered as the biggest one of that kind in the leaf history. [6]
Standard Commercial Corporation, established in 1910, operated tobacco leaf business in Mediterranean area. It used to be the third-largest leaf merchant of the world prior to the merger of DIMON.[5]
Operations[edit]
In December 2013, the company announced the expiration of its offer to exchange up to $735 million of 9.875% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021.[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
