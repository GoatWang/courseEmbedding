Vision is a Result of Experience




The COMOC Manifesto

                                                            (with apologies to Karl Marx)
                                                            
		                                                    or
		                                                    
The Community-ism Revolution
-Founder Jim Cook's vision for Crown O'Maine, written circa 2006.
                                                            



 
Maine is a place it can happen. As we look around the world we can see that it definitely ain't happenin' in too many places. We are fortunate to
live in a place of great natural resource and beauty with a population small enough and government “grassroots” enough that we can act with reasonable hope
of accomplishment. In our case at hand, “IT” is a community inter-connected through a self-providing food system that results in strong and vibrant local
agriculture.



Contrary to the belief that we must centralize, specialize and globalize to succeed, we see that, whatever else we need to do to survive in this world, we
must be strong, sophisticated and savvy at home. This means locally produced food, shelter and fuel. To have a regionally secure food supply we must have a
strong farming base and strong support at home. Your support at home is what we term “co-production” for without it, nothing happens.



Just as farmers might cozy up to the fire in January and order the inputs for spring planting, your production planning input happens when you can tell your
farmers what you like and how much you would like to purchase. We call this “co-production” because you are valued partners in our vocation of raising crops
for our livelihood.



As the distribution vehicle for many Maine farms (some of them also your more local farms) we are in a great place to interface information about the
“big picture” and coordinate efforts for the next year's production. While it is our philosophy and policy not to compete or interfere
with direct farm to customer sales, our job is to enhance each farm's ability to produce and serve wider markets both in State and New England.



Over the last ten years we have witnessed and taken part in the keen interest Maine residents have for their rural roots and maritime traditions. The
farming and fishing sectors of our Maine economy, however, are struggling. They are struggling because the existing food distribution system is all about
forcing farmers to commodity pricing and maximizing corporate profit.



As small farmers, distributors and neighbors we have a unique opportunity in Maine to do business “as un-usual”.



The most frequently expressed equivocations to buying local products are “I can’t find it” and “I can’t afford it”.



The unspoken excuse is, “it's just too much trouble.”



As we look around the Maine landscape we see the need to take the steps to improve access to local foods at affordable prices. The link COMOC is trying to
forge is improved access to affordable local foods state wide.



Mainers have given enthusiastic reception to the field crops (see Products for complete list) we have been able to provide,
including Maine grown and milled wheat flour. Coordinating production with overall demand is somewhat of a “chicken and egg” magic trick because we are not
(merci a dieu) a large corporate entity with deep pockets. However, we have learned through hard won experience that by working together we can conceive and
produce supply of both our traditional Maine crops and innovative “new crops” such as winter greens and specialty items for the restaurant trade.



Continuing to work together we expect to meet the demand for these products and enable production to go to the next dependable level. The net result of
spending your money to purchase local products is a stronger and more independent local economy.


State-wide Delivery to Buying Clubs at Wholesale Prices.

How this works: Our retail partners (see Retailers) do great job providing 7-day a week access to our products.
To provide this service they need to be able to pay the help, the rent, the taxes, the insurance, etc., etc. Furthermore they have provided Maine’s
small family farms with a viable return for their efforts.

The seeming price disparity, between locally produced, small farm raised organic products in comparison with the food giant’s commodity based produce
and products, is easily dispelled. If we take into account the real cost of industrially produced commodity food including subsidies and hidden health and
environmental costs, locally produce organic food can be seen for the genuine value that it is.



In order to provide people in all walks of life with broader access at a different price level an alternate type of service must be employed. This service
we will call Farm Direct Delivery to Buying Clubs. Implicit in this mechanism is the desire to work in harmony with your local CSA’s to augment
selection and extend seasons for each and every farm.




Order deadlines and delivery schedules will be posted.


Considerations: Experienced buying club members know that managing bulk purchases of perishable and semi-perishable items requires some
forethought and preparation. If you are not equipped and prepared to receive perishable and semi-perishable foodstuffs, it is less expensive to entrust this
responsibility to your neighborhood retailer than to manage the food supply yourself.



We have learned through experience that no one is better equipped or understands storage requirements better than the farmer. COMOC can facilitate the club
members storing and using these items by ensuring a regular delivery schedule. At the outset, we envision delivering every two weeks to any given area. As
we get progressively busier, we may be able to offer certain areas weekly deliveries. We hope this will allow club members to order on a more short-term
basis and help minimize losses.




We started providing this service on Nov.1, 2006. If your CSA offers a winter share we urge you to advocate
with them to source what items they do not produce through us.

SOME HELPFUL ONLINE TOOLS FOR BUYING CLUBS

Yahoo! Groups: This free, online service allows members to reach all other group members easily via
email. It also offers a place to save documents, links, and message archives that all members can access.
The group can also be set up to send automatic reminders for meetings and order deadlines.

Google Documents: This free service is great for compiling orders. All members can be invited to view
and make changes to a document or spreadsheet simultaneously, and all changes are traceable back to an
individual’s login. The spreadsheet can also automatically tally orders as they are created with a few
simple formulas.  

COMOC has created a Buying Club Formulas Spreadsheet for collating orders which is available for
download from this website. The “Buying Club Formulas Spreadsheet” has no items listed, allowing
you to fill in your own product info into the first five columns. It has numerous formulas entered to allow immediate reporting of unit pricing,
member payments due, order totaling and more. There is also a  “COMOC Order” spreadsheet which is simply the entire
COMOC Availability List info pre-entered into the first five columns. You can use it to paste the items you
want into the Buying Club Formulas spreadsheet, or into any spreadsheet of your liking. Both are downloadable in most common
spreadsheet formats. Learn more about these and how to download them from the Spreadsheets Page, 
http://crownofmainecoop.com/spreadsheets.asp
The foodclub.org website http://www.foodclub.org
offers a free collating and bookkeeping service created by a programmer in a California buying club.

Online Local Food Buying Clubs & Farmers Markets.





COMOC has been distributing Maine organic products throughout New England since 1995. In order to provide the best possible service to your buying club, please read Our Vision which will explain what we believe we can do for you.

 Crown of Maine Cooperative

















Jim Cook started Crown O’Maine Organic Cooperative to distribute local and organic produce from Maine farms to natural food stores, restaurants, buying clubs and institutional kitchens.



Making it Happen in Maine:  Crown O’Maine Takes Distribution to New Levels by Marada Cook Author’s note: While objectivity and honesty are traditionally the foremost goals of journalists, The MOF&G has always made my job easy by asking me to cover farmers and food producers I sincerely admire. “Positively spun and helpful to farmers” has been Jean English’s creed, and in writing a piece about my family’s distribution business, I embrace this philosophy ahead of unbiased reporting. This is my family at work. This story comes from my own kitchen table, and is one I’ve overheard and participated in from teenage years to the present. On Friday afternoons dozens of orders come into the office beside the kitchen at Skylandia Organic Farm in Grand Isle, Maine. “I need a bag of organic whole wheat flour, a case of Nezinscot Farm butter, 50 pounds of ‘Yukon Gold’ potatoes, 10 pounds of mesclun and 15 pounds of fiddleheads.” The Crown O’Maine Organic Cooperative (COMOC) is a specialized distribution business delivering local and organic produce from Maine farms to natural food stores, restaurants, buying clubs and institutional kitchens.  Jim Cook works the end of the phone line: His farm is the northernmost in the cooperative, and it is his job to coordinate filling the truck as it heads southward from Aroostook County. Sometimes an incoming order is for a full pallet-load of potatoes, carrots or wheat flour – other times orders are for a single case of cheese, apples or ployes mix. 






Leah Cook, Crown O’Maine’s trucker, has traveled 24,000 miles delivering produce in Maine in the past year.



 Driving the Crown O’Maine’s 14-foot Ford box truck is Jim’s youngest daughter, Leah. A 23-year-old trucker with a degree in biology from Reed College, she has logged 24,000 miles for COMOC since she began delivering farm products last September. As she says, “I could have crossed the country eight times in as many miles, but I wouldn’t have met all my farmers and produce people and neighbors across the state.”     Leah starts her delivery run at 6 a.m. on Sunday mornings, making pick-ups from Dionne Farm, WoodPrairie Farm, Nature’s Circle Farm, Thibodeau Farm, Margeson Farm, Ostlund Farm, Aurora Mills, Checkerberry Farm, Goranson Farm, Nezinscot Farm and Thirty Acre Farm. Crown O’Maine carries seasonal produce from a full roster of over 25 farms. This week in June, the first stop planned is the home of a fiddlehead picker from Grand Isle. While obstacles to local food distribution are more often system-wide than case-specific, this time the weak link is a missing-in-action producer. “What do you mean, he’s not around this week?” asks Jim Cook, COMOC director. “Well, I think he went on vacation,” explains the picker’s brother over the phone. “Is he coming back?” Jim has sold 150 pounds of fiddleheads, banking on the hope that northern Maine’s cool spring can extend southern Maine’s brief window of picking. Chefs and farmstands have placed heavy orders, knowing this is a one-shot opportunity. Finding fiddleheads in June has never been a sure-fire thing, but neither has distributing produce for small family farms. Over the years fluctuating supply, variable quality and inconsistent seasons have challenged COMOC’s mission to keep farm-gate prices high, wholesale prices reasonable, product available and customers satisfied with quality. These goals leave just enough margin for COMOC’s carefully customized distribution business. COMOC usually sells root vegetables, grains and value-added products in what is considered Maine’s “off-season” (November-June). Last year Crown O’ Maine extended its distribution season with the reemergence of Maine-grown organic oats, wheat flour, spelt and rye flour. The grain harvest in late August got the Crown O’Maine’s “season” off to an early start – and this year the Crown O’ Maine will run straight through the summer months, filling gaps in early spring and summer availability of items such as greens. New farmers participating in the cooperative effort, new products added to the availability list, a refrigerated truck, and a Newport-based warehouse with a 24’ x 30’ walk-in cooler have made the expanded distribution season a working reality. When COMOC began 12 years ago, a 15-passenger Ford Club Wagon loaded with hand-picked, hand-packed, hand-loaded and hand-delivered potatoes was the height of its organizational structure. The cooperative had no by-laws, no official members and no officers – and still doesn’t. The “cooperative” nature of Crown O’ Maine comes from farmers working together to pool product, to maintain uniform quality standards, and to ensure that distribution is on time. The family business is an extension of the abilities of a man who left a comfortable career in dealership car sales to go into farming. The Cook family grew up hearing lines like, “It’s not about price. It’s about quality product.” As the five kids grew older, two (Leah and I) returned to Grand Isle to work the farm and cooperative. Learning from Jim’s experience has been part of the expansion process.  “We have never been the classic ‘middlemen,’” Jim says. “We don’t follow commodity pricing. We don’t speculate on farmers’ produce. We ask, ‘How much do you need at the farm gate to make this work for you?’ In order to pay farms fairly, you must recognize that a ‘good deal’ is not just about price. It is about quality.”  Starting with the family farm (Skylandia Organic Farm in Grand Isle), COMOC established its reputation for niche products and for providing chefs and other markets with unusual organic root vegetables. Believe it or not, in 1995, a widely-available, unblemished, good-eating potato was considered an unusual root vegetable. In recognizing and serving the need, Crown O’Maine was the first and became the largest in-state distributor, and out-of-state exporter, of certified organic produce. Jim’s wife and kids meticulously packed each COMOC box that left Skylandia Farm in the Ford van. Twelve years and 25 additional producers later, carrying uniformly quality products remains a strict standard of the cooperative. It has been successful, moving fingerling potatoes, ‘Sunchoke’ Jeruselum artichokes, spring-dug parsnips, organic cranberries, potatoes in all shapes, sizes and colors, wheat from the “breadbasket of the Northeast,” apples for the coast, blueberries for the west, fiddleheads for anywhere south of Bangor, Maine-made sea salt, Beyond Coffee, farm-made jams, Acadian ployes mix, and greens for the spring-season weather gaps. Foods that were once impossible to find Maine-grown, wild and organic now travel the state every two weeks. Leah Cook’s rounds take her through Hamden, Bar Harbor, Ellsworth, Blue Hill, Belfast, Rockland, Brunswick, Farmington, Skowhegan, Norway, Turner, Augusta, Portland and Portsmouth. They bring her into contact with every facet of the Maine food system. She meets farmers at the warehouse in Newport. She squeezes the delivery truck between liberally-stickered Suburu Outbacks at the Blue Hill Coop. She has encountered an amazing array of personalities, including a farmhand who once caught alligators, and has added her own wry collection of practical tricks to the voices of local food advocates. “Watch out for recycling bins on loading docks,” is one of them. “I get to see all the back rooms of the stores where MOF&G readers shop,” Leah says. “I meet the produce managers who are stalwart defenders of local organic veggies. They know what customers want – and also what they should want. Their staff unpack the boxes like it’s a perpetual birthday party.” These observations are shared with Jim as they go over the next day’s orders: which restaurant gets the largest potatoes; which baker needs his grain in a hurry; where the special order goes; and the final double-check to be sure nothing has been left out. The two routes--one logistical and one physical – create the beaten track to the company’s motto, “Making It Happen in Maine.” On the Crown O’Maine Web site, “It” is defined as “a community inter-connected through a self-providing food system that results in strong and vibrant local agriculture,” but it has taken Jim Cook years to turn this from a personal vision into a viable business. In his experience the concepts of food security, local resilience to national and worldwide issues, and “strengthening of rural communities” that are at once so vital and so nebulous, can be made active and real through a fairly-run food distribution system.   “In this equation every member of this team (farmer-distributor-retailer-consumer) must make enough to cover costs and receive value,” Jim says, “The only time there will be a problem is when the cost/value ratio is wrong. When price exceeds value and it doesn’t sell, then we have a problem.” He says this, and then observes, “In 12 years, I can count on two fingers the number of problems we have encountered.”         Farmers quickly found they can ask the price they need to produce the crop. Purveyors dealing with COMOC found the product unconditionally guaranteed and delivery dates timed to their locations for the freshest possible drop-off. Chefs who value good flavor discovered taste is a Crown O’Maine benchmark of marketability. All parties involved have learned, over years of cooperation, that ‘Maine-grown Organic’ is not limited to this year’s crop. If a certain crop doesn’t exist one year, starting dialog with a farmer may bring it to harvest the next. If a “market” seems to be the obstacle, a phone call to Jim may change the entire picture. Dozens of phone calls as early as seven in the morning, countless emails and faxes, and the week-long process of taking requests and compiling product orders for farmers: This is Jim’s part in “Making It Happen in Maine.” This week, however, “Making ‘It’ Happen” hasn’t happened exactly as planned. On board the delivery truck are greens and frozen strawberries from Skylandia Farm, a freezer and a refrigerator, and a half-ton of fish meal fertilizer for a farmer in Guilford – even after a six-hour delay, though, no fiddleheads have appeared from the St. John River Valley.  Jim shrugs his shoulders as the truck departs. “I’ll have to call everybody tomorrow,” he says, “and apologize.” Two hours later, a call comes in to the farm. “Hello, is Jim there?” He’s here all right. “Did you need some fiddleheads?” It is not the neighbor who disappeared, but an out-of-the-blue call from a second picker.  “Sorry, the truck left hours ago, but stay in touch for next year,” he says, biting his tongue. “Most of the time we take the longer view,” Jim says once he’s off the phone, referring to cost-efficiencies. “The attitude that an endeavor must immediately make money or it can’t be done is short-sighted. The first point is,” he says, repeating himself for emphasis, “The first point is that is has to be done.” No longer biting his tongue, Jim makes a second phone call. “You going towards Boston today?” A muted response comes through. “Got room for four coolers to go to Newport?” Within the hour, Jim has called back the picker, and 150 pounds of fresh fiddleheads are riding south with a tractor-trailer driver from a nearby truck company. “If you admit that the challenges looming ahead are large,” Jim says, “then you must agree that regional food security will be the backbone of our strength as we face these challenges … to be the strongest link in this chain is COMOC’s mission.” For more information about Crown O’Maine Organic Cooperative, please visit www.crownofmainecoop.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
