Native 
    Arkansas Novaculite
Factory Direct: Best Quality & Price 
	on the Internet!





Distributor of the World’s Finest Arkansas Whetstone Sharpening Products

Four hundred million years ago in a small geographical region of Central Arkansas, now part of the Ouachita 
      Mountains, nature began the creation of a sedimentary rock formation composed of microcrystalline quartz called Novaculite. The word Novaculite comes from the Latin word 
      novacula, meaning razor stone. Novaculite is a recrystallized variety of chert. It is the stone material from which whetstone and oilstone sharpeners are made.

 





Novaculite is a type of stone that can only be 
  found in North America and in a limited geographical region of Texas, Oklahoma 
      and Arkansas. The novacula stone formation in 
  the Ouachitas of Central Arkansas is geologically considered, without a doubt, 
  to be the purest and finest quality.  Its extremely high-purity silica 
  content exceeds 99 percent. This Ouachita Mountain Novaculite is the only 
  Novaculite we use in producing the FINEST whetstone sharpeners you can buy.
