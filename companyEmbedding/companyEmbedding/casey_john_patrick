John Patrick Casey's Experience
Title: Lifeguard
               Company: City of Lewisville
Job Details
               The City of Lewisville and the Lewisville Independent School District work in partnership daily to provide a School Resource Officer to all middle school or high school aged children. School Resource Officers or SROs are funded by grants to provide education and prevention on topics such as alcohol and drug abuse, gangs, and conflict resolution. What does a School Resource Officer do? School Resource Officers are specially trained police officers designed to serve as a positive role model for students, and provide assistance to school administration. School Resource Officers are assigned full-time to both high school campuses and one officer is assigned to all three middle schools in the City of Lewisville. The officers provide full police service to their respective campus and build a relationship with students in order to improve relations between youth and police. With all the reported incidents of violence on school campuses, can you guarantee my child's safety while at school where a SRO is present? No police department can fully guarantee the safety of all its citizens. The aim of the School Resource Officer (SRO) program is to help students help themselves through personal safety awareness. In addition, each school campus works with police when developing their school safety plan. The plan includes prevention techniques designed to avoid serious incidents and training for teachers and police on dealing with critical incidents should one occur.

Job Details
               Scott & White is also helping to improve students' ability to get a job later in life by working with Temple High School to develop the Scott & White Health Science Hospital Administration Program. "They have worked with us over the past two years, writing the curriculum," says Dr. Battershell. "We asked Scott & White, 'What career fields do you have trouble hiring in?' because we wanted to better prepare our students for those areas." The Scott & White Health Science Hospital Administration Program allows Temple High School seniors to graduate on a track toward certification as a nurse's assistant (CNA), a certified laboratory assistant (CLA), a pharmacy technician (CPhT), a medical coder (CCA), or a 911 dispatcher.

LEGAL TERMS

(more...)In community property states, property owned and controlled entirely by one spouse in a marriage. At divorce, separate property is not divided under the state's property division laws, but is kept by the spouse who owns it. Separate property includes all property that a spouse obtained before marriage, through inheritance or as a gift. It also includes any property that is traceable to separate property -- for example, cash from the sale of a vintage car owned by one spouse before marriage-and any property that the spouses agree is separate property. Compare community property and equitable distribution.

GIFT TAXESFederal taxes assessed on any gift, or combination of gifts, from one person to another that exceeds $12,000 in one year. Several kinds of gifts are exempt form... (more...)Federal taxes assessed on any gift, or combination of gifts, from one person to another that exceeds $12,000 in one year. Several kinds of gifts are exempt form this tax: gifts to tax-exempt charities, gifts to your spouse (limited to $120,000 annually if the recipient isn't a U.S. citizen) and gifts made for tuition or medical bills. In addition to the annual gift tax exclusion, there is a $1 million cumulative tax exemption for gifts. In other words, you can give away a total of $1 million during your lifetime -- over and above the gifts you give using the annual exclusion -- without paying gift taxes.

PETITION (IMMIGRATION)A formal request for a green card or a specific nonimmigrant (temporary) visa. In many cases, the petition must be filed by someone sponsoring the immigrant, su... (more...)A formal request for a green card or a specific nonimmigrant (temporary) visa. In many cases, the petition must be filed by someone sponsoring the immigrant, such as a family member or employer. After the petition is approved, the immigrant may submit the actual visa or green card application.

STEPCHILDA child born to your spouse before your marriage whom you have not legally adopted. If you adopt the child, he or she is legally treated just like a biological ... (more...)A child born to your spouse before your marriage whom you have not legally adopted. If you adopt the child, he or she is legally treated just like a biological offspring. Under the Uniform Probate Code, followed in some states, a stepchild belongs in the same class as a biological child and will inherit property left 'to my children.' In other states, a stepchild is not treated like a biological child unless he or she can prove that the parental relationship was established when he or she was a minor and that adoption would have occurred but for some legal obstacle.

ANNULMENTA court procedure that dissolves a marriage and treats it as if it never happened. Annulments are rare since the advent of no-fault divorce but may be obtained ... (more...)A court procedure that dissolves a marriage and treats it as if it never happened. Annulments are rare since the advent of no-fault divorce but may be obtained in most states for one of the following reasons: misrepresentation, concealment (for example, of an addiction or criminal record), misunderstanding and refusal to consummate the marriage.

INTERLOCUTORY DECREEA court judgment that is not final until the judge decides other matters in the case or until enough time has passed to see if the interim decision is working. ... (more...)A court judgment that is not final until the judge decides other matters in the case or until enough time has passed to see if the interim decision is working. In the past, interlocutory decrees were most often used in divorces. The terms of the divorce were set out in an interlocutory decree, which would become final only after a waiting period. The purpose of the waiting period was to allow the couple time to reconcile. They rarely did, however, so most states no longer use interlocutory decrees of divorce.

MARRIAGE LICENSEA document that authorizes a couple to get married, usually available from the county clerk's office in the state where the marriage will take place. Couples pa... (more...)A document that authorizes a couple to get married, usually available from the county clerk's office in the state where the marriage will take place. Couples pay a small fee for a marriage license, and must often wait a few days before it is issued. In addition, a few states require a short waiting period--usually not more than a day--between the time the license is issued and the time the marriage may take place. And some states still require blood tests for couples before they will issue a marriage license, though most no longer do.

ISSUEA term generally meaning all your children and their children down through the generations, including grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on. Also called... (more...)A term generally meaning all your children and their children down through the generations, including grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on. Also called 'lineal descendants.'

MEDIAN FAMILY INCOMEAn annual income figure for which there are as many families with incomes below that level as there are above that level. The Census Bureau publishes median fam... (more...)An annual income figure for which there are as many families with incomes below that level as there are above that level. The Census Bureau publishes median family income figures for each state and for different family sizes. A debtor whose current monthly income is higher than the median family income in his or her state must pass the means test in order to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and must commit all disposable income to a five-year repayment plan if filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

SAMPLE LEGAL CASES


In re Estate of Feinberg... 729, 759 NE2d 509, 515 (2001). As early as 1898, our supreme court set forth the general
 rule that testamentary provisions which act as a restraint upon marriage or which encourage
 divorce are void as against public policy. Ransdell v. Boston, 172 Ill. ...
In re Estate of Feinberg... Michele also suggests that a granddaughter who was married to a non-Jewish man at the time
 of Erla's death might subsequently divorce and remarry, this time to a Jewish spouse, and make
 a claim upon the trust. ... Public Policy Regarding Terms Affecting Marriage or Divorce. ...
IN RE MARRIAGE OF TAKATA... THE COURT: I understand your argument and I'm going to look up the case law on it. I understand
 that argument that, you know, Mr. Hafley, if he were to file a divorce action, could get to some
 of that and, therefore, you should be able to get to it. I understand that argument. ...

 A NSW priest is scheduled for a second trial over child-sex charges
 





By a Broken Rites researcher, article updated 16 November 2016
A Catholic priest in northern New South Wales, John Patrick Casey, 68, is scheduled to face a second trial in Sydney's Downing Centre District Court, charged with child-sex offences allegedly committed against three young boys in the 1980s.
John Patrick Casey is a priest of the Lismore diocese, which takes in the NSW north coast from the Queensland border to Camden Haven, south of Port Macquarie. The city of Lismore is where the diocese has its headquarters.
Casey has already faced a trial, which began in the Lismore District Court in July 2016. In that trial he was charged with 27 counts of sexual assault, indecent assault and rape of three boys who were under the age of 16. The incidents allegedly occurred in the 1980s at the priest's house in the Mallanganee parish, west of Casino and Lismore. Casey pleaded not guilty on all charges. On 12 August 2016, Casey, was found not guilty of 16 charges, but the jury could not make a decision on the remaining 11 counts.
Now he is scheduled to face a new trial on 14 charges. The matter has been transferred to Sydney's Downing Centre District Court.
The District Court case number for the Casey matter is 2015/00201591.
Some background
A church website says that Fr John Casey, of the Lismore diocese, was ordained on 2 February 1974. He has ministered in a number of parishes in that diocese.
He has also spent time away from this diocese. A website of the Townsville diocese in north Queensland says that in 1978 Fr John Casey (on loan from the Lismore diocese) was appointed for one year to the parish of Ingham in the Townsville diocese. He returned to the Lismore diocese at the end of 1979.
In the late 1980s, the annual edition of the Australian Catholic Directory listed Fr John Casey as the Parish Priest in charge of the parish of "Our Lady of Perpetual Succour" in Mallanganee (situated to the west of the city of Lismore). Some sculptures by Father John Patrick Casey were placed on display at this parish.
In the 1990s Fr John Patrick Casey was the parish priest at Camden Haven (Laurieton) in the south of the diocese. In the late 1990s, he had a senior role in the diocese, as one of the diocese's four Regional Vicars — he was the Regional Vicar for the diocese's south (the Macleay Region).
After being at Camden Haven (Laurieton) until 2004, Fr John Patrick Casey was appointed to his most recent parish the "Mary Help of Christians" parish at Sawtell, near Coffs Harbour.
As well as working in parishes, John Patrick Casey has also worked as a part-time police chaplain, with duties such as conducting funerals and other religious services for police officers.
The police investigation was conducted by detectives from the NSW Police's Richmond Local Area Command, which has headquarters in Lismore. The detectives were investigating information which had been received by Australia's national child-abuse Royal Commission.

About Us

Since 1993, Broken Rites Australia has been researching the cover-up of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. Too often, the church supported the offending clergy while ignoring the victims. For example, Broken Rites has shown how the church shielded the criminal priest Father Gerald Ridsdale for 32 years without reporting his crimes to the police. Finally, in 1993, some Father Ridsdale victims contacted the police. These victims also contacted the newly-formed Broken Rites.
This photo demonstrates why Broken Rites was needed. In the photo, Catholic priest Gerald Ridsdale (left, in sunglasses and hat) walks to court, accompanied by his support person (Bishop George Pell, then an auxiliary bishop in Melbourne), when Father Ridsdale was pleading guilty to his first batch of criminal charges in May 1993. But no bishop accompanied the victims, who felt deserted by the church leaders. Therefore, since 1993, Broken Rites research has supported many of the Catholic Church's victims, as shown on this website. Read More
