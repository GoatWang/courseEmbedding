Seal N Shield®  Attic Stair Insulator --Our Best Seller--Tens of Thousands Sold!!
The Seal N Shield® Attic Stair Insulator is a zippered green building insulation cover manufactured in 
  the U.S.  The cover has a foam core with radiant barrier on both

  summer.  The cover keeps the heat in your home during the winter.  This deluxe insulation cover seals and 
  insulates your pull down stairs while eliminating potential trip hazards.  
  Its' low profile opening located at the attic entrance virtually eliminates trip hazards. The Seal N Shield® Attic Stair Insulator mounts 
  on the inside of the opening framework. This unique method of 
  installation seals and insulates the entire opening.  This ensures 
  a complete seal around the stairway frame which typically has up to a 
  one inch crack around the stairway frame.  During installation the 
  installer of the stairway has to use spacers around the stairway frame 
  to attach it to the structural framework leaving an opening for air 
  leaks around the sides and ends of the stairway frame.  This unique method of 
  installation eliminates the need for wood decking around the top of the 
  access opening.  The Seal N Shield® Stair  insulated cover is versatile and can be opened to 
  the side or rear to allow unobstructed access to your attic space.  
  Installation is easy and fast.  View our two minute       installation video at the top of this page.

About Progressive Suspension

Ground-up custom? Rebuilding a barn find? Just dialing in your favorite ride? Progressive Suspension has a full line of shocks, cartridge kits, chassis stabilizers, lowering kits, fork springs, and components – including the appropriate pumps, gauges, and tools -- for bikes dating all the way back to the 50's. Progressive systems are lab-engineered and field-tested for ideal performance, and each component is rigorously inspected before it leaves the factory.
New fork springs and cartridges can improve your bike's handling by reducing fork dive, enhancing front end stability, and preventing bottoming out, all while smoothing out the small bumps. And Progressive shocks are preload adjustable, which means custom tunability for individual bike and rider weights. By utilizing varied spacing spring coils, progressive-rate springs become stiffer as they're compressed, resulting in a spring that is supple enough to soak up small bumps, yet firm enough to handle a big hit.
The bottom line is, you don’t know what good suspension is until you’ve ridden on it. Your bike will stop and turn better while keeping the straights nice n’ smooth.





Quick Fact
Choosing the right spring rate will make a big difference in how your bike responds to a Progressive suspension upgrade. With Progressive components, heavy-duty springs are best suited for solo riders over 220lbs. If you ride two-up and/or with a full load of luggage at least 50% of the time, heavy-duty shocks are also recommended.
