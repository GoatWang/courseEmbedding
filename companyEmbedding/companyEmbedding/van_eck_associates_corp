About VanEck[edit]
Founded in 1955, VanEck is a U.S. investment management firm offering mutual funds, exchange-traded products (ETPs), variable insurance portfolios, separately managed accounts, and alternative investments. Its ETPs are marketed under the VanEck Vectors brand. The firm is headquartered in New York City, where its fund managers are located. In addition, it has a network of offices worldwide, including offices in Shanghai (China), Frankfurt (Germany), Madrid (Spain), Pfaeffikon (Switzerland), and Sydney (Australia).[3]
The firm was among the first U.S. money managers to help investors achieve greater diversification through global investing. VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX) was launched in 1968 and was the first U.S. gold fund. Today the firm continues its pioneering tradition by offering innovative, actively managed investment choices in hard assets, emerging markets, precious metals (including gold), fixed income, and other specialized, domestic and international asset classes.[citation needed]
VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) have been offered by VanEck since 2006, when the firm launched the nation’s first gold-mining ETF, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Today VanEck Vectors offers more than 55 ETFs, which span several asset classes, including equity, fixed income, and currency markets. Many of these ETFs are based on pure-play indices whose constituents must derive a majority of revenues from the target region/sector. VanEck Vectors is approximately the 9th largest ETF company as of the end of 2016.[4]
VanEck currently manages assets on behalf of more than 400 institutions, including endowments, foundations, hospitals, pensions, and private banks.

In addition, VanEck offers the VanEck VIP Insurance Funds, a series of investment choices within the variable annuity contracts and variable life policies of widely known and highly regarded insurers.
History[edit]

1955 - John C. van Eck launched one of the first international equity funds that provided a vehicle for U.S. investors to share in the returns of post-war development in Europe and Japan.[5] Forecasting inflationary pressures in the U.S., van Eck established the nation’s first gold fund in 1968.
1980s - The company introduced one of the first global fixed income funds to capitalize on the depreciating dollar.
1993 - VanEck again offered one of the first mutual funds in what was once considered a cutting edge marketplace (Asia).
2006 - The firm launched its VanEck Vectors brand, under which it offers a series of exchange-traded products spanning many asset classes, including equities, fixed income (municipal and international bonds), and currency markets.
2011 - The firm commenced ETF self-indexing with the launch of Market Vectors Index Solutions (renamed MVIS in 2016).
2012 - VanEck expanded its liquid alternatives platform through the acquisition of a hedge fund beta business. VanEck also created a UCITS platform to offer a range of strategies to non-U.S. investors in 2012 and started operations of its VanEck Vectors Australia subsidiary.[6]

Flagship Funds[edit]
With an inception date of 1955, the VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX) was the first gold equity mutual fund made available to U.S. investors and offering exposure to a distinct asset class that is often considered a hedge during times of economic and political uncertainty.[7]

VanEck Hard Assets Fund (GHAAX), launched in 1994, was the first "hard assets" equity fund offering investors exposure to securities of commodity-related companies.
VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), launched in 2006, was the first exchange-traded fund in the U.S. offering broad exposure to the gold mining equity market.[8]
VanEck Vectors Vietnam ETF (VNM), launched in 2009, was one of the first exchange-traded funds in the U.S. offering exposure to locally listed equities in Vietnam.

About VanEck[edit]
Founded in 1955, VanEck is a U.S. investment management firm offering mutual funds, exchange-traded products (ETPs), variable insurance portfolios, separately managed accounts, and alternative investments. Its ETPs are marketed under the VanEck Vectors brand. The firm is headquartered in New York City, where its fund managers are located. In addition, it has a network of offices worldwide, including offices in Shanghai (China), Frankfurt (Germany), Madrid (Spain), Pfaeffikon (Switzerland), and Sydney (Australia).[3]
The firm was among the first U.S. money managers to help investors achieve greater diversification through global investing. VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX) was launched in 1968 and was the first U.S. gold fund. Today the firm continues its pioneering tradition by offering innovative, actively managed investment choices in hard assets, emerging markets, precious metals (including gold), fixed income, and other specialized, domestic and international asset classes.[citation needed]
VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) have been offered by VanEck since 2006, when the firm launched the nation’s first gold-mining ETF, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Today VanEck Vectors offers more than 55 ETFs, which span several asset classes, including equity, fixed income, and currency markets. Many of these ETFs are based on pure-play indices whose constituents must derive a majority of revenues from the target region/sector. VanEck Vectors is approximately the 9th largest ETF company as of the end of 2016.[4]
VanEck currently manages assets on behalf of more than 400 institutions, including endowments, foundations, hospitals, pensions, and private banks. Its traditional and alternative strategies are offered in both fund and separate account portfolios. In addition, VanEck offers the VanEck VIP Insurance Funds, a series of investment choices within the variable annuity contracts and variable life policies of widely known and highly regarded insurers.
History[edit]

1955 - John C. van Eck launched one of the first international equity funds that provided a vehicle for U.S. investors to share in the returns of post-war development in Europe and Japan.[5] Forecasting inflationary pressures in the U.S., van Eck established the nation’s first gold fund in 1968.
1980s - The company introduced one of the first global fixed income funds to capitalize on the depreciating dollar.
1993 - VanEck again offered one of the first mutual funds in what was once considered a cutting edge marketplace (Asia).
2006 - The firm launched its VanEck Vectors brand, under which it offers a series of exchange-traded products spanning many asset classes, including equities, fixed income (municipal and international bonds), and currency markets.
2011 - The firm commenced ETF self-indexing with the launch of Market Vectors Index Solutions (renamed MVIS in 2016).
2012 - VanEck expanded its liquid alternatives platform through the acquisition of a hedge fund beta business. VanEck also created a UCITS platform to offer a range of strategies to non-U.S. investors in 2012 and started operations of its VanEck Vectors Australia subsidiary.[6]

Flagship Funds[edit]
With an inception date of 1955, the VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX) was the first gold equity mutual fund made available to U.S. investors and offering exposure to a distinct asset class that is often considered a hedge during times of economic and political uncertainty.[7]

VanEck Hard Assets Fund (GHAAX), launched in 1994, was the first "hard assets" equity fund offering investors exposure to securities of commodity-related companies.
VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), launched in 2006, was the first exchange-traded fund in the U.S. offering broad exposure to the gold mining equity market.[8]
VanEck Vectors Vietnam ETF (VNM), launched in 2009, was one of the first exchange-traded funds in the U.S. offering exposure to locally listed equities in Vietnam.

About VanEck[edit]
Founded in 1955, VanEck is a U.S. investment management firm offering mutual funds, exchange-traded products (ETPs), variable insurance portfolios, separately managed accounts, and alternative investments. Its ETPs are marketed under the VanEck Vectors brand. The firm is headquartered in New York City, where its fund managers are located. In addition, it has a network of offices worldwide, including offices in Shanghai (China), Frankfurt (Germany), Madrid (Spain), Pfaeffikon (Switzerland), and Sydney (Australia).[3]
The firm was among the first U.S. money managers to help investors achieve greater diversification through global investing. VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX) was launched in 1968 and was the first U.S. gold fund. Today the firm continues its pioneering tradition by offering innovative, actively managed investment choices in hard assets, emerging markets, precious metals (including gold), fixed income, and other specialized, domestic and international asset classes.[citation needed]
VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) have been offered by VanEck since 2006, when the firm launched the nation’s first gold-mining ETF, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Today VanEck Vectors offers more than 55 ETFs, which span several asset classes, including equity, fixed income, and currency markets. Many of these ETFs are based on pure-play indices whose constituents must derive a majority of revenues from the target region/sector. VanEck Vectors is approximately the 9th largest ETF company as of the end of 2016.[4]
VanEck currently manages assets on behalf of more than 400 institutions, including endowments, foundations, hospitals, pensions, and private banks. Its traditional and alternative strategies are offered in both fund and separate account portfolios. In addition, VanEck offers the VanEck VIP Insurance Funds, a series of investment choices within the variable annuity contracts and variable life policies of widely known and highly regarded insurers.
History[edit]

1955 - John C. van Eck launched one of the first international equity funds that provided a vehicle for U.S. investors to share in the returns of post-war development in Europe and Japan.[5] Forecasting inflationary pressures in the U.S., van Eck established the nation’s first gold fund in 1968.
1980s - The company introduced one of the first global fixed income funds to capitalize on the depreciating dollar.
1993 - VanEck again offered one of the first mutual funds in what was once considered a cutting edge marketplace (Asia).
2006 - The firm launched its VanEck Vectors brand, under which it offers a series of exchange-traded products spanning many asset classes, including equities, fixed income (municipal and international bonds), and currency markets.
2011 - The firm commenced ETF self-indexing with the launch of Market Vectors Index Solutions (renamed MVIS in 2016).
2012 - VanEck expanded its liquid alternatives platform through the acquisition of a hedge fund beta business. VanEck also created a UCITS platform to offer a range of strategies to non-U.S. investors in 2012 and started operations of its VanEck Vectors Australia subsidiary.[6]

Flagship Funds[edit]
With an inception date of 1955, the VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX) was the first gold equity mutual fund made available to U.S. investors and offering exposure to a distinct asset class that is often considered a hedge during times of economic and political uncertainty.[7]

VanEck Hard Assets Fund (GHAAX), launched in 1994, was the first "hard assets" equity fund offering investors exposure to securities of commodity-related companies.
VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), launched in 2006, was the first exchange-traded fund in the U.S. offering broad exposure to the gold mining equity market.[8]
VanEck Vectors Vietnam ETF (VNM), launched in 2009, was one of the first exchange-traded funds in the U.S. offering exposure to locally listed equities in Vietnam.

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.65%. The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2017, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.65% other than the following: taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions, expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized.

Offers access to a rules-based index approach to equity investing
Focuses on insider transactions and analyst ratings to determine weightings within the Index
Allocations to sectors within the index can vary significantly from traditional cap-weighted equity benchmark weightings

What are analysts saying about Tetra Tech stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Tetra Tech stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Over the past six months, Tetra Tech’s shares have charted a strong upward trajectory, outperforming the Zacks categorized Pollution Control Equipment and Services industry’s average return. Tetra Tech’s robust financial health, strong backlog levels and diligent capital deployment strategies signal brighter days ahead. The company is enjoying steady top-line growth and improved operating efficiency resulting from cost-management initiatives. Going forward, Tetra Tech remains bullish about its growth across all client sectors. However, softness in the domestic oil and gas segment and general economic conditions may weigh down on the company’s financials, going forward. This apart, the cyclical nature of the key markets served by the company poses a sustained threat to stable growth of the company. Decreased consumer confidence and stringent competition may also add to the company’s woes." (7/10/2017)
2. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "TTEK reported 1Q17 ongoing EPS of $0.49, exceeding our estimate and the consensus of $0.47. Core profitability was in-line with expectations. Highlights of the quarter included 24% organic growth in State and Local, 15% organic growth in core Federal, and record backlog. We anticipate continued strength in these end markets. TTEK shares fell 5%+ (vs a flat S&P 500) following the report and partially recovered Friday with a 3.6% increase (vs a 0.7% increase in the S&P 500). We believe these moves may reflect some skittishness around the prospects of a large Federal Infrastructure bill moving forward in the next year. We are raising our ongoing adjusted EPS estimates slightly to $0.44 (from $0.43) in 2Q17, and $2.16 (from $2.14) for the full year. While we anticipate continued strength in TTEK's core business and see the company as a key beneficiary of potential infrastructure spending, we maintain our Hold rating on concerns that shares will be somewhat range bound until clarity emerges on the Federal government's plans" (2/6/2017)

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $47.50 (1.17% upside)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 15 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.79)Consensus Price Target: $38.87 (9.05% upside)

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

VanEck Highlights
Founded in 1955 by 
            John C. van Eck, Van Eck Associates Corporation was among the first U.S. money managers helping investors achieve greater diversification through global investing. 
            VanEck International Investors Gold Fund was launched in 1968, and was the first U.S. gold fund. Today the firm continues this tradition by offering innovative, actively managed investment choices in hard assets, emerging markets, precious metals including gold, fixed income, and other specialized, domestic and international asset classes.
VanEck's mutual funds are sold nationwide through retail brokers, financial planners and investment advisors. Our Funds are designed for investors seeking innovative choices for portfolio diversification; they are often categorized in asset classes having returns with low correlations to those of more traditional U.S. equity and fixed income investments.
VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) have been offered by VanEck since 2006 when the firm launched the nation's first gold-mining ETF, 
            VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Originally offered under the name "Market Vectors ETFs", on May 1, 2016 we renamed them "VanEck Vectors ETFs" to unite all our offerings under one universal VanEck brand. Today, we offer more than 50 ETFs which span several asset classes, including equity, fixed-income, and currency markets. Many of our ETFs are based on pure-play indices whose constituents must derive a majority of revenues from the target region/sector. VanEck Vectors is one of the largest ETP families in the U.S and worldwide.
VanEck currently manages assets on behalf of more than 400 institutions including endowments, foundations, hospitals, pensions, and private banks. Our traditional and alternative strategies are offered in both fund and separate account portfolios. In addition, we offer the VanEck VIP Insurance Funds, a series of investment choices within the variable annuity contracts and variable life policies of widely known and highly regarded insurers.
