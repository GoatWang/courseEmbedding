It can be difficult for developers to find the motivation to write automated unit tests.  This workshop introduces a simulation that can demonstrate the value of automated unit tests to identify and localize defects.  In the simulation, participants will play the roles of programs and tests.  We will discuss barriers to creating and maintaining unit tests, and how this simulation addresses those barriers.
Theme: Games for Learning, Code and Test
  (We have not published slides for this workshop.  "Slides" link below is to representative slides from other presentations.)

In the simplest of terms, software development decisions for commercial organizations can be reduced to a calculation of whether the cost of developing the software will be outweighed by the estimated revenue generated or costs saved by the software.  However, as Mark Schwartz points out in his book, “The Art of Business Value Paperback” this simple explanation is insufficient for commercial organizations, and not applicable for government and other non-commercial organizations for whom the impact of software isn’t primarily measured in terms of revenue.  
In this session participants will experience a simulation that has been created to explore these question of how to make decisions about investments to deliver mission and business value by examining the impact of these decisions on the performance of organizations in changing environments.

FeatureBan is a simple and quick simulation that introduces several of the key concepts of Kanban, including visualization, feedback loops and limiting work in process and that lets participants learn by doing.  The simulation is also useful because it lets organizations who are curious about Kanban quickly learn about it before investing further.  Mike Burrows invented the simulation, but in this session we will present a modified version that we have used with both technical and non-technical audiences.

In the simplest terms, software development decisions for commercial organizations can be reduced to a calculation of whether the cost of developing the software will be outweighed by the revenue generated or costs saved by the software.
However, what does this mean for government and other non-commercial organizations for whom the impact of software isn’t primarily measured in terms of revenue?  How should organizations prioritize work in the face of conflicting goals and metrics?  Help more people?  Minimize delays?  Prosecute more crimes? Lower costs? In this session participants will experience a dice-based simulation that has been created to explore these questions by examining the impact of these decisions on the performance of organizations in changing environments.

Many organizations are using DevOps to speed the ability of organizations to gain value from the software investments.  Too many organizations attempt to reduce DevOps to just a series of technical tools and practices. Organizations to address organizational and cultural issues in order to effectively bring development and operations groups together.  In this section we will present a play to illustrate how DevOps requires communication and understanding to be successful.

In large Government and Commercial organizations with many interacting systems, architecture is necessary to collaborate effectively across disparate entities and systems. Traditional command and control approaches to architecture are often ineffective and cause great tension, especially when Agile efforts are part of the portfolio. We will discuss two principles, Vision and Partnering.  These principles provide insight and get results for both architects and Agilists; and present tools and approaches on how to effectively engage architects and architecture.

Director Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids, El Mariachi, Sin City) is an Agile Director. He enjoys making highly creative movies quickly and cheaply. His ambition is to make movies at the speed of thought. To achieve this goal, he works in small teams to develop the ideas, visualize them quickly, shoot the movie fast, and build the movie in layers. This workshop will introduce Rodriguez's approach to film making by screening several of his 10 minute flick school featurettes and we will explore how these techniques translate to Agile software development in a lively group discussion.

Description



Pianist David Haney's fourth SLAM CD release, 'Q Sessions', gives an insight into his long standing collaboration with Argentine musicians, in particular Jorge Hernaez. Haney has previously recorded with musicians such as Julian Priester, Andrew Cyrille and Bernard Purdie. 

Haney and Hernaez have worked together regularly since 2002, performing in the USA, Argentina and Chile. Disc One of 'Q Sessions', is a live recording of this duo at the 2015 Buenos Aires International Jazz Festival. On Disc Two, guitarist David Bajda joins the duo in concert in Mendoza. All the material is spontaneously composed. 

He writes: "In 2002, I was invited by jazz photographer, Jorge Lardone to perform in concerts throughout Argentina. He wrote to me that I would not get rich off the tour, but I would be treated very well. Fourteen years have passed and seven trips to Argentina have enriched my life and my artistry. The common thread in all of my trips has been my collaborations with bassist Jorge Hernaez. In 2002, we became friends, and over the years we have honed our love of instant composing into an art form. You don't go to Argentina to get famous, you go there to rescue your soul and to rediscover your passion."

							Description						

A session of energy work with David lasts an hour and generally takes place over Skype, sometimes by phone..
Each session is complete in and of itself, but a group of sessions can also allow for a very deep reworking of your system.
Usually we start with some conversation to see where you’re at. Then we connect with the wider field, invite the help and wisdom of your body/mind system and your off planetary team. That’s when the energy and sounds really begin to flow.
Most people are aware of energies shifting and releasing during a session, even though we may be thousands of miles apart. The sound has a very physical impact. Often emotions are released, and frquently there is a great sense of pressure and weight being freed as ancient, long held patterns give way.
More and more, as we anchor into a new paradigm, we are witnessing the integration of other aspects or dimensions of ourselves. Simply put, our Higher Self is no longer outside of us, it is incarnating, becoming our Inner Self. This happens in waves, with many levels of our multidimensionality coming into form, often for the first time.  
Afterwards, there is a lot of energy in your field. This continues to work and integrate over the coming days. More may be released. Because major recalibrations take place, sometimes with thousands of years of history being released, the field takes a few days to rebalance itself. Drinking pure water, being in nature and rest help the process.
