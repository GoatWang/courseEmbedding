History[edit]
1960s[edit]




Del Taco's headquarters (2013)


The first Del Taco restaurant was opened by Ed Hackbarth and David Jameson in Yermo, California on September 16, 1964 .[1] On the first official day of business, Del Taco made $169.[1] Success of the first restaurant led to two in Barstow, one in Needles, and a fifth restaurant in Corona (the first Del Taco with a drive-through window). Dick Naugle, who installed the kitchen equipment in the Corona store, was impressed by the design and joined Hackbarth and Jameson in the fledgling business. In 1966, the trio founded Red-E-Food Systems, Inc. with the idea of franchising the Del Taco brand.[4] That same year, the original Del Taco sun logo was created and in 1967, Del Taco introduced their famous bean and cheese burrito with green or red sauce to their menu.[1] Before long, the restaurants were being founded throughout Southern California.
1970s[edit]




Del Taco history


Naugle left the company early in the decade to start his own Mexican fast food chain, Naugles. In 1973, the company dropped “Casa” from its name and Red-E-Food Systems became Del Taco, Inc. By that time, the company was enjoying a remarkable growth spurt; during one period, they were opening a new restaurant every month. However, in 1976, Hackbarth and Jameson sold Del Taco to a group of investors. The new owners sold the exclusive rights to use and develop the Del Taco name throughout the United States (excluding California; Eugene, Oregon; and Yuma, Arizona) to W. R. Grace and Company. Grace, primarily a chemicals company, founded a new company, Del Taco Restaurants Inc. of Dallas, Texas, and a new subsidiary, DTG Inc., to oversee the various fast food chains it was acquiring.[4] Nonetheless, the franchise continued to expand. In 1977, there were 50 Del Taco restaurants. A year later in 1978, there were 100.
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Del Taco had roughly 350 restaurants (still located almost exclusively to California).
In February 1989, Del Taco merged their restaurants with the 171 Naugles’ Mexican fast food outlets. Anwar Soliman was the man behind the move and was, ironically, the mastermind behind the purchase of the rights to expand Del Taco throughout the United States back in 1977.[4] With the merger, Del Taco increased in size, and spread as far east as Hickory, North Carolina. The 1980s also brought change in the operation, as Del Taco began to stay open all night long.[1] In Lake Forest, California, where the chain is currently headquartered, there are two Del Tacos directly across the street from each other on Trabuco Road - one of these having formerly been a Naugles.
1990s[edit]




Del Taco's logo from 1992 to 2011


In 1990, Kevin K. Moriarty joined Del Taco as the new CEO, soon becoming the owner of the brand in conjunction with his management team. His team launched new efforts to grow the brand’s image while improving the total customer experience, setting the stage for extreme growth.[1]
In 1992, Del Taco recaptured exclusive rights to its name from W. R. Grace and Company and was now able to expand outside of California.[5] Del Taco launched a $14 million program to redesign its restaurant exteriors, kitchens, and corporate logo. The company presented its Concept 2000 restaurant design and in August 1992 introduced its new logo. In place of the old orange and blue sunset, there was a yellow sun that rose over green mountains against a red background; these colors represented the primary ingredients of Del Taco food: cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. Later that year, executives announced far-reaching plans to expand the chain to 500 stores by 1995 and to add another 225 by 2000. The first new markets it set its sights on were Las Vegas, Nevada; St. Louis, Missouri; and the Northeast Corridor.[4]
Del Taco filed for protection in 1993 under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. In spite of the fact that renovations were made to keep Del Taco profitable, the company continued to pay rent on several unprofitable outlets that had already been closed. They also attempted to negotiate lease reductions on a number of other high cost sites. To make matters worse, Del Taco had been hit with a $3 million lawsuit from a former supplier, which was later settled out of court.[4]
From 1994 through 1998, Del Taco saw their company decrease and eventually increase in size. Though the company signed a deal to open 15 franchise stores in the Northeast with many more in the Southeast, the chain was nowhere near the goals publicized years earlier. In 1995, Del Taco (hurt by the closing of numerous unprofitable units) had only 300 stores, instead of growing to 500 stores. However, the chain began to prosper in 1997, when their total sales had reached an estimated $250 million. By December 1998, Del Taco boasted 325 stores in twelve states and hoped to be debt-free by 2002.[4]
2000s[edit]
By 2000, Del Taco had 372 stores located in ten U.S. states. That year, an important deal was signed with the Compass Group PLC that enabled Del Taco stores to open on American military bases. The first to do business was the store at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in St. Mary's County, Maryland, in early 2001. Other Del Tacos were planned for American bases in Puerto Rico and Naples, Italy.[4]
In early 2001, a group of former Del Taco employees, all of whom were black, brought a discrimination suit against the chain. The group claimed that while working at Del Taco in the Los Angeles area, they had suffered verbal abuse, had been passed over for promotions in favor of Hispanic workers, and were being fired and replaced by illegal immigrants. The case had not been settled.[4]
In an effort to improve its reputation, Del Taco launched a sports-sponsorship program with teams in eight U.S. states, including the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Arizona Coyotes hockey teams, basketball’s Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas’s football and basketball teams, and several minor league hockey and baseball teams.[citation needed] The deal placed the Del Taco logo on signs, drink cups, and special promotional items at the stadiums of the partner teams. It paid off as, in 2003, Del Taco announced that their restaurants had topped $1 million per store in average annual sales, which was remarkable considering that other American stores, notably McDonald’s and Carl’s Jr., featured a decrease in annual sales.[4]
In 2004, a private Nashville, Tennessee based holding named Sagittarius Brands, LLC, which is also the parent company of Captain D's Seafood, purchased Del Taco.
In January 2008, Del Taco announced the opening of its 500th restaurant in Burbank, California.[6] On April 27, 2009, a new Del Taco opened in Oviedo, Florida, marking the first time since the 1980s that Del Taco was available in the Orlando area, this location has been closed since. However there are two other Orlando locations still open.[7]
2010s[edit]




The Del Taco in Denton, Texas, which opened in 2010


Del Taco returned to Texas with a new location in Denton, Texas, north of Dallas. W. R. Grace and Company had previously owned and operated locations in Texas with a licensing agreement in 1978, but sold the restaurants to Taco Bell in 1992.[8]
Guillermo Perales, one of the largest Hispanic restaurateurs in the nation, signed a franchisee agreement in 2011 to open additional locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas.[9]
In March 2012, a location opened in Houston with plans for further expansion in the greater Houston area (but that location went out of business by May 2015),[10] including both Harris County and Montgomery County.[11]
In December 2012, a new Del Taco location opened in Cedar Park, Texas. In 2013, a new location opened in Round Rock, Texas.
In December 2013, Del Taco made its entrance into Oklahoma, opening its first store in Moore, OK, a suburb of Oklahoma City. In the summer of 2014 they opened their second store in Edmond, OK, also a suburb of Oklahoma City.
Del Taco was purchased by Levy Acquisition Corporation and became a public company on June 30, 2015.[12]
Demographics[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2009)


The chain operates in 17 states in the U.S in total, with the majority of their restaurants in the West Coast states (California, Oregon and Washington). Also in 9 other western states (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma,Texas, & Utah).[13] There are also multiple Del Taco restaurants located in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia. There were also stores in Toledo, Ohio, Mishawaka, Indiana, and in Tennessee and Missouri which have all since closed.[citation needed]
Las Vegas, Nevada has the most Del Tacos of any single city,[14] and California has the most Del Tacos of any single state.[15]
Products[edit]
Del Taco serves two different types of food: Mexican and American. Their standard menu includes Hard Shell Tacos, Soft Tacos, Burritos, Quesadillas, Nachos, Deluxe Taco Salad, Crinkle Cut French Fries, Chili Cheddar Fries, Double Del Cheeseburger, Bacon Del Cheeseburger, Triple Del Cheeseburger, Fries, Shakes, and at least four types of Dinner Burritos.[4]
Marketing[edit]
The first mascot of Del Taco was a character of the same name used from 1999 through 2000. While popular, Del Taco (the company) was hit by a lawsuit from Zorro Productions, Inc. and Tristar Pictures, Inc., who claimed that the "Del Taco" character – masked and costumed in black – infringed on their rights to the trademark Zorro figure. Del Taco settled the suit in January 2000, agreeing to make changes to the Del Taco character, but soon discontinued the ad campaign altogether.[4]
In its place, from 2000 through early 2006, Del Taco used Gregg Binkley to play "Dan" in their commercials. Dan, a clumsy marketing spokesman for Del Taco, was famous for his antics during their commercials. Among other things, Dan destroyed cars, broke hockey-rink glass, and mistakenly held a sales event at a nude beach, all while promoting a specific item for Del Taco.[16]
From August 2007 through July 2008, Del Taco featured "The Beast" in their commercials. "The Beast", a personification of hunger, typically stood next to a customer and persuaded him to order a particular item (or particular items) so that they could "Feed the Beast" (which was Del Taco's slogan at the time). "The Beast" made his debut in August 2007 promoting Del Taco's improved Chicken Soft Taco. In addition, he endorsed the Crispy Fish Taco in February 2008, the improved Chicken Quesadilla (with 50% more chicken) in April 2008, and Del's Deal (two half-pound bean and cheese burritos, a regular crunchy taco, and a small drink for $2.99) in June 2008.[17]
Currently, Del Taco uses a variety of commercials to promote their new slogan, "Go Bold or Go Home." The first commercial featured a team of miniature "Mole Men" (a play on "Mole-Men" or "mole people") to promote the Spicy Chicken Mole Soft Taco, which aired in August 2008. Ads included Del Taco's promotion of their improved regular taco in September 2008, the Classic Combo Deal in November 2008, three separate meal deals for under three dollars (including the aforementioned deal) in January 2009, the crispy shrimp taco in February 2009, the chicken soft taco in April 2009, and the chicken fajita burrito in June 2009.[18][19][20][21]

History[edit]
1960s[edit]




Del Taco's headquarters (2013)


The first Del Taco restaurant was opened by Ed Hackbarth and David Jameson in Yermo, California on September 16, 1964 .[1] On the first official day of business, Del Taco made $169.[1] Success of the first restaurant led to two in Barstow, one in Needles, and a fifth restaurant in Corona (the first Del Taco with a drive-through window). Dick Naugle, who installed the kitchen equipment in the Corona store, was impressed by the design and joined Hackbarth and Jameson in the fledgling business. In 1966, the trio founded Red-E-Food Systems, Inc. with the idea of franchising the Del Taco brand.[4] That same year, the original Del Taco sun logo was created and in 1967, Del Taco introduced their famous bean and cheese burrito with green or red sauce to their menu.[1] Before long, the restaurants were being founded throughout Southern California.
1970s[edit]




Del Taco history


Naugle left the company early in the decade to start his own Mexican fast food chain, Naugles. In 1973, the company dropped “Casa” from its name and Red-E-Food Systems became Del Taco, Inc. By that time, the company was enjoying a remarkable growth spurt; during one period, they were opening a new restaurant every month. However, in 1976, Hackbarth and Jameson sold Del Taco to a group of investors. The new owners sold the exclusive rights to use and develop the Del Taco name throughout the United States (excluding California; Eugene, Oregon; and Yuma, Arizona) to W. R. Grace and Company. Grace, primarily a chemicals company, founded a new company, Del Taco Restaurants Inc. of Dallas, Texas, and a new subsidiary, DTG Inc., to oversee the various fast food chains it was acquiring.[4] Nonetheless, the franchise continued to expand. In 1977, there were 50 Del Taco restaurants. A year later in 1978, there were 100.
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Del Taco had roughly 350 restaurants (still located almost exclusively to California).
In February 1989, Del Taco merged their restaurants with the 171 Naugles’ Mexican fast food outlets. Anwar Soliman was the man behind the move and was, ironically, the mastermind behind the purchase of the rights to expand Del Taco throughout the United States back in 1977.[4] With the merger, Del Taco increased in size, and spread as far east as Hickory, North Carolina. The 1980s also brought change in the operation, as Del Taco began to stay open all night long.[1] In Lake Forest, California, where the chain is currently headquartered, there are two Del Tacos directly across the street from each other on Trabuco Road - one of these having formerly been a Naugles.
1990s[edit]




Del Taco's logo from 1992 to 2011


In 1990, Kevin K. Moriarty joined Del Taco as the new CEO, soon becoming the owner of the brand in conjunction with his management team. His team launched new efforts to grow the brand’s image while improving the total customer experience, setting the stage for extreme growth.[1]
In 1992, Del Taco recaptured exclusive rights to its name from W. R. Grace and Company and was now able to expand outside of California.[5] Del Taco launched a $14 million program to redesign its restaurant exteriors, kitchens, and corporate logo. The company presented its Concept 2000 restaurant design and in August 1992 introduced its new logo. In place of the old orange and blue sunset, there was a yellow sun that rose over green mountains against a red background; these colors represented the primary ingredients of Del Taco food: cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. Later that year, executives announced far-reaching plans to expand the chain to 500 stores by 1995 and to add another 225 by 2000. The first new markets it set its sights on were Las Vegas, Nevada; St. Louis, Missouri; and the Northeast Corridor.[4]
Del Taco filed for protection in 1993 under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. In spite of the fact that renovations were made to keep Del Taco profitable, the company continued to pay rent on several unprofitable outlets that had already been closed. They also attempted to negotiate lease reductions on a number of other high cost sites. To make matters worse, Del Taco had been hit with a $3 million lawsuit from a former supplier, which was later settled out of court.[4]
From 1994 through 1998, Del Taco saw their company decrease and eventually increase in size. Though the company signed a deal to open 15 franchise stores in the Northeast with many more in the Southeast, the chain was nowhere near the goals publicized years earlier. In 1995, Del Taco (hurt by the closing of numerous unprofitable units) had only 300 stores, instead of growing to 500 stores. However, the chain began to prosper in 1997, when their total sales had reached an estimated $250 million. By December 1998, Del Taco boasted 325 stores in twelve states and hoped to be debt-free by 2002.[4]
2000s[edit]
By 2000, Del Taco had 372 stores located in ten U.S. states. That year, an important deal was signed with the Compass Group PLC that enabled Del Taco stores to open on American military bases. The first to do business was the store at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in St. Mary's County, Maryland, in early 2001. Other Del Tacos were planned for American bases in Puerto Rico and Naples, Italy.[4]
In early 2001, a group of former Del Taco employees, all of whom were black, brought a discrimination suit against the chain. The group claimed that while working at Del Taco in the Los Angeles area, they had suffered verbal abuse, had been passed over for promotions in favor of Hispanic workers, and were being fired and replaced by illegal immigrants. The case had not been settled.[4]
In an effort to improve its reputation, Del Taco launched a sports-sponsorship program with teams in eight U.S. states, including the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Arizona Coyotes hockey teams, basketball’s Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas’s football and basketball teams, and several minor league hockey and baseball teams.[citation needed] The deal placed the Del Taco logo on signs, drink cups, and special promotional items at the stadiums of the partner teams. It paid off as, in 2003, Del Taco announced that their restaurants had topped $1 million per store in average annual sales, which was remarkable considering that other American stores, notably McDonald’s and Carl’s Jr., featured a decrease in annual sales.[4]
In 2004, a private Nashville, Tennessee based holding named Sagittarius Brands, LLC, which is also the parent company of Captain D's Seafood, purchased Del Taco.
In January 2008, Del Taco announced the opening of its 500th restaurant in Burbank, California.[6] On April 27, 2009, a new Del Taco opened in Oviedo, Florida, marking the first time since the 1980s that Del Taco was available in the Orlando area, this location has been closed since. However there are two other Orlando locations still open.[7]
2010s[edit]




The Del Taco in Denton, Texas, which opened in 2010


Del Taco returned to Texas with a new location in Denton, Texas, north of Dallas. W. R. Grace and Company had previously owned and operated locations in Texas with a licensing agreement in 1978, but sold the restaurants to Taco Bell in 1992.[8]
Guillermo Perales, one of the largest Hispanic restaurateurs in the nation, signed a franchisee agreement in 2011 to open additional locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas.[9]
In March 2012, a location opened in Houston with plans for further expansion in the greater Houston area (but that location went out of business by May 2015),[10] including both Harris County and Montgomery County.[11]
In December 2012, a new Del Taco location opened in Cedar Park, Texas. In 2013, a new location opened in Round Rock, Texas.
In December 2013, Del Taco made its entrance into Oklahoma, opening its first store in Moore, OK, a suburb of Oklahoma City. In the summer of 2014 they opened their second store in Edmond, OK, also a suburb of Oklahoma City.
Del Taco was purchased by Levy Acquisition Corporation and became a public company on June 30, 2015.[12]
Demographics[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2009)


The chain operates in 17 states in the U.S in total, with the majority of their restaurants in the West Coast states (California, Oregon and Washington). Also in 9 other western states (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma,Texas, & Utah).[13] There are also multiple Del Taco restaurants located in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia. There were also stores in Toledo, Ohio, Mishawaka, Indiana, and in Tennessee and Missouri which have all since closed.[citation needed]
Las Vegas, Nevada has the most Del Tacos of any single city,[14] and California has the most Del Tacos of any single state.[15]
Products[edit]
Del Taco serves two different types of food: Mexican and American. Their standard menu includes Hard Shell Tacos, Soft Tacos, Burritos, Quesadillas, Nachos, Deluxe Taco Salad, Crinkle Cut French Fries, Chili Cheddar Fries, Double Del Cheeseburger, Bacon Del Cheeseburger, Triple Del Cheeseburger, Fries, Shakes, and at least four types of Dinner Burritos.[4]
Marketing[edit]
The first mascot of Del Taco was a character of the same name used from 1999 through 2000. While popular, Del Taco (the company) was hit by a lawsuit from Zorro Productions, Inc. and Tristar Pictures, Inc., who claimed that the "Del Taco" character – masked and costumed in black – infringed on their rights to the trademark Zorro figure. Del Taco settled the suit in January 2000, agreeing to make changes to the Del Taco character, but soon discontinued the ad campaign altogether.[4]
In its place, from 2000 through early 2006, Del Taco used Gregg Binkley to play "Dan" in their commercials. Dan, a clumsy marketing spokesman for Del Taco, was famous for his antics during their commercials. Among other things, Dan destroyed cars, broke hockey-rink glass, and mistakenly held a sales event at a nude beach, all while promoting a specific item for Del Taco.[16]
From August 2007 through July 2008, Del Taco featured "The Beast" in their commercials. "The Beast", a personification of hunger, typically stood next to a customer and persuaded him to order a particular item (or particular items) so that they could "Feed the Beast" (which was Del Taco's slogan at the time). "The Beast" made his debut in August 2007 promoting Del Taco's improved Chicken Soft Taco.

History[edit]
1960s[edit]




Del Taco's headquarters (2013)


The first Del Taco restaurant was opened by Ed Hackbarth and David Jameson in Yermo, California on September 16, 1964 .[1] On the first official day of business, Del Taco made $169.[1] Success of the first restaurant led to two in Barstow, one in Needles, and a fifth restaurant in Corona (the first Del Taco with a drive-through window). Dick Naugle, who installed the kitchen equipment in the Corona store, was impressed by the design and joined Hackbarth and Jameson in the fledgling business. In 1966, the trio founded Red-E-Food Systems, Inc. with the idea of franchising the Del Taco brand.[4] That same year, the original Del Taco sun logo was created and in 1967, Del Taco introduced their famous bean and cheese burrito with green or red sauce to their menu.[1] Before long, the restaurants were being founded throughout Southern California.
1970s[edit]




Del Taco history


Naugle left the company early in the decade to start his own Mexican fast food chain, Naugles. In 1973, the company dropped “Casa” from its name and Red-E-Food Systems became Del Taco, Inc. By that time, the company was enjoying a remarkable growth spurt; during one period, they were opening a new restaurant every month. However, in 1976, Hackbarth and Jameson sold Del Taco to a group of investors. The new owners sold the exclusive rights to use and develop the Del Taco name throughout the United States (excluding California; Eugene, Oregon; and Yuma, Arizona) to W. R. Grace and Company. Grace, primarily a chemicals company, founded a new company, Del Taco Restaurants Inc. of Dallas, Texas, and a new subsidiary, DTG Inc., to oversee the various fast food chains it was acquiring.[4] Nonetheless, the franchise continued to expand. In 1977, there were 50 Del Taco restaurants. A year later in 1978, there were 100.
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Del Taco had roughly 350 restaurants (still located almost exclusively to California).
In February 1989, Del Taco merged their restaurants with the 171 Naugles’ Mexican fast food outlets. Anwar Soliman was the man behind the move and was, ironically, the mastermind behind the purchase of the rights to expand Del Taco throughout the United States back in 1977.[4] With the merger, Del Taco increased in size, and spread as far east as Hickory, North Carolina. The 1980s also brought change in the operation, as Del Taco began to stay open all night long.[1] In Lake Forest, California, where the chain is currently headquartered, there are two Del Tacos directly across the street from each other on Trabuco Road - one of these having formerly been a Naugles.
1990s[edit]




Del Taco's logo from 1992 to 2011


In 1990, Kevin K. Moriarty joined Del Taco as the new CEO, soon becoming the owner of the brand in conjunction with his management team. His team launched new efforts to grow the brand’s image while improving the total customer experience, setting the stage for extreme growth.[1]
In 1992, Del Taco recaptured exclusive rights to its name from W. R. Grace and Company and was now able to expand outside of California.[5] Del Taco launched a $14 million program to redesign its restaurant exteriors, kitchens, and corporate logo. The company presented its Concept 2000 restaurant design and in August 1992 introduced its new logo. In place of the old orange and blue sunset, there was a yellow sun that rose over green mountains against a red background; these colors represented the primary ingredients of Del Taco food: cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. Later that year, executives announced far-reaching plans to expand the chain to 500 stores by 1995 and to add another 225 by 2000. The first new markets it set its sights on were Las Vegas, Nevada; St. Louis, Missouri; and the Northeast Corridor.[4]
Del Taco filed for protection in 1993 under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. In spite of the fact that renovations were made to keep Del Taco profitable, the company continued to pay rent on several unprofitable outlets that had already been closed. They also attempted to negotiate lease reductions on a number of other high cost sites. To make matters worse, Del Taco had been hit with a $3 million lawsuit from a former supplier, which was later settled out of court.[4]
From 1994 through 1998, Del Taco saw their company decrease and eventually increase in size. Though the company signed a deal to open 15 franchise stores in the Northeast with many more in the Southeast, the chain was nowhere near the goals publicized years earlier. In 1995, Del Taco (hurt by the closing of numerous unprofitable units) had only 300 stores, instead of growing to 500 stores. However, the chain began to prosper in 1997, when their total sales had reached an estimated $250 million. By December 1998, Del Taco boasted 325 stores in twelve states and hoped to be debt-free by 2002.[4]
2000s[edit]
By 2000, Del Taco had 372 stores located in ten U.S. states. That year, an important deal was signed with the Compass Group PLC that enabled Del Taco stores to open on American military bases. The first to do business was the store at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in St. Mary's County, Maryland, in early 2001. Other Del Tacos were planned for American bases in Puerto Rico and Naples, Italy.[4]
In early 2001, a group of former Del Taco employees, all of whom were black, brought a discrimination suit against the chain. The group claimed that while working at Del Taco in the Los Angeles area, they had suffered verbal abuse, had been passed over for promotions in favor of Hispanic workers, and were being fired and replaced by illegal immigrants. The case had not been settled.[4]
In an effort to improve its reputation, Del Taco launched a sports-sponsorship program with teams in eight U.S. states, including the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Arizona Coyotes hockey teams, basketball’s Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas’s football and basketball teams, and several minor league hockey and baseball teams.[citation needed] The deal placed the Del Taco logo on signs, drink cups, and special promotional items at the stadiums of the partner teams. It paid off as, in 2003, Del Taco announced that their restaurants had topped $1 million per store in average annual sales, which was remarkable considering that other American stores, notably McDonald’s and Carl’s Jr., featured a decrease in annual sales.[4]
In 2004, a private Nashville, Tennessee based holding named Sagittarius Brands, LLC, which is also the parent company of Captain D's Seafood, purchased Del Taco.
In January 2008, Del Taco announced the opening of its 500th restaurant in Burbank, California.[6] On April 27, 2009, a new Del Taco opened in Oviedo, Florida, marking the first time since the 1980s that Del Taco was available in the Orlando area, this location has been closed since. However there are two other Orlando locations still open.[7]
2010s[edit]




The Del Taco in Denton, Texas, which opened in 2010


Del Taco returned to Texas with a new location in Denton, Texas, north of Dallas. W. R. Grace and Company had previously owned and operated locations in Texas with a licensing agreement in 1978, but sold the restaurants to Taco Bell in 1992.[8]
Guillermo Perales, one of the largest Hispanic restaurateurs in the nation, signed a franchisee agreement in 2011 to open additional locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas.[9]
In March 2012, a location opened in Houston with plans for further expansion in the greater Houston area (but that location went out of business by May 2015),[10] including both Harris County and Montgomery County.[11]
In December 2012, a new Del Taco location opened in Cedar Park, Texas. In 2013, a new location opened in Round Rock, Texas.
In December 2013, Del Taco made its entrance into Oklahoma, opening its first store in Moore, OK, a suburb of Oklahoma City. In the summer of 2014 they opened their second store in Edmond, OK, also a suburb of Oklahoma City.
Del Taco was purchased by Levy Acquisition Corporation and became a public company on June 30, 2015.[12]
Demographics[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2009)


The chain operates in 17 states in the U.S in total, with the majority of their restaurants in the West Coast states (California, Oregon and Washington). Also in 9 other western states (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma,Texas, & Utah).[13] There are also multiple Del Taco restaurants located in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia. There were also stores in Toledo, Ohio, Mishawaka, Indiana, and in Tennessee and Missouri which have all since closed.[citation needed]
Las Vegas, Nevada has the most Del Tacos of any single city,[14] and California has the most Del Tacos of any single state.[15]
Products[edit]
Del Taco serves two different types of food: Mexican and American. Their standard menu includes Hard Shell Tacos, Soft Tacos, Burritos, Quesadillas, Nachos, Deluxe Taco Salad, Crinkle Cut French Fries, Chili Cheddar Fries, Double Del Cheeseburger, Bacon Del Cheeseburger, Triple Del Cheeseburger, Fries, Shakes, and at least four types of Dinner Burritos.[4]
Marketing[edit]
The first mascot of Del Taco was a character of the same name used from 1999 through 2000. While popular, Del Taco (the company) was hit by a lawsuit from Zorro Productions, Inc. and Tristar Pictures, Inc., who claimed that the "Del Taco" character – masked and costumed in black – infringed on their rights to the trademark Zorro figure. Del Taco settled the suit in January 2000, agreeing to make changes to the Del Taco character, but soon discontinued the ad campaign altogether.[4]
In its place, from 2000 through early 2006, Del Taco used Gregg Binkley to play "Dan" in their commercials. Dan, a clumsy marketing spokesman for Del Taco, was famous for his antics during their commercials. Among other things, Dan destroyed cars, broke hockey-rink glass, and mistakenly held a sales event at a nude beach, all while promoting a specific item for Del Taco.[16]
From August 2007 through July 2008, Del Taco featured "The Beast" in their commercials. "The Beast", a personification of hunger, typically stood next to a customer and persuaded him to order a particular item (or particular items) so that they could "Feed the Beast" (which was Del Taco's slogan at the time). "The Beast" made his debut in August 2007 promoting Del Taco's improved Chicken Soft Taco. In addition, he endorsed the Crispy Fish Taco in February 2008, the improved Chicken Quesadilla (with 50% more chicken) in April 2008, and Del's Deal (two half-pound bean and cheese burritos, a regular crunchy taco, and a small drink for $2.99) in June 2008.[17]
Currently, Del Taco uses a variety of commercials to promote their new slogan, "Go Bold or Go Home." The first commercial featured a team of miniature "Mole Men" (a play on "Mole-Men" or "mole people") to promote the Spicy Chicken Mole Soft Taco, which aired in August 2008. Ads included Del Taco's promotion of their improved regular taco in September 2008, the Classic Combo Deal in November 2008, three separate meal deals for under three dollars (including the aforementioned deal) in January 2009, the crispy shrimp taco in February 2009, the chicken soft taco in April 2009, and the chicken fajita burrito in June 2009.[18][19][20][21]

History[edit]
1960s[edit]




Del Taco's headquarters (2013)


The first Del Taco restaurant was opened by Ed Hackbarth and David Jameson in Yermo, California on September 16, 1964 .[1] On the first official day of business, Del Taco made $169.[1] Success of the first restaurant led to two in Barstow, one in Needles, and a fifth restaurant in Corona (the first Del Taco with a drive-through window). Dick Naugle, who installed the kitchen equipment in the Corona store, was impressed by the design and joined Hackbarth and Jameson in the fledgling business. In 1966, the trio founded Red-E-Food Systems, Inc. with the idea of franchising the Del Taco brand.[4] That same year, the original Del Taco sun logo was created and in 1967, Del Taco introduced their famous bean and cheese burrito with green or red sauce to their menu.[1] Before long, the restaurants were being founded throughout Southern California.
1970s[edit]




Del Taco history


Naugle left the company early in the decade to start his own Mexican fast food chain, Naugles. In 1973, the company dropped “Casa” from its name and Red-E-Food Systems became Del Taco, Inc. By that time, the company was enjoying a remarkable growth spurt; during one period, they were opening a new restaurant every month. However, in 1976, Hackbarth and Jameson sold Del Taco to a group of investors. The new owners sold the exclusive rights to use and develop the Del Taco name throughout the United States (excluding California; Eugene, Oregon; and Yuma, Arizona) to W. R. Grace and Company. Grace, primarily a chemicals company, founded a new company, Del Taco Restaurants Inc. of Dallas, Texas, and a new subsidiary, DTG Inc., to oversee the various fast food chains it was acquiring.[4] Nonetheless, the franchise continued to expand. In 1977, there were 50 Del Taco restaurants. A year later in 1978, there were 100.
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Del Taco had roughly 350 restaurants (still located almost exclusively to California).
In February 1989, Del Taco merged their restaurants with the 171 Naugles’ Mexican fast food outlets. Anwar Soliman was the man behind the move and was, ironically, the mastermind behind the purchase of the rights to expand Del Taco throughout the United States back in 1977.[4] With the merger, Del Taco increased in size, and spread as far east as Hickory, North Carolina. The 1980s also brought change in the operation, as Del Taco began to stay open all night long.[1] In Lake Forest, California, where the chain is currently headquartered, there are two Del Tacos directly across the street from each other on Trabuco Road - one of these having formerly been a Naugles.
1990s[edit]




Del Taco's logo from 1992 to 2011


In 1990, Kevin K. Moriarty joined Del Taco as the new CEO, soon becoming the owner of the brand in conjunction with his management team. His team launched new efforts to grow the brand’s image while improving the total customer experience, setting the stage for extreme growth.[1]
In 1992, Del Taco recaptured exclusive rights to its name from W. R. Grace and Company and was now able to expand outside of California.[5] Del Taco launched a $14 million program to redesign its restaurant exteriors, kitchens, and corporate logo. The company presented its Concept 2000 restaurant design and in August 1992 introduced its new logo. In place of the old orange and blue sunset, there was a yellow sun that rose over green mountains against a red background; these colors represented the primary ingredients of Del Taco food: cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. Later that year, executives announced far-reaching plans to expand the chain to 500 stores by 1995 and to add another 225 by 2000. The first new markets it set its sights on were Las Vegas, Nevada; St. Louis, Missouri; and the Northeast Corridor.[4]
Del Taco filed for protection in 1993 under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. In spite of the fact that renovations were made to keep Del Taco profitable, the company continued to pay rent on several unprofitable outlets that had already been closed. They also attempted to negotiate lease reductions on a number of other high cost sites. To make matters worse, Del Taco had been hit with a $3 million lawsuit from a former supplier, which was later settled out of court.[4]
From 1994 through 1998, Del Taco saw their company decrease and eventually increase in size. Though the company signed a deal to open 15 franchise stores in the Northeast with many more in the Southeast, the chain was nowhere near the goals publicized years earlier. In 1995, Del Taco (hurt by the closing of numerous unprofitable units) had only 300 stores, instead of growing to 500 stores. However, the chain began to prosper in 1997, when their total sales had reached an estimated $250 million. By December 1998, Del Taco boasted 325 stores in twelve states and hoped to be debt-free by 2002.[4]
2000s[edit]
By 2000, Del Taco had 372 stores located in ten U.S. states. That year, an important deal was signed with the Compass Group PLC that enabled Del Taco stores to open on American military bases. The first to do business was the store at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in St. Mary's County, Maryland, in early 2001. Other Del Tacos were planned for American bases in Puerto Rico and Naples, Italy.[4]
In early 2001, a group of former Del Taco employees, all of whom were black, brought a discrimination suit against the chain. The group claimed that while working at Del Taco in the Los Angeles area, they had suffered verbal abuse, had been passed over for promotions in favor of Hispanic workers, and were being fired and replaced by illegal immigrants. The case had not been settled.[4]
In an effort to improve its reputation, Del Taco launched a sports-sponsorship program with teams in eight U.S. states, including the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Arizona Coyotes hockey teams, basketball’s Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas’s football and basketball teams, and several minor league hockey and baseball teams.[citation needed] The deal placed the Del Taco logo on signs, drink cups, and special promotional items at the stadiums of the partner teams. It paid off as, in 2003, Del Taco announced that their restaurants had topped $1 million per store in average annual sales, which was remarkable considering that other American stores, notably McDonald’s and Carl’s Jr., featured a decrease in annual sales.[4]
In 2004, a private Nashville, Tennessee based holding named Sagittarius Brands, LLC, which is also the parent company of Captain D's Seafood, purchased Del Taco.
In January 2008, Del Taco announced the opening of its 500th restaurant in Burbank, California.[6] On April 27, 2009, a new Del Taco opened in Oviedo, Florida, marking the first time since the 1980s that Del Taco was available in the Orlando area, this location has been closed since. However there are two other Orlando locations still open.[7]
2010s[edit]




The Del Taco in Denton, Texas, which opened in 2010


Del Taco returned to Texas with a new location in Denton, Texas, north of Dallas. W. R. Grace and Company had previously owned and operated locations in Texas with a licensing agreement in 1978, but sold the restaurants to Taco Bell in 1992.[8]
Guillermo Perales, one of the largest Hispanic restaurateurs in the nation, signed a franchisee agreement in 2011 to open additional locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas.[9]
In March 2012, a location opened in Houston with plans for further expansion in the greater Houston area (but that location went out of business by May 2015),[10] including both Harris County and Montgomery County.[11]
In December 2012, a new Del Taco location opened in Cedar Park, Texas. In 2013, a new location opened in Round Rock, Texas.
In December 2013, Del Taco made its entrance into Oklahoma, opening its first store in Moore, OK, a suburb of Oklahoma City. In the summer of 2014 they opened their second store in Edmond, OK, also a suburb of Oklahoma City.
Del Taco was purchased by Levy Acquisition Corporation and became a public company on June 30, 2015.[12]
Demographics[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2009)


The chain operates in 17 states in the U.S in total, with the majority of their restaurants in the West Coast states (California, Oregon and Washington). Also in 9 other western states (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma,Texas, & Utah).[13] There are also multiple Del Taco restaurants located in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia. There were also stores in Toledo, Ohio, Mishawaka, Indiana, and in Tennessee and Missouri which have all since closed.[citation needed]
Las Vegas, Nevada has the most Del Tacos of any single city,[14] and California has the most Del Tacos of any single state.[15]
Products[edit]
Del Taco serves two different types of food: Mexican and American. Their standard menu includes Hard Shell Tacos, Soft Tacos, Burritos, Quesadillas, Nachos, Deluxe Taco Salad, Crinkle Cut French Fries, Chili Cheddar Fries, Double Del Cheeseburger, Bacon Del Cheeseburger, Triple Del Cheeseburger, Fries, Shakes, and at least four types of Dinner Burritos.[4]
Marketing[edit]
The first mascot of Del Taco was a character of the same name used from 1999 through 2000. While popular, Del Taco (the company) was hit by a lawsuit from Zorro Productions, Inc. and Tristar Pictures, Inc., who claimed that the "Del Taco" character – masked and costumed in black – infringed on their rights to the trademark Zorro figure. Del Taco settled the suit in January 2000, agreeing to make changes to the Del Taco character, but soon discontinued the ad campaign altogether.[4]
In its place, from 2000 through early 2006, Del Taco used Gregg Binkley to play "Dan" in their commercials. Dan, a clumsy marketing spokesman for Del Taco, was famous for his antics during their commercials. Among other things, Dan destroyed cars, broke hockey-rink glass, and mistakenly held a sales event at a nude beach, all while promoting a specific item for Del Taco.[16]
From August 2007 through July 2008, Del Taco featured "The Beast" in their commercials. "The Beast", a personification of hunger, typically stood next to a customer and persuaded him to order a particular item (or particular items) so that they could "Feed the Beast" (which was Del Taco's slogan at the time). "The Beast" made his debut in August 2007 promoting Del Taco's improved Chicken Soft Taco. In addition, he endorsed the Crispy Fish Taco in February 2008, the improved Chicken Quesadilla (with 50% more chicken) in April 2008, and Del's Deal (two half-pound bean and cheese burritos, a regular crunchy taco, and a small drink for $2.99) in June 2008.[17]
Currently, Del Taco uses a variety of commercials to promote their new slogan, "Go Bold or Go Home." The first commercial featured a team of miniature "Mole Men" (a play on "Mole-Men" or "mole people") to promote the Spicy Chicken Mole Soft Taco, which aired in August 2008. Ads included Del Taco's promotion of their improved regular taco in September 2008, the Classic Combo Deal in November 2008, three separate meal deals for under three dollars (including the aforementioned deal) in January 2009, the crispy shrimp taco in February 2009, the chicken soft taco in April 2009, and the chicken fajita burrito in June 2009.[18][19][20][21]

In March 2012, a location opened in Houston with plans for further expansion in the greater Houston area (but that location went out of business by May 2015),[10] including both Harris County and Montgomery County.[11]
In December 2012, a new Del Taco location opened in Cedar Park, Texas. In 2013, a new location opened in Round Rock, Texas.
In December 2013, Del Taco made its entrance into Oklahoma, opening its first store in Moore, OK, a suburb of Oklahoma City. In the summer of 2014 they opened their second store in Edmond, OK, also a suburb of Oklahoma City.
Del Taco was purchased by Levy Acquisition Corporation and became a public company on June 30, 2015.[12]
Demographics[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2009)


The chain operates in 17 states in the U.S in total, with the majority of their restaurants in the West Coast states (California, Oregon and Washington). Also in 9 other western states (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma,Texas, & Utah).[13] There are also multiple Del Taco restaurants located in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia. There were also stores in Toledo, Ohio, Mishawaka, Indiana, and in Tennessee and Missouri which have all since closed.[citation needed]
Las Vegas, Nevada has the most Del Tacos of any single city,[14] and California has the most Del Tacos of any single state.[15]
Products[edit]
Del Taco serves two different types of food: Mexican and American. Their standard menu includes Hard Shell Tacos, Soft Tacos, Burritos, Quesadillas, Nachos, Deluxe Taco Salad, Crinkle Cut French Fries, Chili Cheddar Fries, Double Del Cheeseburger, Bacon Del Cheeseburger, Triple Del Cheeseburger, Fries, Shakes, and at least four types of Dinner Burritos.[4]
Marketing[edit]
The first mascot of Del Taco was a character of the same name used from 1999 through 2000. While popular, Del Taco (the company) was hit by a lawsuit from Zorro Productions, Inc. and Tristar Pictures, Inc., who claimed that the "Del Taco" character – masked and costumed in black – infringed on their rights to the trademark Zorro figure. Del Taco settled the suit in January 2000, agreeing to make changes to the Del Taco character, but soon discontinued the ad campaign altogether.[4]
In its place, from 2000 through early 2006, Del Taco used Gregg Binkley to play "Dan" in their commercials. Dan, a clumsy marketing spokesman for Del Taco, was famous for his antics during their commercials. Among other things, Dan destroyed cars, broke hockey-rink glass, and mistakenly held a sales event at a nude beach, all while promoting a specific item for Del Taco.[16]
From August 2007 through July 2008, Del Taco featured "The Beast" in their commercials. "The Beast", a personification of hunger, typically stood next to a customer and persuaded him to order a particular item (or particular items) so that they could "Feed the Beast" (which was Del Taco's slogan at the time). "The Beast" made his debut in August 2007 promoting Del Taco's improved Chicken Soft Taco. In addition, he endorsed the Crispy Fish Taco in February 2008, the improved Chicken Quesadilla (with 50% more chicken) in April 2008, and Del's Deal (two half-pound bean and cheese burritos, a regular crunchy taco, and a small drink for $2.99) in June 2008.[17]
Currently, Del Taco uses a variety of commercials to promote their new slogan, "Go Bold or Go Home." The first commercial featured a team of miniature "Mole Men" (a play on "Mole-Men" or "mole people") to promote the Spicy Chicken Mole Soft Taco, which aired in August 2008. Ads included Del Taco's promotion of their improved regular taco in September 2008, the Classic Combo Deal in November 2008, three separate meal deals for under three dollars (including the aforementioned deal) in January 2009, the crispy shrimp taco in February 2009, the chicken soft taco in April 2009, and the chicken fajita burrito in June 2009.[18][19][20][21]

System-wide and Company-operated comparable restaurant sales growth
      of 7.1% and 6.9%


Raises Fiscal Year 2017 Guidance on Several Key Metrics


Conference call and webcast will be held at 5:00 p.m. ET today

 LAKE FOREST, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. (“Del Taco” or the “Company”), (NASDAQ:TACO),
      the second largest Mexican-American QSR chain by units in the United
      States, operating restaurants under the name Del Taco, today announced
      fiscal second quarter 2017 financial results. The Company also raised
      its guidance for fiscal year 2017 on several key metrics.
    

Fiscal Second Quarter 2017 Highlights



        System-wide comparable restaurant sales growth of 7.1% and
        company-operated comparable restaurant sales growth of 6.9%, marking
        the 15th and 20th consecutive quarter of gains,
        respectively;

        

            Company-operated comparable restaurant sales growth was comprised
            of average check growth of 5.4%, including nearly 3% of menu mix
            growth, and a transaction increase of 1.5%;
          



        Total revenue of $108.6 million, representing 8.6% growth from the
        fiscal second quarter 2016;
      

        Company-operated restaurant sales of $104.0 million, representing 8.4%
        growth from the fiscal second quarter 2016;
      

        Net income increased to $5.3 million, representing diluted earnings
        per share of $0.13, compared to $4.9 million in the fiscal second
        quarter 2016, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.13;
      

        Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased to $17.0
        million from $16.0 million in the fiscal second quarter 2016,
        representing 6.4% growth; and
      

        The opening of two franchise restaurants and one company-operated
        restaurant.
      


John D. Cappasola, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Del
      Taco, commented, “Strong product promotions during the fiscal second
      quarter, including our Jumbo Shrimp limited time offer, the refresh of
      our breakfast menu in March, and dedicated marketing windows for The Del
      Taco and Platos, resulted in outstanding growth in comparable restaurant
      sales. Our enviable track record at company-operated restaurants now
      consists of 20 consecutive quarters of positive comparable restaurant
      sales, with positive transactions in 14 of the past 17 quarters.”
    

      Cappasola continued, “We are pleased to raise key elements of our 2017
      annual guidance on the strength of our Fresh Combined Solutions
      strategy. With the onset of our fiscal third quarter, we began lapping
      our most successful product launch in brand history, The Del Taco, and
      yet our comparable restaurant sales remain strong, trending up double
      digits on a two-year basis through the first 5 weeks of the fiscal third
      quarter. Our playbook for this rollover is driven by our holistic
      combined solutions approach, using a strategic combination of restaurant
      improvements to drive guest experiences and new product news with
      compelling value to drive guest trial and frequency. This includes our
      new Carnitas limited time offer which is driving strong sales mix and
      guest satisfaction.”
    

      Cappasola concluded, “We believe our lineup of new products and
      marketing, along with our continued focus on improving operations, will
      further embed our QSR+ positioning to drive brand momentum as we close
      in on our $1.5 million average unit volume goal and accelerate system
      unit growth.”
    

Review of Fiscal Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results


      Total revenue was $108.6 million, an increase of 8.6% compared to $100.0
      million in the fiscal second quarter 2016. The growth in revenue was
      driven by an 8.4% increase in Company restaurant sales and a 9.1%
      increase in franchise revenue.
    

      Comparable restaurant sales increased 7.1% system-wide for the fiscal
      second quarter 2017, resulting in a 10.4% increase on a two-year basis.
      The Del Taco system has now generated comparable restaurant sales growth
      for 15 consecutive quarters. Company-operated comparable restaurant
      sales increased 6.9%, marking the 20th consecutive quarter of
      comparable restaurant sales growth. Franchise comparable restaurant
      sales increased 7.5%.
    

      Net income was $5.3 million, representing $0.13 per diluted share,
      compared to $4.9 million in the fiscal second quarter 2016, representing
      $0.13 per diluted share.
    

      Restaurant contribution, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 6.9%
      year-over-year to $21.1 million. As a percentage of Company restaurant
      sales, restaurant contribution margin fell approximately 30 basis points
      year-over-year to 20.3%. The decrease in restaurant contribution margin
      was driven by a 40 basis point increase in labor and related expenses
      and a 20 basis point increase in food and paper costs, partially offset
      by improvements in other operating expenses. A reconciliation between
      restaurant contribution and the nearest GAAP financial measure is
      included in the accompanying financial data.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased to $17.0
      million compared to $16.0 million in the previous year’s fiscal second
      quarter, representing 6.4% growth. A reconciliation between adjusted
      EBITDA and the nearest GAAP financial measure is included in the
      accompanying financial data.
    

Restaurant Portfolio


      During the fiscal second quarter 2017, we and our franchise partners
      opened one and two restaurants, respectively. There were also two
      company restaurant closures.
    

      Thus far in the fiscal third quarter 2017, our franchise partners have
      opened two restaurants and there are currently 10 restaurants (one
      franchised and nine company) under construction, all of which are
      expected to open this fiscal year.
    

Repurchase Program for Common Stock and Warrants


      During the fiscal second quarter 2017, we purchased 400,000 warrants
      from PW Acquisitions, LP, a related party, for $3.75 per warrant. At the
      end of the fiscal second quarter approximately $25.3 million remained
      under our $50 million repurchase authorization.
    

Fiscal Year 2017 Guidance


      We are raising key elements of our guidance for fiscal year 2017, which
      is a 52-week period ending January 2, 2018, and reaffirming other
      elements:
    


        System-wide comparable restaurant sales growth of approximately 3.5%
        to 4.5% (previously 2.0% to 4.0%);
      

        Total revenue between $470 million and $476 million (previously $466
        million and $476 million);
      

        Total company-operated restaurant sales between $452 million and $458
        million (previously $448 million and $458 million);
      

        Restaurant contribution margin between 19.8% and 20.3% (reaffirming);
      

        General and administrative expenses of between approximately 8.2% and
        8.4% of total revenue (previously 8.1% and 8.5%);
      

        Effective tax rate of approximately 40.0% (reaffirming);
      

        Diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.52 to $0.55
        (reaffirming);
      

        Adjusted EBITDA between $71.5 million and $73.5 million (previously
        $71.0 million and $73.5 million);
      

        23 to 26 new system-wide restaurant openings (reaffirming); and
      

        Net capital expenditures totaling approximately $43.0 million to $46.0
        million (reaffirming).
      


      We have not reconciled guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding
      GAAP financial measure because we do not provide guidance for the
      various reconciling items. We are unable to provide guidance for these
      reconciling items because we cannot determine their probable
      significance, as certain items are outside of our control and cannot be
      reasonably predicted due to the fact that these items could vary
      significantly from period to period. Accordingly, a reconciliation to
      the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not available without
      unreasonable effort.
    

Conference Call


      A conference call and webcast to discuss Del Taco’s financial results is
      scheduled for 5:00 p.m. ET today. Hosting the conference call and
      webcast will be John D. Cappasola, Jr., President and Chief Executive
      Officer; and Steven L. Brake, Executive Vice President and Chief
      Financial Officer.
    

      Interested parties may listen to the conference call via telephone by
      dialing 1-201-689-8471. A telephone replay will be available shortly
      after the call has concluded and can be accessed by dialing
      1-412-317-6671, the passcode is 13665325.
    

      The webcast will be available at www.deltaco.com
      under the investors section and will be archived on the site shortly
      after the call has concluded.
    

Key Financial Definitions


Comparable restaurant sales growth reflects the change in
      year-over-year sales for the comparable company, franchise and total
      system restaurant base. Restaurants are included in the comparable store
      base in the accounting period following its 18th full month
      of operations and excludes restaurant closures.
    

Restaurant contribution is defined as company restaurant sales
      less restaurant operating expenses, which are food and paper costs,
      labor and related expenses and occupancy and other operating expenses. Restaurant
      contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a
      percentage of company restaurant sales. Restaurant contribution and
      restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor
      presented in accordance with, GAAP. Restaurant contribution and
      restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating
      performance of restaurants and the calculations thereof may not be
      comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution
      and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools,
      and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for
      analysis of results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Management believes
      that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are
      important tools for investors because they are widely-used metrics
      within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level
      productivity, efficiency and performance. Management uses restaurant
      contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key performance
      indicators to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at Del
      Taco restaurants, to evaluate restaurant performance across periods and
      to evaluate restaurant financial performance compared with competitors. A
      reconciliation between restaurant contribution and the nearest GAAP
      financial measure is included in the accompanying financial data.
    

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/loss prior to interest
      expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to
      add back certain charges, such as stock-based compensation expense and
      transaction-related costs, as these expenses are not considered an
      indicator of ongoing company performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a
      non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an
      alternative to operating income or net income/loss as a measure of
      operating performance or cash flows or as measures of liquidity.
      Non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily calculated the same way
      by different companies and should not be considered a substitute for or
      superior to GAAP results. We believe Adjusted EBITDA facilitates
      operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the
      effects of some items that vary from period to period without any
      correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among
      similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by
      variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax
      positions (such as the impact on periods or changes in effective tax
      rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of
      facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We
      also present Adjusted EBITDA because (i) we believe this measure is
      frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested
      parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe investors
      will find this measure useful in assessing our ability to service or
      incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a
      benchmark to compare performance to that of competitors. A
      reconciliation between Adjusted EBITDA and the nearest GAAP financial
      measure is included in the accompanying financial data.
    

About Del Taco Restaurants, Inc.


Del Taco (NASDAQ: TACO) offers a unique variety of both Mexican and
      American favorites such as burritos and fries, prepared fresh in every
      restaurant’s working kitchen with the value and convenience of a drive
      thru. Del Taco’s menu items taste better because they are made with
      quality ingredients like freshly grated cheddar, hand-chopped pico de
      gallo, sliced avocado, slow-cooked beans made from scratch, and
      fresh-grilled marinated chicken and carne asada. The brand’s UnFreshing
      Believable® campaign further communicates Del Taco’s commitment to
      provide guests with the best quality and value for their money. Founded
      in 1964, today Del Taco serves more than three million guests each week
      at its more than 550 restaurants across 15 states. For more information,

Forward-Looking Statements


      In addition to historical information, this release may contain a number
      of “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include,
      without limitation, information concerning Del Taco’s possible or
      assumed future results of operations, business strategies, competitive
      position, industry environment, potential growth opportunities and the
      effects of regulation. These statements are based Del Taco’s
      management’s current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of
      assumptions concerning future events. When used in this press release,
      the words “estimates,” “projected,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
      “forecasts,” “plans,” “intends,” “believes,” “seeks,” “target,” “may,”
      “will,” “should,” “future,” “propose,” “preliminary,” “guidance,” “on
      track” and variations of these words or similar expressions (or the
      negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify
      forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject
      to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other
      important factors, many of which are outside Del Taco’s management’s
      control that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
      results discussed in the forward-looking statements. These risks
      included, without limitation, consumer demand, our inability to
      successfully open company-operated or franchised restaurants or
      establish new markets, competition in our markets, our inability to grow
      and manage growth profitably, adverse changes in food and supply costs,
      our inability to access additional capital, changes in applicable laws
      or regulations, food safety and foodborne illness concerns, our
      inability to manage existing and to obtain additional franchisees, our
      inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, our inability to
      profitably expand into new markets, changes in, or the discontinuation
      of, the Company’s repurchase program, and the possibility that we may be
      adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive
      factors. Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed
      in Del Taco’s reports filed with the SEC, including under Item 1A. Risk
      Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3,
      2017, and available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov
      and the Company’s website at www.deltaco.com.

      forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the
      date of this release or otherwise.
