                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA. (First and last names are required for initial applications.) The First, Middle, Last and Credential(s) fields allow the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon. A field cannot contain all special characters.

Our Beliefs
A little on our candy philosophy








Superior Products & Ingredients

                  First and foremost, we are a family business that is dedicated to manufacturing the highest level product for those with a discriminating taste. Our recipes that we use today are the same ones that we founded our business with over 35 years ago. We have a long business relationship with our suppliers and they continue to provide us with the same high level of product that we have used for many years.
                









Education

                  We are constantly trying to educate ourselves on new methods of production, and are proactive in various trade organizations. We are using state of the art molding techniques that very few people in the world are currently employing.
                











Great Customers

                  We are proud and fortunate to say that we have customers in all 50 states and we take great pride in knowing that our business has grown simply by word of mouth.
                









Our Home Town

                  We are very proud of our city of Havre de Grace and that is evident by looking at the box lid of every box of chocolates that leaves the store. The town’s prominent points are all shown on each box of candy. We also do our very best to aid in the local community with our philanthropic endeavors with donations to the local schools, scholarships, service organizations, church groups, and sports organizations.
                











Home Made Chocolate comes to Havre de Grace!May 1978 - Barry and Jean Bomboy purchased a small storefront with an apartment above and started making chocolates using recipes passed down through the family.
