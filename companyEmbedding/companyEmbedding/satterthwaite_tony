Tony Satterthwaite



















        Vice President, Cummins Inc. • President, Distribution Business 
            








Tony Satterthwaite is the Vice President - Cummins Inc., and President of Cummins' Distribution Business. From 2008 to 2014 he was the President of Cummins Power Generation, overseeing the engineering, manufacturing, sales and maintenance of alternators, engines, generators, power systems and complete power solutions for commercial, industrial, recreational, emergency and residential use.
Under his leadership, the Power Generation business unit engineered the power industry’s only full range of large stationary generator sets to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s current Tier 4 standards as well as the stricter Tier 4 Final requirements effective in 2015. The business has also won major new military contracts, expanded the product footprint and invested in new technologies including fuel cells and hybrid motor-generators.
Separately, Satterthwaite also leads Cummins’ Sales and Marketing Functional Excellence efforts, sponsors the corporate Product Lifecycle Management program and is a diversity trainer for the Company. Prior to his current Power Generation role, Satterthwaite led the Company’s Southeast Asia region, as well as the Power Generation business in Asia-Pacific. He was named Managing Director of Power Generation’s operations in Ramsgate, England in 1999 and promoted to Vice President in 2001. During that time he lived abroad in Singapore and the U.K.
Outside of Cummins, Satterthwaite is a Director of Idex Corporation (NYSE: IEX) and is a member of the University of St. Thomas Opus College of Business Strategic Board of Governors.  He is also engaged in the community, currently serving on the Capital Council of Aeon, a low-income housing provider in the Minneapolis/St. Paul region of Minnesota.
Before joining Cummins in 1988, Tony was a General Field Engineer for Schlumberger. He holds a master’s in business administration from Stanford University and an undergraduate degree in civil engineering from Cornell University. In addition, he is a graduate of the first Cummins Executive Leadership Development program.
