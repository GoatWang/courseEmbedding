The owner, Mr. John Gordon is extremely fair, flexible, honest, and always available. I have always enjoyed my time working with GDP & Mr. Gordon as my experience here has greatly benefited my professional career experience. I have over eight years as a General Manager, having more than 25 employees report to me, and I truly admire Mr. Gordon's leadership abilities.ConsMr. Gordon is very honest--sometimes to a fault. I personally believe that he may trust people with more credit than they deserve because I have witnessed several other employees who have tried taking advantage of him. I have observed those sample employees not being self-motivated, but instead being extremely lazy and dishonest.Advice to ManagementContinue to hold employees to their job description, and continue to lead by example. Mr. Gordon has the greatest integrity that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing, and any employee who is willing to work hard & enjoys working for a wonderful employer, then I would recommend anyone work here!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Gordon Document Products Response Mar 15, 2015 – President, CEO Thank you for your reassurances and validation.

Unlike some of the non professionals that just walk in off the street with a proposal in hand for their one size fits all special of the week, GDP enforces a needs analysis policy to show the customer that we customer tailor a system to their needs. GDP hired a new sales MGR who subscribes to this theory and knows how to sell on the up and up.Good spiffs. The Techs are what keep the customers happy. Great techs, great tech service mgr and great tech field mgr. The techs diagnose the problem right the first time, get the parts needed to fix the problem right the first time, and get the job done quickly. The customers appreciate that. And so does the sales force. The owner's wife caters lunch for late morning/early afternoon demonstrations and that is a hit with customers. Personal touch. The woman is pure class, grace and poise.ConsCompany needs a dedicated IT staff that will work their butts off instead of sitting around and complaining.

                        How to measure & fit your Curtain
                      

Notes on curtain fullness or gathering
Once you have entered your curtain pole or rail width, we will calculate the amount of fabric required for your curtains. Some headings require more fullness or gathering than others so these headings will require more fabric which is reflected in the price of the curtains.
The guide below shows the fullness factor - minimum amount of fullness or gathering used for each curtain heading.
All curtains are made in increments of 1/2 widths
Pencil Pleat 1.75
Pinch Pleat 2.25
Goblet Pleat 2.25
Tab Top 1.5
Eyelet 1.5
For example, for a pole length of 120cm and for pinch pleat heading we would recommend using at least 120cm x 2.25 = 270cm flat width of fabric.
                      If the curtain fabric which you have chosen is 140cm wide then we would recommend using two widths of fabric either one at each side of the window for a pair of curtains or two widths joined together for a single curtain.

How do I measure my windows?

How to measure for your curtains.
Please read the information below to ensure you measure correctly for your curtains. It is worth taking extra care when taking measurements and we advise the use of a metal tape to ensure you measure with accuracy. Please take your measurements in CM only.



Measuring the width
We always advise that you measure the curtain track or pole width, not the window.
If you are fitting a new track or pole this should extend 15cm to 20cm either side of the window. This will allow the curtains to be stacked either side of the window.
Curtain Poles
Measure the length of the pole between the finials (decorative ends).
Curtain Rails
Measure the length of the rail. If you have a rail with an overlap in the centre, measure the length of the rail and add the length of the overlap to this measurement.
Measuring the drop
The length of your curtains will depend on your preference. Typical length measurements are as follows.
A: Full length which is approximately 1.5 to 3cm above floor level.
B: Above radiator typically 1 to 3cm above the radiator.
C: Below the window sill typically around 15cm.
Measure from the top of the track or bottom of the curtain rings for a curtain pole to the desired length of your curtains.
Tab Top & Eyelet Curtains
For Tab Top or eyelet curtains you should take your measurements from the very top of the pole.

                        How to measure & fit your Curtain
                      

Notes on curtain fullness or gathering
Once you have entered your curtain pole or rail width, we will calculate the amount of fabric required for your curtains. Some headings require more fullness or gathering than others so these headings will require more fabric which is reflected in the price of the curtains.
The guide below shows the fullness factor - minimum amount of fullness or gathering used for each curtain heading.
All curtains are made in increments of 1/2 widths
Pencil Pleat 1.75
Pinch Pleat 2.25
Goblet Pleat 2.25
Tab Top 1.5
Eyelet 1.5
For example, for a pole length of 120cm and for pinch pleat heading we would recommend using at least 120cm x 2.25 = 270cm flat width of fabric.
                      If the curtain fabric which you have chosen is 140cm wide then we would recommend using two widths of fabric either one at each side of the window for a pair of curtains or two widths joined together for a single curtain.
