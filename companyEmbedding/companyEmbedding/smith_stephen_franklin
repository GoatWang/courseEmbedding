Effect of merger[edit]
Hyrum Smith, then the CEO of Franklin Quest, expected that the 1997 acquisition would increase market value through the synergistic combination of Covey's 7 Habits book with the Franklin Planner and with its associated training-courses.[citation needed] However, after the merger FranklinCovey's stock price dropped from around $20 per share to a low of under $1 per share in early 2003. As of June 1, 2006, it traded around $7 per share which has increased their purchase rate.[citation needed] From late 2009 to mid-2010 the stock price moved in the range $5.5 to $8.[2]
Store closures[edit]
Franklin Covey selectively closed their stores to the point that they now only have a single retail location in Utah.
Products[edit]
The company markets a variety of book and audio products based on Covey's 7 Habits material, as well as numerous titles by other FranklinCovey consultants. The company also offers two main training courses: one based on The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People; and another based on the original FranklinQuest time management program, now titled Focus.
Additionally, FranklinCovey has launched a line of new training and consulting products focusing on leadership and organizational alignment. Software implementation of the company's planning system is named "PlanPlus for Windows", and an online version is offered under the brand PlanPlus Online."

Worth every penny.A lawyer that is honest, doesn't waste time, and gets the best outcome for his client. He was very to-the-point, an excellent negotiator, and most importantly quick on his feet. John Milazo achieved the results that he anticipated and discussed prior to court. This guy thinks with the precision of a computer program--I say this because he analyzes facts and derives accurate conclusions for problems that are so complicated and multi variate... In Southern terms, he cuts through the bull**** with amazing skill. This is probably one of the smartest guys I've ever met...no lie. And he's down to earth. Thanks!Julia E.

He totally fought for me and my kids during my divorce.Puryear & Newman Morton PllcCamille B. ratedOne of the better attorneys if you're a woman seeking a divorce in Williamson County.  Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Our aspiration is to provide high quality products and services to our customer base of plumbers, gasfitters, builders, specifiers, homemakers and designers.We are now a leading importer of exclusive premium European bathroomware based on their quality, design and function and these are not available through mass merchant outlets.Franklin's has branches and showrooms in the North Island located at Pukekohe (also our Head Office) Khyber Pass in Newmarket, Henderson, Panmure, East Tamaki, Hamilton, Tauranga, Wellington and Nelson in the South Island.Our showrooms are staffed with well-trained consultants who have the experience to work alongside yourself to help select the world's most beautifull bathroomware for your building and renovation projects.We are further supported by three distributors in the North Island. The obvious question is: why use Franklin?What is it that makes Franklin stand out from other suppliers? Why would you choose to deal with us?Franklin's is a completely family owned and operated business with traditional "Kiwi" values. The company was established by Peter Smith and was originally operated out of a small shed in Pukekohe from 1954 when horse hitching rails and dusty streets were the norm.Peter Smith retired at 85 years young in 2013. Stephen his son is now managing the business with over 30 years experience within the plumbing and bathroomware industry.From those early beginnings, Franklin's now encompasses eight branches New Zealand wide with four branches in Auckland and New Zealand largest design showroom studio in Khyber Pass CBD. Franklin's further supports three distributors throughout the North Island. Franklin's sends bathroomware all over New Zealand and our products are also in demand throughout the South Pacific having been specified for many high end projects and homes.There are some people who assume that Franklin's only market high end products for the upper end of the market, but this is simply not so. We can specify bathroomware into any level of specification, from normal everyday homes right through to highrise apartments, luxury hotels and large commercial buildings. What we won’t do is compromise quality for price.Franklin's endeavours to stay at the forefront of new technology, continually sourcing new release products out of Europe and you will find most of our product range is exclusive only to our company here within New Zealand.When you walk through the door of any Franklin's branch or are approached by a member of our sales team, you are deemed to be a VIP customer. After all, it is you, the client that enables us to exist. Customer satisfaction is an extreme priority for Franklins.Franklin's will always endeavour to source the best products and back these up with after sales service and support. We have our own internal in house Plumbers to cover any warranty issues and problems that may occur.We trust that your experience with Franklin's will be a pleasant one.
