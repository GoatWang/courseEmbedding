D.C.-based private equity giant The Carlyle Group (NASDAQ: CG) has raised $2.4 billion to purchase stakes in mid-sized companies.
The Carlyle Equity Opportunity Fund II will focus on equity investments ranging from $20 million to $200 million and serves as a follow-up to a previous fund, the Carlyle Equity Opportunity Fund I, which raised $1.1 billion in 2011 and invested in 15 companies.

The new fund has already made investments in marine transportation company Seacor Holdings Inc. (NYSE: CKH), merchandising solutions firm Array Canada Inc. and in the McLean-based legal tech company LDiscovery LLC.




Rodney Cohen, managing director and co-head of the U.S. middle market investment team, said he was pleased that The Carlyle Group was able to raise more than twice the money than its previous fund. Those funds will help the company capitalize on strong opportunities in the middle market space, he added.
The previous fund invested in companies such as the oil refining company Philadelphia Energy Solutions, ECI Software Solutions, candle-maker and designer Blyth Inc. and cybersecurity firm Coalfire Systems Inc. Over the last 30 years The Carlyle Group has invested $7.3 billion in 91 different transactions in the mid-market buyout space, according to the company.
The company also opened up two new private equity investment funds, according to recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The company declined to comment about the Carlyle Private Equity Access Fund 2015 L.P. and the Carlyle Private Equity Access Blocker Fund 2015 L.P.




 


The new funds are just the latest endeavors at the Carlyle Group, which is looking at new investments in Asia with a $235 million investment fund that closed in December.
The Carlyle Group is coming off an up-and-down 2015, with its stock fluctuating wildly. On May 4, its stock was up to about $32 a share before gradually falling to a close to $15 on Dec. 14. In early 2016, it has fallen even further and now trades around $13.50.
The company posted a sudden loss of $84 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2015, down from a profit of $25 million in the same quarter of the previous year.
The firm has also been the target of investors. New York-based hedge fund Okumus Fund Management Ltd. purchased an 8.8 percent stake in The Carlyle Group, according to SEC filings on Dec. 21.

 Investment Approach
Fund Investments
Positioned to identify and support attractive investment managers globally, AlpInvest professionals are located in New York, Amsterdam, and Hong Kong. All decisions are made by AlpInvest Partners’ independent investment committee, composed of five of the firm’s managing partners plus two of its co-founders. The firm is often solicited to serve as advisors to general partners—both formally and informally.
The Fund Investments team leverages AlpInvest Partners’ firm-wide resources as a meaningful partner to identify trends and opportunities across the full private equity spectrum. With first-hand knowledge collected from the Co-Investments team along with the market visibility of the Secondary Investments team, AlpInvest Partners Fund Investments team is positioned to quickly and efficiently identify trends,
Secondaries
Solutions for Private Equity Investors: As allocations to private equity have grown, investors have sought new ways to manage their exposure to this historically illiquid asset class. AlpInvest Partners’ dedicated Secondary Investments team is highly experienced in this market, acquiring or restructuring portfolios of private equity assets ranging in size from €5 million to more than €1 billion.
Co-Investments
The Co-Investment team seeks to achieve attractive private equity returns through a well-diversified portfolio of co-investments. The team works to maximize the number of pipeline investment opportunities and select the most attractive investments with qualified sponsors. The Co-Investment team has the flexibility to either come in early in a deal process to help underwrite a transaction alongside a sponsor or to participate in a broader co-investment syndication process, and the ability to focus on a broad range of deal types and industries to build a well-diversified portfolio.
We believe that AlpInvest’s strategy is different from the strategy of other Co-Investment managers in several ways:
Dedicated Approach: AlpInvest has one of the largest dedicated and most experienced teams in the Co-Investment market, consisting of 24 individuals with a collective experience of more than 100 years in private equity.
	 
Active and Reliable Underwriting Partner: AlpInvest’s expertise in playing an active role early on alongside sponsors in a deal process is a key differentiator in securing proprietary deal flow and allocations.
	 
Leverage the Scale of AlpInvest’s Funds and Co-Investment Program: AlpInvest is one of the largest and most experienced institutional investors in the global private equity market. The firm’s substantial primary fund investment activities, including the ability to commit significant amounts to a single fund as a limited partner, is of considerable strategic value to sponsors, and can be a significant factor when sourcing Co-Investments. Over the past decade, AlpInvest has formed strong relationships with major private equity sponsors through the firm’s co-investment activities, primary investments, and secondary investments, further enhancing our selection capabilities.
	 
Structured sponsor and Deal Analysis: AlpInvest takes a two tiered approach to the selection and diligence of co-investment opportunities, focusing on both (i) the assessment of the sponsor’s ability to effectively execute and add value and (ii) on the quality of a transaction. The AlpInvest Funds team performs substantial diligence on each sponsor enabling AlpInvest to better assess if a sponsor is positioned to implement the value creation thesis. AlpInvest utilizes a proprietary framework to analyze the strengths of sponsors across multiple dimensions such as geography, industry, deal type and complexity of the value creation thesis. This, coupled with a granular analysis of the opportunity based on extensive due diligence led by our specialized and dedicated AlpInvest Co-Investment team, has led to better informed investment decisions. We believe this detailed approach differentiates AlpInvest in the market.

Preqin Solutions









About Us









Preqin Solutions, formerly Baxon Solutions, is the leading innovator of cloud solutions to the Private Equity industry. We believe that the Private Equity industry deserves better software to help it manage data, and our firm aims to deliver simple functionality to enhance the quality of data and decision making tools available to portfolio companies through to the asset owners. Central to this objective, is the belief that these tools should be accessible to all market participants, and we aim to accommodate all firm sizes through a scalable pricing model and a lightweight solution that doesn’t require significant client resource to manage.
Established in 2005, we have built an extensive in-house team of experienced consultants and financial analysts and accumulated a wealth of client and implementation best practices from our global customer base. We provide a consultative approach to fully assess your business challenges to configure our solution to your needs.
Preqin Solutions is a subsidiary of Preqin Limited, the leading source of information for the alternative assets industry, providing data and analysis via online databases, publications and bespoke data requests. Preqin’s products and services are utilized by more than 47,000 professionals located in over 90 countries for a range of activities including investor relations, fundraising and marketing, and market research. Founded in 2003, the company operates from offices in London, Singapore, New York, Austin, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong and Manila.
Why Preqin Solutions
We are wholly focused on supporting and enhancing the portfolio management process, allowing integration with legacy and best of breed (BOB) systems. Our solution offers consistency and complete transparency in line with private equity directives such as AIFMD and Form PF and private equity industry alliances such as Altexchange and InvestEurope.
Our cloud solution offers significant time savings through automating manual processes and has proven to reduce the entire reporting process by over 45%.
No new hardware, software or IT support is required and the implementation period is 8-12 weeks, by far the fastest in the industry. Most users require less than an hour of training.
We believe that the future relies on an agnostic web interface. It is not a file-based system relying on an Excel add-in. For those who choose to, it can also interface with Excel however.
Finally, through the integration of Preqin data we have the unique ability to contextualize your fund performance relative to public and private markets. More than just the data comes the insight through having access to the expectations of over 10,000 market participants given Preqin’s global presence
