        CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREAs “experience” becomes the key word in today’s entertainment market, traditional businesses are targeting new technology to transform their industries to keep pace with customer taste.Modern Round Entertainment Corp., formerly known as Nuvola, Inc., offers the world’s first visual shooting lounges and is ready to stake its claim in the new market.Each shooting lounge is equipped with a 12x6-foot shooting screen, hit-detection camera, projector, and replica firearms (two non-recoil pistols, two recoil pistols and two recoil rifles). Modern Round provides a visual shooting experience like that of a video game.Guests can choose their skill levels and select from game settings ranging from the old-school shooting range to modern-day “escaping a zombie-ridden city” scenario.Aggressive expansion,k (Photo: ,k)Having opened its first location last July in Peoria, Nevada-based Modern Round is aggressively expanding to multiple markets across the U.S. The company aims to open three new sites this year, according to Modern Round’s 2017 goal, negotiating a new lease for a second location in Las Vegas and evaluating potential sites in Scottsdale, San Antonio, and Houston.Before entering the entertainment industry, Modern Round was engaged in cloud-based technology as well as smart-home products and appliance.The key technology of Modern Round is supported by VirTra, a provider of firearms-training simulators, that provides the company with upgraded video simulations, similar to those used for training for law enforcement and military personnel. This version features wireless replica guns of the look and weight of real guns.Modern Round’s first location in Arizona reported revenues of $5 million during the second half of the last year, with 65 percent coming from food and beverages and the remainder from visual shooting games.Enthusiastic customersTwo guests at Modern Round  socialize at the visual shooting lounge. (Photo: Yu Zhang/Special for The Republic)Modern Round boasts some enthusiastic customers in the Valley of the Sun.Crowdsourcing reviews from Google, Yelp and TripAdvisor rated Modern Round four stars out of five. Its mobile app, which enables its members to make reservations and check events, has been used by 23,000 members, according to the Modern Round Corporation Report released in January.“It was a 'blast!' New experience for me,” Margie Overfield, a massage and bodywork therapist in Phoenix, said, referring to her Christmas party night at Modern Round.Kelly Kordick, of Mesa, also gave high marks to Modern Round.“It was a lot of fun, and I would definitely go back again,” she said.The company has spent close to $3 million on building its first location in Arizona, which is primarily funded by its debt offerings. As the company requires more cash to open future entertainment facilities, it may have to rely on equity or debt investments from non-banking sources, according to its Form 10-K.Seeking fundingModern Round is seeking funding for its expansion. It changed its name from Nuvola, Inc to Modern Round Entertainment Corp. to align to its entertainment concept and double its shares of common stock to 200,000,000, per value $0.001 per share, in the hope of attracting investors to fund the expansion.“I am (a) little skeptical because you can do it if you are playing a regular video game, if you have an Xbox. I think the only difference is that this is a bit more social instead of being at home alone.”Retha Hill, Cronkite New Media Innovation and Entrepreneurship Lab directorThe company was founded by Mitchell Saltz, the former CEO of the giant firearms maker Smith & Wesson. The company’s backing, intrigue and confidence are obvious, but like all new technology, it faces the scrutiny of experts.“I am (a) little skeptical because you can do it if you are playing a regular video game, if you have an Xbox,” said Retha Hill, director of the Cronkite New Media Innovation and Entrepreneurship Lab at Arizona State University. “I think the only difference is that this is a bit more social instead of being at home alone. It’s just like going bowling or watching (a) movie instead of just watching at home.”While visual simulation brings the traditional lounge into a new interactive level, it can be challenged by virtual reality, which immerses guests into a three-dimensional environment. According to market analysis by Digi-Capital, visual reality revenue is projected to hit $120 billion by 2020, mainly driven by the entertainment market, including games and theme parks.Whatever the ultimate competition, Modern Round's growth indicates “experience” is what its customers are looking for in their entertainment.Arizona police to get virtual-reality training on use of force; Tempe company VirTra gets contractThe next evolution in VR storytelling is here

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Purchased this item, very pleased, easy to assemble. I noticed some people did not expect a tv to sit low on the stand. I found a great solution. I ordered from Amazon- Allsop Metal Art 3 Adjustable Micro Leg Adjustments-did the trick-I placed it on the 8 inch setting-worked liked a charm. this way it is even on the top and bottom. Strongly suggest this item. Everyone compliments it.

Purchased this item, very pleased, easy to assemble. I noticed some people did not expect a tv to sit low on the stand. I found a great solution. I ordered from Amazon- Allsop Metal Art 3 Adjustable Micro Leg Adjustments-did the trick-I placed it on the 8 inch setting-worked liked a charm. this way it is even on the top and bottom. Strongly suggest this item. Everyone compliments it.

It was easy to assemble, except there's no holes underneath the shelves to secure them to the frame.

Disappointed 


I have been looking at this  entertainment center for quite some time but just did not have a place to display it in my home. We recently purchased a new home and this particular entertainment center would just be perfect in a certain spot in my home so I ordered it. It came within just a few days.  I didn't open it for several weeks because we had not moved yet. So once we moved my daughter and son-in-law were going to put it together for me it came with absolutely no instructions. It took us forever to figure out how this thing goes together. I called Jenny's twice and asked for instructions because I felt like pieces were missing .  Both times I was told they would email me instructions and mail me a hard copy. To this day I have never received an email or a hard copy of instructions. I'm thankful for my sister-in-law who showed up last weekend and it was her persistence that finally figured out how this thing goes together.   The review that says things did not line up is very true. I also will not send it back because it would be too much of a hassle. But I will be very careful about ordering from here again. I don't usually order from here. Now that it's together I will use it,  The TV does sit way too low to the floor  we thought maybe we could mount a TV to the back bar but that's not looking like it could be something that is possible. So I am very disappointed with the product, and the service I got. It is definitely not Worth $289. It will most likely be the only $289 Ginnys ever get from me. And that's sad because they have a lot of things in their catalog that I really like. But due to the fact that I don't know what I'm getting once I get it I probably won't order from them again.

We are not using this as an entertainment center, but rather as a display for art glass in our gallery. It took the two of us to put it together (4 hands are better than 2) but the instructions were not as bad as some instructions are. It is a bit low to the ground so my husband built an extension piece for the bottom. It works perfectly and many people have commented on it! It is a unique piece for whatever purpose and we love it!

Very Unique Entertainment Center


lI love the entertainment center. I assembled it by myself. It took about 2 days and 2hrs. each day. One of the rods had a blockage and I had to wait until I received a replacement rod before I could complete putting the center together. I put the center on the floor to install the shelves. I
was surprised when the shelves did not have preexisting holes. However, my power screwdriver helped with
that issue. In order to elevate the TV, I purchased a computer riser and that works fine. I love the finished look. (PS. I'm
a 72 yr. old female)

Not All Parts With It


I got my stand today and I was so excited to move out huge heavy one and put this one together, and come to find out not all pieces was there. It is missing the TWO "J" pieces for top and one of the holes was not drilled through the top middle, we had to do it.One lady said TV to low well by the looks of it, Oh man have to sit on the floor to watch TV, now we have to purchase something else for it to sit on top of, just so hubby can watch TV, and play his games. I'm not fully happy as now the packing they came in 2 parts are torn beyond repair and we are stuck with something we cannot finish putting together the way it should be. Also, oh and about those screws that hold the shelves in place there are no pre-drilled holes for those, so mine didn't come fully like it should've been.I'd hate to have to put all those screws in without the holes when I cannot even put nothing back on it because we have to purchase something else to sit it on, before we can do anything with the stand.
