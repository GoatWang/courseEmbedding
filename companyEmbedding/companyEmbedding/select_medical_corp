What Our Job Candidates Are Saying



Each interview was handled extremely professionally, everyone went out of their way to ensure I was comfortable, and I felt welcome and valued throughout the entire process.
EP, Pennsylvania



I am almost sad that my interviewing is over with Select Medical. I have met so many wonderful people, who couldn’t have been more gracious and welcoming. I heard from the Manager of Recruitment today, assuring me that she has my resume close at hand should anything cross her desk that would seem like a good fit. It was so nice of her to take the time to call me and close the loop on my time spent there.
I certainly do hope that I will end up as a member of the Select Medical Team, but regardless, it has been the most pleasurable interview experience I have ever experienced. A group of first class people all the way.Thank you for everything, your time, your warmth, and genuine interest.

History[edit]
Co-founded in 1996 by Rocco Ortenzio and Robert Ortenzio, Select Medical began as a regional provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation. Contract therapy was added to the company's specialized health care offerings in 1997, and was quickly followed by the introduction of long-term acute care in 1998. In 1999, Select Medical made one of its largest acquisitions by purchasing NovaCare Physical Rehabilitation and Occupational Health.
In April 2001, the company completed an initial public offering and was listed on NASDAQ. Fourteen months later, Select Medical was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is currently traded under the NYSE: SEM ticker. In 2004, the company acquired the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, thus formally adding inpatient medical rehabilitation to its patient care offerings. Further growth in this newest care line continued through joint ventures with Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, SSM Health Care - St. Louis and Baylor Health Care System in 2011.
In 2015, Select Medical completed one of its largest acquisition to date when it entered into a joint venture partnership for the purchase of Concentra, a national health care company that delivers a wide range of medical services, including urgent care, occupational medicine and physical therapy.[2]
In 2016, Select Medical divested its Contract Therapy business, Select Medical Rehabilitation Services, to an affiliate of Revelstoke Capital Partners LLC.[3] Select Medical also acquired Physiotherapy Associates, a national provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation care.[4] This acquisition continues to grow Select Medical's portfolio of outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Twenty years later, the Select Medical of today encompasses three areas of expertise: long-term acute care, inpatient medical rehabilitation, and outpatient physical therapy, all of which are delivered and supported by more than 42,000 colleagues across the United States.

History[edit]
Co-founded in 1996 by Rocco Ortenzio and Robert Ortenzio, Select Medical began as a regional provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation. Contract therapy was added to the company's specialized health care offerings in 1997, and was quickly followed by the introduction of long-term acute care in 1998. In 1999, Select Medical made one of its largest acquisitions by purchasing NovaCare Physical Rehabilitation and Occupational Health.
In April 2001, the company completed an initial public offering and was listed on NASDAQ. Fourteen months later, Select Medical was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is currently traded under the NYSE: SEM ticker. In 2004, the company acquired the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, thus formally adding inpatient medical rehabilitation to its patient care offerings. Further growth in this newest care line continued through joint ventures with Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, SSM Health Care - St. Louis and Baylor Health Care System in 2011.
In 2015, Select Medical completed one of its largest acquisition to date when it entered into a joint venture partnership for the purchase of Concentra, a national health care company that delivers a wide range of medical services, including urgent care, occupational medicine and physical therapy.[2]
In 2016, Select Medical divested its Contract Therapy business, Select Medical Rehabilitation Services, to an affiliate of Revelstoke Capital Partners LLC.[3] Select Medical also acquired Physiotherapy Associates, a national provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation care.[4] This acquisition continues to grow Select Medical's portfolio of outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Twenty years later, the Select Medical of today encompasses three areas of expertise: long-term acute care, inpatient medical rehabilitation, and outpatient physical therapy, all of which are delivered and supported by more than 42,000 colleagues across the United States.

History[edit]
Co-founded in 1996 by Rocco Ortenzio and Robert Ortenzio, Select Medical began as a regional provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation. Contract therapy was added to the company's specialized health care offerings in 1997, and was quickly followed by the introduction of long-term acute care in 1998. In 1999, Select Medical made one of its largest acquisitions by purchasing NovaCare Physical Rehabilitation and Occupational Health.
In April 2001, the company completed an initial public offering and was listed on NASDAQ. Fourteen months later, Select Medical was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is currently traded under the NYSE: SEM ticker. In 2004, the company acquired the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, thus formally adding inpatient medical rehabilitation to its patient care offerings. Further growth in this newest care line continued through joint ventures with Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, SSM Health Care - St. Louis and Baylor Health Care System in 2011.
In 2015, Select Medical completed one of its largest acquisition to date when it entered into a joint venture partnership for the purchase of Concentra, a national health care company that delivers a wide range of medical services, including urgent care, occupational medicine and physical therapy.[2]
In 2016, Select Medical divested its Contract Therapy business, Select Medical Rehabilitation Services, to an affiliate of Revelstoke Capital Partners LLC.[3] Select Medical also acquired Physiotherapy Associates, a national provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation care.[4] This acquisition continues to grow Select Medical's portfolio of outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Twenty years later, the Select Medical of today encompasses three areas of expertise: long-term acute care, inpatient medical rehabilitation, and outpatient physical therapy, all of which are delivered and supported by more than 42,000 colleagues across the United States.

History[edit]
Co-founded in 1996 by Rocco Ortenzio and Robert Ortenzio, Select Medical began as a regional provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation. Contract therapy was added to the company's specialized health care offerings in 1997, and was quickly followed by the introduction of long-term acute care in 1998. In 1999, Select Medical made one of its largest acquisitions by purchasing NovaCare Physical Rehabilitation and Occupational Health.
In April 2001, the company completed an initial public offering and was listed on NASDAQ. Fourteen months later, Select Medical was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is currently traded under the NYSE: SEM ticker. In 2004, the company acquired the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, thus formally adding inpatient medical rehabilitation to its patient care offerings. Further growth in this newest care line continued through joint ventures with Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, SSM Health Care - St. Louis and Baylor Health Care System in 2011.
In 2015, Select Medical completed one of its largest acquisition to date when it entered into a joint venture partnership for the purchase of Concentra, a national health care company that delivers a wide range of medical services, including urgent care, occupational medicine and physical therapy.[2]
In 2016, Select Medical divested its Contract Therapy business, Select Medical Rehabilitation Services, to an affiliate of Revelstoke Capital Partners LLC.[3] Select Medical also acquired Physiotherapy Associates, a national provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation care.[4] This acquisition continues to grow Select Medical's portfolio of outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Twenty years later, the Select Medical of today encompasses three areas of expertise: long-term acute care, inpatient medical rehabilitation, and outpatient physical therapy, all of which are delivered and supported by more than 42,000 colleagues across the United States.

History[edit]
Co-founded in 1996 by Rocco Ortenzio and Robert Ortenzio, Select Medical began as a regional provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation. Contract therapy was added to the company's specialized health care offerings in 1997, and was quickly followed by the introduction of long-term acute care in 1998. In 1999, Select Medical made one of its largest acquisitions by purchasing NovaCare Physical Rehabilitation and Occupational Health.
In April 2001, the company completed an initial public offering and was listed on NASDAQ. Fourteen months later, Select Medical was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is currently traded under the NYSE: SEM ticker. In 2004, the company acquired the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, thus formally adding inpatient medical rehabilitation to its patient care offerings. Further growth in this newest care line continued through joint ventures with Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, SSM Health Care - St. Louis and Baylor Health Care System in 2011.
In 2015, Select Medical completed one of its largest acquisition to date when it entered into a joint venture partnership for the purchase of Concentra, a national health care company that delivers a wide range of medical services, including urgent care, occupational medicine and physical therapy.[2]
In 2016, Select Medical divested its Contract Therapy business, Select Medical Rehabilitation Services, to an affiliate of Revelstoke Capital Partners LLC.[3] Select Medical also acquired Physiotherapy Associates, a national provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation care.[4] This acquisition continues to grow Select Medical's portfolio of outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Twenty years later, the Select Medical of today encompasses three areas of expertise: long-term acute care, inpatient medical rehabilitation, and outpatient physical therapy, all of which are delivered and supported by more than 42,000 colleagues across the United States.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
