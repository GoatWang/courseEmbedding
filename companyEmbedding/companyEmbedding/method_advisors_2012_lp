      Symetra Life Insurance Company, a leading fixed annuity provider, has
      introduced two new fixed indexed annuities built for fee-based planning-Symetra
      Advisory Edge and Symetra Advisory Income Edge. Both
      annuities provide retirement customers with asset protection and
      interest crediting opportunities through multiple index options,
      including the JPMorgan ETF Efficiente� 5 Index.
    

      �The addition of Advisory Edge and Advisory Income Edge to Symetra�s
      broad suite of fixed
      indexed annuity products offers advisors greater choice and aligns
      with our commitment to providing transparent, flexible options that add
      value and fit the needs of today�s retirement marketplace,� said Kevin
      Rabin, vice president of Retirement Products. �Symetra�s commitment to
      adapting our products to meet our partners� evolving needs is one of our
      core strengths. Expanding our lineup of commissionable FIAs to include
      these new fee-based products allows advisors and their clients to decide
      which planning model best suits their retirement objectives.�
    

      Advisory Edge and Advisory Income Edge offer:
    


Index Choices-Credited interest based on the performance
        of the ETF Efficiente Index and/or S&P 500� Index, up
        to a cap.
      

Protection of a Fixed Annuity-Purchase payments and
        previously credited interest are protected from market losses.
      


      In addition:
    


Lifetime Income with the Potential to Grow-Advisory
        Income Edge�s guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) provides
        income that can last a lifetime, with upside potential both before and
        after payments begin.

About Symetra


      Symetra Life Insurance Company is a subsidiary of Symetra Financial
      Corporation, a diversified financial services company based in Bellevue,
      Washington. In business since 1957, Symetra provides employee benefits,
      annuities and life insurance through a national network of benefit
      consultants, financial institutions, and independent agents and
      advisors. For more information, visit www.symetra.com.
    

      Symetra Advisory Income Edge and Advisory Edge are individual
      single-premium fixed indexed deferred annuities with a market value
      adjustment feature. Annuities are issued by Symetra Life Insurance
      Company, 777 108th Avenue NE, Suite 1200, Bellevue, WA 98004. Contract
      form number is ICC14-RC1in most states. The Guaranteed Lifetime
      Withdrawal Benefit Rider form number is ICC15-RE1 in most states.
      Product and rider are not available in all U.S. states or any U.S.
      territory. Terms and conditions may vary.
    

      Market value adjustment does not apply in California.
    

      A rider is a provision of the annuity with additional costs, potential
      benefits and features that should never be confused with the annuity
      itself.
    

      Guarantees and benefits are subject to the claims-paying ability of
      Symetra Life Insurance Company.
    

      Symetra Advisory Income Edge and Advisory Edge have fixed and indexed
      accounts. Interest credited to the indexed accounts is affected by the
      value of outside indexes. Values based on the performance of any index
      are not guaranteed. The contract does not directly participate in any
      outside investment.
    

      If the contract is being funded with multiple purchase payments, e.g.
      1035 exchanges, funds will be held and the contract will not be issued
      until all purchase payments have been received. Interest is not credited
      between the dates the purchase payments are received and the date the
      contract is issued.
    

      Except for the JPMorgan ETF Efficiente 5 Index, the performance of an
      index does not reflect the payment or reinvestment of dividends.
    

      It is not possible to invest in an index.
    

      Symetra reserves the right to add or remove any index or indexed
      interest crediting method options. If any index is discontinued or if
      the calculation of any index is changed substantially, Symetra reserves
      the right to substitute a comparable index.
    

      The S&P 500 Index is a product of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (�SPDJI�),
      and has been licensed for use by Symetra Life Insurance Company (SLIC).
      Standard & Poor�s�, S&P� and S&P 500� are registered trademarks of
      Standard & Poor�s Financial Services LLC (�S&P�); Dow Jones� is a
      registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (�Dow Jones�);
      and these trademarks have been licensed for use by SPDJI and its

      Advisory Income Edge and Advisory Edge are not sponsored, endorsed, sold
      or promoted by SPDJI, Dow Jones, S&P, their respective affiliates, and
      none of such parties make any representation regarding the advisability
      of investing in such product(s) nor do they have any liability for any
      errors, omissions, or interruptions of the S&P 500 Index.
    

      The JPMorgan ETF Efficiente� 5 (�JPM ETF Efficiente Index�) has been
      licensed to Symetra Life Insurance Company (the �Licensee�) for the
      Licensee�s benefit. Neither the Licensee nor Symetra Advisory Income
      Edge and Advisory Edge (the �Product�) is sponsored, operated, endorsed,
      recommended, sold or promoted by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (�JPMS�) or
      any of its affiliates (together and individually, �JPMorgan�). JPMorgan
      makes no representation and gives no warranty, express or implied, to
      contract owners in or those otherwise taking exposure to the Product.
      Such persons should seek appropriate professional advice before making
      any investment. The JPM ETF Efficiente Index has been designed and is
      compiled, calculated, maintained and sponsored by JPMS without regard to
      the Licensee, the Product or any contract owner. JPMorgan is under no
      obligation to continue compiling, calculating, maintaining or sponsoring
      the JPM ETF Efficiente Index. JPMorgan may independently issue or
      sponsor other indices or products that are similar to and may compete
      with the JPM ETF Efficiente Index and the Product. JPMorgan may also
      transact in assets referenced in the Index (or in financial instruments
      such as derivatives that reference those assets). These activities could
      have a positive or negative effect on the value of the JPM ETF
      Efficiente Index and the Product.
    

      Interest is credited to indexed accounts using a point-to-point
      crediting method which compares the value of the index at the beginning
      of the one-year interest term to its value at the end of the interest
      term, subject to a cap (maximum). The indexed interest cap is set at the
      beginning of each interest term. If the index performance is positive,
      interest is credited for that term, not to exceed the cap. If the index
      performance is negative, no interest is credited for that term.
    

      The interest for each indexed account option is calculated separately
      and is subject to its own floor and cap. Indexed interest is calculated
      and credited (if applicable) at the end of each annual interest term.
    

      Withdrawals from an indexed account before the end of the term will not
      receive interest for that term.
    

      We will deduct the GLWB Rider Charge for each Interest Term the Rider is
      in effect. Please refer to the contract for more information.
    

      Products and services vary by distributor.

Advisors in the Top 1,000 Financial Advisors have a minimum of seven years of financial services experience, and were selected based on three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor’s returns are dictated largely by the risk tolerance of clients.
