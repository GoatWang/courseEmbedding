DAVIS, SAMUEL S.





DAVIS, SAMUEL S. (1810–1859). Samuel S. Davis, soldier, legislator, and lawman, was born in Lincoln County, Georgia, in 1810. He emigrated to Texas in 1831 with his widowed mother, Mrs. Nancy Davis, and other family members. He served at the battle of Nacogdoches in 1832 and, in the Texas Revolution, served as a private in Capt. John M. Bradley's company from April 30 to July 30, 1836. After the war he settled in San Augustine County, where he was reportedly a "great factor in promoting the general welfare and preserving the order" of the district. Davis was elected to the House of Representatives of the Fourth Congress of the Republic of Texas, where he represented San Augustine from November 11, 1839, until February 5, 1840. In 1843 he was elected sheriff of San Augustine-the second and last from the county during the period of the republic-and was subsequently reelected for several terms. Davis was said to have been an officer in the Mexican War; a Samuel Davis served as a second lieutenant in Company K of Col. George T. Wood's Second Regiment, Texas Mounted Volunteers; since this company was recruited primarily at Milam in neighboring Sabine County, one may reasonably assume him to have been Samuel S. Davis. When Kenneth L. Anderson died in 1845, Davis purchased the Anderson estate on the southeast border of San Augustine County; he resided there for the rest of his life. Davis married Mary T. Price in San Augustine on February 21, 1845. They had four children. A land warrant was issued in October 1854 for Davis's military service. He died in November 1859, and is believed to be buried in the Davis-Sexton family cemetery in San Augustine.
