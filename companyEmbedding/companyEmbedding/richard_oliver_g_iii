Hamilton  May 10, 1999   "Rubin was talking about how to make markets transparent and [about] Russia. It was a little bit over my head," said Oliver G. Richard III, describing, with awe, a recent lunch with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and executives of Exxon, Cargill and Texas Instruments. "And then I realized -- he was talking about our program in Toledo." Richard went on to say that when natural gas competition came to the Ohio town, where Columbia Energy Group owns the gas utility, there was no way for consumers to do comparison shopping until the local newspaper began publishing power rates. "That was the beginning of price transparency for smaller customers," said Richard, chairman of Columbia Energy Group. For Richard, almost everything comes back to the issue that has consumed most of his professional life -- creating competition in the markets for natural gas and electricity. Richard is engaged now in a battle that may determine whether Columbia survives that competition or is acquired as consolidation continues in the $300 billion utility industry. Last month Columbia made an unsolicited takeover bid for Consolidated Natural Gas of Pittsburgh, which had agreed to be acquired by Dominion Resources Inc. of Richmond. Richard is an exuberant chief executive. At 46, he is boyish in appearance, enthusiasm and style. He connects with people easily -- within minutes of a photographer's arrival the two are talking about cameras (Richard was a photographer for the newspaper at Louisiana State University), Loudoun County landmarks, football and baseball. His monthly column in the company's employee magazine is called "Ram Ram Bull-a-Gator," after an Oklahoma high school cheer that his mother taught him. "I am a cheerleader for Columbia," he said. And on a shelf in his office is this message: "A good scout always leaves his campsite in better shape than he found it." But Richard's demeanor should not be mistaken for naivete, said J. Bennett Johnston, a member of Columbia's board of directors and Richard's mentor. "There's not a naive bone in his body. It's almost an `aw shucks' -- it's a winning quality actually," Johnston said. "It's not naivete, it's an openness that is unusual for a person of that status." Johnston was a powerful Democratic senator from Louisiana when he hired Richard from law school in 1978 on the recommendation of an old friend, who described the graduate as the best and the brightest. "Rick shone immediately," Johnston remembered. Richard worked on energy issues as Johnston's legislative assistant. Then, in 1982, he was named a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees gas and electric utilities. At 29, he was the youngest commission member ever. Richard was "the driving force" at FERC in changing a rule that essentially required customers to buy gas from the company that controlled the pipeline that delivered it -- helping to change the role of pipelines to that of common carriers delivering a product available from competing suppliers, said David Cook, former general counsel of FERC. "That was the thing that started to open up markets." From there Richard went on to work as vice president of a gas trading subsidiary for Tenneco Inc., as chief executive of a major pipeline subsidiary of Enron and as chairman and chief executive of New Jersey Resources Corp. Richard took over the Columbia Gas System Inc., as it was known then, in April 1995, as the company was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy. It had filed for protection from its creditors in 1991, when it found itself locked into long-term contracts to pay higher prices for gas than it earned by reselling it. Formerly with headquarters in Wilmington, Del., the company moved to Reston in 1996 and has built a headquarters in Herndon that Richard helped design. Columbia transports most of the natural gas used in the Washington area through its pipelines, and explores for and produces natural gas and sells it to homes and businesses through its utility companies in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Richard "has had a phenomenal run in terms of restoring Columbia to financial health" and improving its stock price performance, said Curt N. Launer, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. Launer noted that Richard has moved "to greater and greater levels of experience with larger and larger companies at each step of his career. Each step on the way has prepared him to be very successful in a combined Columbia-CNG, if there is going to be one." That's not to say there haven't been missteps. In its fourth quarter last year, Columbia lost $6.5 million when one of the company's commodity traders misstated prices on some natural gas futures contracts. The trader was fired, and the company adopted more stringent auditing processes as a result. And Columbia's joint venture with a unit of American Airlines' SABRE Group Inc., which operates American's sophisticated computer reservations system, to design a system on which customers could shop for natural gas has been put on hold. "We were a little ahead of our time," Richard said. Richard grew up around the energy industry in Lake Charles, La. His father worked in plastics research and later in the polyethylene lab at the Cities Service refinery there, and his father-in-law was a member of the Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers Union. In addition, his uncle was an executive vice president of Conoco who was involved in building refineries and in marketing. His mother was a school health nurse. "His whole career has been about the movement from regulation to deregulation, and he understands it to his fingertips," said Daniel Yergin, head of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and the author of "The Prize," a history of the oil industry. "There are few other utility executives who have had the breadth of experience that he has," Yergin said. "He really brings a very broad historical framework to thinking not only about the utility business but about the world. He's very definitely an innovator. . . . He wants to be on the front end of the curve." Now is a heady time to be in the energy business, with an added frisson for executives who don't know whether they will survive the shakeout in the once highly regulated monopoly utility business. Some analysts have said they view its bid for CNG as an attempt by Columbia to avoid becoming a takeover target itself. Richard said he thinks Columbia and CNG are a good fit. "Our cultures are so close," he said. "We have people around the system who live on the same streets." The other benefit -- for investors -- of the proposed merger is that because the two companies are similar, they could save money immediately by eliminating duplicative functions, Richard said. That would allow the new company to "take the cash and reinvest." Richard said that as a boy he played with toy dinosaurs. Gesturing with his hands as if moving pretend reptiles around, he said the smaller dinosaurs sometimes got their licks in against the bigger ones. "Even in the dance of the dinosaurs, some are a little faster." Resume Job: Chairman, president and CEO of Columbia Energy Group Hometown: Lake Charles, La.

  Oliver G. Richard III                Oliver G. Richard III               Columbia Gas System used to be known as an ossified         giant of the regulated natural gas giant industry. Known primarily for         its gas pipelines moving gas from the Gulf of Mexico into the Midwest         as well as regulated distribution subsidiaries in Ohio, Pennsylvania,         Maryland and Virginia, the company once suffered from bad management,         high take-or-pay claims from producers, irate customers who sued the company         for fraud and abuse, and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the wake of         natural gas deregulation.      But investors who pulled up stakes when times         got tough may live to regret it The company is now moving into the forefront         of the energy market-in both natural gas and electricity-thanks to a CEO         who has completely restructured the corporation. Columbia Energy Group         set a record net income in 1997 of $273.3 million, or $4.93 per share,         up $51.7 million from the previous year. Since 1995 Columbia's stock has         gone from low $40 to mid $70 range, all thanks to the company's massive         restructuring.      Oliver G. (Rick) Richard III took the reins         of the battered giant in 1995, brought fresh faces to senior management         (including the first woman to head a major natural gas pipeline company),         moved the company's headquarters from Wilmington, Delaware to the Washington,         D.C. suburb of Herndon, and firmly placed the company on a competitive         track. Richard is well known in the natural gas community, having been         the youngest Commissioner ever appointed to the Federal Energy Regulatory         Commission, as well as serving in senior management positions at Tenngasco,         Enron's Northern Natural Gas Company and New Jersey Resources Corp.      The results of the shake-up have paid off. Thanks         to Richard the company has now moved out of bankruptcy and into the high-tech,         competitive arena. The company recently announced plans to build three         new power plants totaling 1,000 megawatts in Northeast North America,         with Canada as one possible site. The proposal is a 50-50 joint venture         with Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver, British Columbia, and will no         doubt take advantage of Columbia's massive natural gas pipeline and storage         system (now undergoing a massive seven percent expansion to meet increased         marker demand) with Westcoast's experienced constructing and operating         gas-fired power plants, to compete in one of the most competitive emerging         electric markets in North America.      The power generation deal followed on the heels         of another announcement in early January that Columbia Gas System had         changed its name to Columbia Energy Group. "If this were just a name         change we could have issued a press release," said Richard. Although         not the result of a merger or acquisition, the new moniker does reflect         the fundamental changes that he has brought to the company.      "Columbia Energy Group is ready for change,"         said Richard. "Indeed, we intend to accelerate change in the retail         marketplace, because those that adapt, survive. Those that don't, don't."
