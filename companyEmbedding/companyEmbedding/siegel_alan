The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Early life[edit]
Alan Siegel was born to Eugene and Ruth Siegel in New York. He attended Long Beach High School where he played basketball under Robert Gersten. After high school, Siegel attended the Industrial Labor Relations School at Cornell University.[1]
Upon graduating from Cornell, Siegel attended the New York University School of Law, but took a leave of absence in 1962 to accept an Army commission. Siegel trained at Fort Still, Oklahoma and was stationed with the 2nd Howitzer Battalion, 18th Artillery, in Butzbach, Germany.
After he returned from Germany, Siegel decided to leave NYU Law to pursue a career in communications. Throughout the 1960s, Siegel worked at a number of major communications firms, including BBDO, Ruder Finn, and Sandgren & Murtha. During this time he also met his wife, Gloria, with whom he has a daughter.
Siegel+Gale[edit]
In 1969 Siegel and Robert Gale, a designer that Siegel worked with at Sandgren & Murtha, established their own agency, Siegel+Gale. Initially the agency drew in clients that were mostly interested in developing their visual identities. In 1974 Robert Gale sold his part of the agency. Over the years, Siegel+Gale grew from a logo and design focused company to pioneering the development of corporate voice and simplification. The firm's notable clients have included Dell, MasterCard, the NBA, Caterpillar, 3M, Xerox, American Express and The New School.
Throughout the 1970s, Siegel was the leading voice in the plain English movement that proposed simplifying complex financial and legal documents. In 1979, the Internal Revenue Service hired Siegel to transform existing tax forms, resulting in the 1040-EZ form. Siegel also worked on simplifying bank contracts and Census Bureau forms.[2] Siegel's advocacy for simplicity has landed him on the Today show, The McNeil-Lehrer Report, CNN, CBS News, ABC News and in People magazine.
Siegel served as an associate professor of law at Fordham University School of Law, where he designed and taught a legal writing course. He also served as an adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he helped found the Communications Design Center.
In 2012, Siegel retired from Siegel+Gale and assumed the title of Chairman Emeritus.[2]
Siegelvision[edit]
After leaving Siegel+Gale, Siegel founded Siegelvision, a brand identity consultancy that focuses on non-profits, educational organizations, and foundations.[3]
Siegelvision's clients include New York University, National Public Radio, Cornell's College of Engineering, the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, the Legal Aid Society, the Lupus Foundation of America, the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, and Phoenix House.
Other activities[edit]
Siegel remains active in the community and serves on numerous boards and cultural organizations, including the American Theatre Wing, where he is a Tony Award voter.[4]
He also continues to be a champion for simplicity and clarity[permanent dead link], frequently appearing at events and in the media. He spoke about simplifying legal jargon at TED 2010, where in closing he stated, "There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate. There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. So, how are we going to change the world? Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority."[5]
Siegel is a regularly featured columnist in The Huffington Post where he writes about simplicity as it pertains to current events and business trends. Alan has also written for The Wall Street Journal, including guides such as: The Wall Street Journal Guide to Money and Markets, Writing Contracts in Plain English and Simplified Consumer Credit Forms. Siegel also authored One Man's Eye: Photographs from the Alan Siegel Collection and Step Right This Way: The Photography of Edward J. Kelty.
He co-authored the 2013 Simple: Conquering the Crisis of Complexity a book on the power of simplicity in business and government, with Irene Etzkorn, Siegelvision's Chief Clarity Officer.[6] Simple was named one of the best business books of 2013, and the best marketing book of the year, by Strategy+Business magazine.[7]

                              Polarity Therapy. Each of us has a healing power. We can heal ourselves, our relationships and our environment. The key lies
                                 in understanding the very nature of life itself-ENERGY. Polarity Therapy is the science of stimulating and balancing the body's
                                 life energy. When we are in a stateof dis-ease or are out of balance, the flow of life energy becomes obstructed. In this
                                 heavily illustrated book you will find a complete and practical guide, to releasing blocked energy through polarity energy
                                 balancing, nutrition, polarity yoga and developing positive thoughts and attitudes

                              We also provide a new method to overcome limitations imposed by corrupting effects of experimental noise (e.g., high false
                                 positive and false negative rates) in Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) networks, which often provide primary data for protein complexes.
                                 Our new combinatorial algorithm measures connectivity between proteins in Y2H network not by edges but by edge-disjoint paths,
                                 which reflects pathway evolution better within single species network. This algorithm has been shown to be robust against
                                 increasing false positives and false negatives, as estimated using variation of information and separation measures

                              The conventional way of using an application is to install the application first, then start using documents of the application.
                                 The object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm suggests that this order should be reversed: the data should lead to the code.
                                 However, almost all software fails to meet this model of design at the persistence level. While modern software often use
                                 OOP at the program level, the underlying operating systems do not support OOP at the document/file level. OOP languages use
                                 pointers to methods to indicate what operations can be performed on the objects. We extend the idea to include "pointers to
                                 applications". Each document has an attached application pointer, which is read by RADIUS when the document is opened. This
                                 application pointer is then used to locate and deliver the application module necessary for the document
