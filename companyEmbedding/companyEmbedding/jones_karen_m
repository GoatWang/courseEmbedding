Lazy Nezumi Pro 


July 10, 2017July 10, 20171 Comment 

I’d like to plug a Photoshop plug-in that I discovered a couple months ago and I think it’s absolutely wonderful.  Lazy Nezumi Pro.  What it primarily does is smooth your strokes for you, which eliminates the regrettable stair-step pixelated lines you sometimes get if you’re zoomed out too far when you draw or when your processor is being stupid.  And it smooths out your wobbly curves.  It lets you specify how much you want it to average out your strokes, so it’s totally adjustable for your preferences.  
Another totally useful things it does is that it has a ton of different types of on-screen rulers to help you draw lines, curves, shapes in perspective, spirals, etc.  The great thing about these rulers is that you can adjust the precision.  So, when you want to draw almost-perfect shapes or lines, but not so perfect that it doesn’t look hand-drawn, this does that beautifully.  
There are a bunch of other cool features as well that you absolutely should play with.  
I bought it because my wonderful wacom cintiq had ANOTHER 3-in-1 cord fail on me.  Seriously, wacom?  Seriously?!?  And it took TWO MONTHS for them to send me a replacement because they were out of stock.  (If you have one of these, do yourself a favor and buy a spare cord to keep around, because they break ALL THE TIME and wacom can’t seem to keep them in stock.  Especially if you’re out of the warranty period.)  
So, my cintiq was out of commission for the entire second half of my recent Genie Loophole project.  Luckily, I still had my old wacom intuos pro. It is a graphics tablet, but not a screen tablet like the cintiq.  It takes a little longer to get the lines the way I like them on the intuos than on the cintiq.  The two main problems are getting strokes to fall exactly where I want them and avoiding the stair-step thing on my lines.  
Lazy Nezumi saved my skin.  After some practice, I was able to use that in combination with my intuos and get results as good as, and almost as fast as, with my cintiq.  
Anyway, go buy the thing.  It’s worth the money.  You will thank me for it.

I post those pieces because my followers have told me that they appreciate seeing behind-the-scenes mid-process samples. However, that does mean that this blog doesn't always represent my best work.

Description



This exciting series of resources gives youth in grades 7–12 the skills necessary to live an effective Christian life. Instead of just talking to students about how they should live, Vital Skills shows them by blending simple instruction with real-life experience on a variety of timely topics.
Although it's designed as a comprehensive stand-alone series, this discipleship series is a terrific follow-up for those who have used the Vital Truth series. Youth ministers and leaders will be thrilled with this series because: • It's written on a basic level, so no outside preparation is required for students. • It's easy to use and is written with the busy youth leader in mind. • Each book includes four sessions of biblical study that show students how to learn the skill, and lead them to practice it. • It features reproducible worksheets for students. • It offers daily quiet time guides to help teens continue their discipleship experience all week long. • It includes an inspirational leader article and specific helps for teaching. • It's available in a cost-saving quarterly, three–book packet (see the LifeWay Dated Order Form for the most current available three-book packet) with a weekly plan for teaching Sunday morning or Sunday night as well as a seasonal session of study; or available as individual books. • Each session of study is designed to inspire and equip youth to learn key skills. • Each session is full of stories and imagery that captures the attention and imagination of today's teenagers. • Each session engages youth in a life-transforming way.  • It's all interactive and fun!
This particular edition (How to Use Your Spiritual Gifts) helps students learn about: recognizing how God has equipped them for ministry, exercising spiritual gifts, and clarifying their personal missions in life.  (4 sessions)

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1987 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Greensboro (N.C.): The University of North Carolina at Greensboro Theatre 18 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 457012634
