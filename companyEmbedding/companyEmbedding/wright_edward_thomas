Learning to Love the Poems of Edward Thomas
















Amid war, James Wright’s favorite poet found peace in nature.

        By David Rivard




























 













  Edward Thomas Courtesy of Hulton Archive/Getty Images/Wikimedia Commons





I came to “There’s Nothing Like the Sun,” and Edward Thomas’ work in general, quite late, thanks to some of my more inane prejudices. The image I’d developed of Thomas’ poems (without having read many of them) didn’t hold much appeal, not for somebody like me, who has lived in cities all his life. I’ve always loved best the American poets who have been most tuned in to life in those places: Williams and O’Hara in particular. Thomas’ sensibility initially seemed to me the product of “cottage England.” His interest in the natural world seemed … well, sort of unrelenting.


Also, though Thomas is often linked to his friend and influence Robert Frost, for me his speech lacks Frost’s idiomatic salt. Thomas, in comparison, sounds quieter, more reticent—on the sentence level as much as the emotional. His melancholy makes for a tone that is less complex than Frost’s variable inflections: I hear it largely as a kind of elegiac tenderness. I remember thinking Thomas a bit monotonous, where Frost glinted with attitudes.


I found “There’s Nothing Like the Sun” more or less accidentally then, while flipping through an interview with James Wright 30 years after it was published. Thomas may have been Wright’s favorite poet; in a late notebook entry, Wright named 19 people that he would like to have spoken with about poetry, and Thomas tops the list.


Wright’s enthusiasm surely opened me to the poem, but having the poem pop up so unexpectedly probably made me more receptive to Thomas’ work—without my usual defenses, all of them founded on judgments that had been too easily arrived at.


Thomas began writing poetry late in his life, at the age of 36; less than four years later, in 1917, he was dead, killed at the Battle of Arras. This poem was written in 1915, after he’d been posted to Hare Hall Camp by the army, where he served as a map-reading instructor for recently commissioned officers.

His early death, and the way it brought to an end an astoundingly rich (even if brief) run of poetry, certainly imbues the poem with urgency and pathos. Knowing the details of Thomas’ life, you’d have to be a neurological stone not to be moved a bit by it. But, as a reader, I’m fairly immune to the special pleadings of a poet’s biography. And, frankly, the opening sentence of this piece seems on the surface to embody a conventionally agreeable sentiment—not much to argue with there, one might hear oneself thinking. Neither does Thomas’ riffing off Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 130” add any great charge for me—though I do hear something of a challenge beneath the allusion, making clear that what is at stake is one man’s being, undeluded but amazed, clear-eyed.


“The feeling of presence,” said Robert Duncan, when asked what he wanted from poetry, “not concept.” Or, as Frank O’Hara put it, in his typically assertive way, “It’s only ever about being more alive.” That’s what moves me most here—one man’s waking up to the world.


I feel Thomas’ “presence”—his living, breathing responsiveness—most strongly in the middle part of the poem. It starts with the phrase “The south wall warms me,” as if the felt energy recorded there transmits itself into the complex perception that follows: a fleeting glimpse of one or two late-season plums falling from a branch at the same time as a few drops of rainwater, all shaken from the bough (it seems) by the mere singing of a bird.


These lines have something of the heightened perception of a great haiku. And their syntactical flex and compression, their rhythmic variability, are like nothing else in the poem. Elsewhere in the piece, Thomas’ handling of the pentameter is competent, if unremarkable; here, its arranged energy gives the perception immediacy and tension. Compare the passage with the prose entry in Thomas’ notebook that inspired the poem: “Sweet as last damsons on spangled tree when November starling imitates the swallow in sunny interval between rain and all is still dripping.” The difference between the two might be worth about a semester’s worth of craft talk to a young poet.


 Advertisement  




And that bird. That starling, “whistling what once swallows sang.” It’s a commonplace that starlings are mimics, but the line calls out to something genuinely mysterious. The stolen song seems to feed off the energy transmitted by the sun, the heat radiating off the wall. The sound arcs back in time and space—something old is touched in that moment, something familiar but made strange by theft—“once” and forever—something that would be just as at home in Chaucer or the English and Scots ballads. It’s uncanny. As alive then as Thomas himself must have always wanted to be.

“There’s Nothing Like the Sun”


There’s nothing like the sun as the year dies,
Kind as can be, this world being made so,
To stones and men and birds and beasts and flies,
To all things that it touches except snow,
Whether on mountainside or street of town.
The south wall warms me: November has begun,
Yet never shone the sun as fair as now
While the sweet last-left damsons from the bough
With spangles of the morning’s storm drop down
Because the starling shakes it, whistling what
Once swallows sang. But I have not forgot
That there is nothing, too, like March’s sun,
Like April’s, or July’s, or June’s, or May’s,
Or January’s, or February’s, great days:
August, September, October, and December
Have equal days, all different from November.
No day of any month but I have said—
Or, if I could live long enough, should say—
"There’s nothing like the sun that shines today."
There’s nothing like the sun till we are dead.

EDWARD THOMAS WRIGHT
 
 
     WRIGHT, EDWARD
THOMAS, Civil Engineer, Los Angeles, California,
was born at Elgin, Illinois June
30, 1851, the son of Paul Raymond Wright and Emily (Harvey)
Wright.  Mr. Wright has been twice
married, his first wife having been Lucy Nicholson, whom he married at Cobden,
 Illinois, December 11, 1873.  Of this union there were born three children,
George, Charles and Grace, the latter now deceased.  On March 5, 1912, twelve years after the
death of his first wife, Mr. Wright married Capitola B. Wenzil,
at San Diego, California.
     Mr. Wright
received his primary education in the common schools of his native city and
later attended Elgin Academy,
but did not complete the course there, leaving at the age of nineteen years to
enter business.
     At that time
(1870) he went to New Orleans, Louisiana,
and was appointed Journal Clerk of the State Senate of
Louisiana.  He remained there during one
session of the Legislature, resigning at the end of six months service to
return to his home in Illinois.  He spent the balance of the year on his
fathers farm.  In 1871 he made plans to
go to Colorado and learn the
stock-raising business.  After one year
of hardship and cold he changed his mind and went to Indianapolis,
 Indiana, where he took up the study of
landscape architecture in the office of Cleveland & French.  After studying the profession Mr. Wright
represented Cleveland & French for about two years in various parts of the United
 States, the principal office being in St.
  Paul, Minnesota.
     In 1874, Mr.
Wright went to Chicago, and opened
offices with his brother, George F. Wright, as Civil Engineers and
Surveyors.  They had hardly established
themselves, however, when Mr. Wrights health became impaired and he sought the
more congenial climate of Southern California.   Locating in Los Angeles
in the early part of 1875, Mr. Wright established offices as Civil Engineer and
Surveyor and has since continued in that branch of the profession.  He has been honored with public office on
frequent occasions.
     Mr. Wright,
during his long career in Los Angeles,
has taken an active part in the development of the city and vicinity and is
regarded as one of the real upbuilders of the
Southwest.  He has figured as engineer or
surveyor in numerous large land operations, his first large contract having been
the surveying of the Morris Vineyard Tract in Los Angeles
for the Hon. H. K. S. OMelveny, one of the pioneers of the city.  This tract, located at Pico and Main
streets, in now in the center of the modern business district of Los
Angeles.  Another
important work done by Mr. Wright during the first years, his associates being
Frank A. Gibson, George S. Patten, J. M. Elliott and W. G. Cochran, all
important factors in the history of Los Angeles.
     In 1884, Mr.
Wright was elected County Surveyor
a second time and served until 1886, at which time he retired from public life
temporarily to attend to his private affairs. 
In 1895, however, he was again called out of  retirement by his party and was elected
County Surveyor
for the third time.  Upon the expiration
of his term in 1898 he refused to run again and he has been engaged in private
work since that time.
     Mr. Wrights
various administrations as County Surveyor
were marked by numerous improvements which contributed to the progress and
growth of the city and county.
     In addition to
his professional activities, Mr. Wright has been a factor in the social life of
Los Angeles for many years and was
among the founders of what are today the leading clubs of the city.  He was a charter member of the Jonathan Club,
the California Club and the Union League Club, but has resigned from the latter
two.  He has been a member of the
American Society of Civil Engineers, for twenty-seven years and is also a
member of the Engineers and Architects Association of Los Angeles.

in Utah:

Licensing standards in Utah are very strict, offering homeowners peace of mind when hiring contractors. Always check a contractor's references to avoid problems during a construction project. 
Edward Thomas Wright currently holds license 8773242-0301 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Utah?



Utah requires contractors to pass a business and law exam, as well as a trade exam to become licensed. Six hours of continuing education is required to maintain a license in the state. 











Your liability risk when hiring Edward Thomas Wright



Utah requires licensed contractors to carry workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of both insurance certificates for your records before the start of any work.











Financial recourse when hiring Edward Thomas Wright



Licensed contractors in Utah must obtain a surety bond before performing work on residential properties. Home owners can file a claim against this bond to recoup losses or damages in the event of faulty work.











What else should I know before hiring Edward Thomas Wright



Utah requires license applicants to submit a credit report with their application.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Utah, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

About Selected Poems and Prose
Finally back in Penguin Classics: the poems and prose of cult WWI writer Edward Thomas, with a new introduction by Robert Macfarlane, author ofThe Old Ways   Beloved writer Edward Thomas is best known for his evocative poetry, though his writing career was varied and prolific, with more than two thousand reviews and nearly thirty volumes of topography, biography, and literary criticism published by the time of his death at age thirty-nine in World War I. After years of writing about poetry, Thomas, an intensely contemplative man who believed deeply in the power of perambulation, was encouraged by his close friend Robert Frost to write his own verse.
