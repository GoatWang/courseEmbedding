About Algar, Inc.

Algar Inc, is a company specializing in New and Used Auto Parts, as well as automotive and metal recycling. The Auto Parts division is engaged in the business of selling used and new auto parts to body shops, car dealers, auto parts dealers and walk in retail customers. The automotive and metal recycling division purchases junk and wrecked cars from auto parts yards, wreckers and individuals in order to process and recycle. Algar, Inc. offers a “Total Package” concept to all of its customers. The ferrous division’s major products include recycling of steel and iron products, whereas the non-ferrous division recycles copper, aluminum, and brass. Combining the auto parts division with the auto recycling division, Algar, Inc. provides a “One Stop Shop” for its customer base.
Algar, Inc. believes that it offers a more complete line of products and services than its competitors and is better able to coordinate these services on a local, regional and nationwide basis. Utilizing our computer network, Algar, Inc. is linked to over 2500 auto part dealers across the country. This allows us to offer top quality as well as the most competitively priced auto parts for both import and domestic cars. Additionally, by operating a U-pick lot, inventoried parts yard and auto recycling yard, we are able to provide services to all of our customers.

Mission to Our Customers:
Our customers are the most important people in our business.
Our customers are not dependent on us.  We are dependent on them.
Our customers are not interruptions of our work.  They are the purpose of it.
Our customers are an essential part of our business – not outsiders.  They are human beings with feelings and deserve to be treated with respect.
Our customers come to us with their needs and wants.  It is our job to fulfill them.
Our customers deserve the most courteous attention we can give them. They are the lifeblood of our company.  They  pay our salary and wages.  Without them we would have to close our doors.  We must never forget that.
It is our corporate mission to give our customers our very best pricing – our best service – and to continue to improve our business, our people and our products to ensure that “our customers” view Algar, Inc. as an organization upon whom they can depend.
THANK YOU FOR BEING OUR CUSTOMER.   PLEASE LET US KNOW HOW WE CAN IMPROVE.
