RXi Pharmaceuticals Is Exploring Strategic Options
May 10 16
RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NasdaqCM:RXII) announced that it is in the process of exploring strategic options including a range of potential M&A and business development opportunities designed to enhance shareholder value. As part of this effort, RXi has engaged Griffin Securities, Inc. for one of these transactions. "Following our recent reverse stock split and the full conversion of our preferred stock at the end of 2015, we have successfully reset the Company's capital structure and are now better positioned to execute on one or more strategic transactions that would significantly advance our Company," stated Geert Cauwenbergh, President and Chief Executive Officer of RXi. "In furtherance of this goal, we have engaged Griffin Securities and are in active discussions regarding a potential merger transaction that, if successful, would be expected to bring substantial synergies to the combined business and significantly advance our clinical pipeline." He added that: "We are pleased to be working with the highly experienced team at Griffin, and to tap into their expertise in working on this type of project. Although there can be no assurance that the exploration of any alternatives will result in RXi entering into or consummating a transaction, we are committed to enhancing our growth through this type of transactions, and are actively engaged in activities to arrive at this goal." There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction. The Company does not intend to provide updates unless or until it determines that disclosure is appropriate or necessary.
