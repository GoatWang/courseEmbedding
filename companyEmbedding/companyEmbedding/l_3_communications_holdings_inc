History[edit]
L3 was formed as L-3 Communications in 1997 to acquire certain business units from Lockheed Martin that had previously been part of Loral Corporation. These units had belonged to Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta, which had merged three years before in 1993.[3] The company was founded by (and named for) Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta in partnership with Lehman Brothers. Lanza and LaPenta had both served as executives at Loral and Lockheed.[4]
L3 continued to expand through mergers and acquisitions to become one of the top ten U.S. government contractors.[5]

Management[edit]
Frank Lanza, CEO and co-founder, died on June 7, 2006. CFO Michael T. Strianese was named as interim CEO, and was later appointed Chairman, President and CEO of the company on October 23, 2006. In 2015, former Lockheen Martin executive Christopher E. Kubasik was named President and COO, with Strianese remaining as Chairman and CEO.[18] On July 19, 2017, Strianese announced that he would retire as CEO on December 31, 2017, to be succeeded by Kubasik, but would remain as board chairman.[19]
Naming[edit]
L3 Technologies was originally named L-3 Communications for the last initials of its founders Frank Lanza, Robert LaPenta, and Lehman Brothers. Despite the similarity in naming, there is no corporate connection between L3 Technologies, formerly known as L-3 Communications, and networking provider Level 3 Communications, whose name is often abbreviated "L3" in informal industry communication.
On December 31, 2016, L3's company name changed from L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. to L3 Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the company's wider focus since its founding in 1997. The company's website changed from L-3com.com to L3T.com, but the company's NYSE ticker symbol of LLL remained the same.[20]
Products[edit]

L-3 ProVision, Millimeter Wave Airport Passenger Screening System
L-3 eXaminer SX, 3DX, and XLB, Airport baggage scanning systems
L-3 OptEX, Trace level explosive detection system
AVCATT, a mobile aviation training simulator
Orchid,[21] Total Development & Simulation Environment (Power, Marine)
EOTech, Holographic weapon sights
L-3 Sonoma EO, Electro Optical Imaging Systems, 1508M Dragon Eyes, 1205MD, 2111X, 2514X, & 2711G

Controversies[edit]
Federal contract suspension[edit]
In 2010 it was announced that L3's Special Support Programs Division had been suspended by the United States Air Force from doing any contract work for the US federal government. A US Department of Defense investigation had reportedly found that the company had, "used a highly sensitive government computer network to collect competitive business information for its own use." A US federal criminal investigation[22] ended the temporary suspension on July 27, 2010.
Counterfeit parts[edit]
On November 4, 2010 L3 issued a part purge notification to prevent future use of Chinese counterfeit parts, but did not notify its customers whose display systems suffered from much higher than expected failure rates.[23]
EOTech Defective Holographic Sights Lawsuit[edit]
In 2015, L3 Technologies agreed to pay $25.6 million to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. Government. L3 was accused of knowingly providing the U.S. military with optics that failed in extreme temperatures and humid weather conditions. These sights were provided to infantry and special operations forces operating in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as civilians and law enforcement.[24]
The civil fraud lawsuit was filed by Preet Bharara, in the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged L3 officials have known since 2006 that the holographic sights being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan failed to perform as advertised in extreme temperature ranges. The lawsuit alleges that the FBI independently discovered the thermal drift defect in March 2015 and presented EOTech with "the very same findings that the company had documented internally for years. Shortly thereafter, EOTech finally disclosed the thermal drift defect to DoD." According to court documents, EOTech had advertised that its sights performed in temperatures ranging from -40 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and in humid conditions.[25]
In temperature extremes the sights exhibited thermal drift, which is when the sight's point of aim differed from its point of impact.[24]|
John Bailey, director of marketing at EOtech said,

Thermal drift is basically when you go from ambient temperature to temperature extreme there is going to be a point of impact shift...We have realized that our sight could shift … in those extremes, -40 and 122 Fahrenheit.
— John Bailey, "EOTech Breaks Silence over Defective Sights" military.com

The sights also suffered from reticle fading and parallax.

History[edit]
L3 was formed as L-3 Communications in 1997 to acquire certain business units from Lockheed Martin that had previously been part of Loral Corporation. These units had belonged to Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta, which had merged three years before in 1993.[3] The company was founded by (and named for) Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta in partnership with Lehman Brothers. Lanza and LaPenta had both served as executives at Loral and Lockheed.[4]
L3 continued to expand through mergers and acquisitions to become one of the top ten U.S. government contractors.[5]

Management[edit]
Frank Lanza, CEO and co-founder, died on June 7, 2006. CFO Michael T. Strianese was named as interim CEO, and was later appointed Chairman, President and CEO of the company on October 23, 2006. In 2015, former Lockheen Martin executive Christopher E. Kubasik was named President and COO, with Strianese remaining as Chairman and CEO.[18] On July 19, 2017, Strianese announced that he would retire as CEO on December 31, 2017, to be succeeded by Kubasik, but would remain as board chairman.[19]
Naming[edit]
L3 Technologies was originally named L-3 Communications for the last initials of its founders Frank Lanza, Robert LaPenta, and Lehman Brothers. Despite the similarity in naming, there is no corporate connection between L3 Technologies, formerly known as L-3 Communications, and networking provider Level 3 Communications, whose name is often abbreviated "L3" in informal industry communication.
On December 31, 2016, L3's company name changed from L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. to L3 Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the company's wider focus since its founding in 1997. The company's website changed from L-3com.com to L3T.com, but the company's NYSE ticker symbol of LLL remained the same.[20]

Controversies[edit]
Federal contract suspension[edit]
In 2010 it was announced that L3's Special Support Programs Division had been suspended by the United States Air Force from doing any contract work for the US federal government. A US Department of Defense investigation had reportedly found that the company had, "used a highly sensitive government computer network to collect competitive business information for its own use." A US federal criminal investigation[22] ended the temporary suspension on July 27, 2010.
Counterfeit parts[edit]
On November 4, 2010 L3 issued a part purge notification to prevent future use of Chinese counterfeit parts, but did not notify its customers whose display systems suffered from much higher than expected failure rates.[23]
EOTech Defective Holographic Sights Lawsuit[edit]
In 2015, L3 Technologies agreed to pay $25.6 million to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. Government. L3 was accused of knowingly providing the U.S. military with optics that failed in extreme temperatures and humid weather conditions. These sights were provided to infantry and special operations forces operating in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as civilians and law enforcement.[24]
The civil fraud lawsuit was filed by Preet Bharara, in the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged L3 officials have known since 2006 that the holographic sights being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan failed to perform as advertised in extreme temperature ranges. The lawsuit alleges that the FBI independently discovered the thermal drift defect in March 2015 and presented EOTech with "the very same findings that the company had documented internally for years. Shortly thereafter, EOTech finally disclosed the thermal drift defect to DoD." According to court documents, EOTech had advertised that its sights performed in temperatures ranging from -40 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and in humid conditions.[25]
In temperature extremes the sights exhibited thermal drift, which is when the sight's point of aim differed from its point of impact.[24]|
John Bailey, director of marketing at EOtech said,

Thermal drift is basically when you go from ambient temperature to temperature extreme there is going to be a point of impact shift...We have realized that our sight could shift … in those extremes, -40 and 122 Fahrenheit.
— John Bailey, "EOTech Breaks Silence over Defective Sights" military.com

The sights also suffered from reticle fading and parallax.

About L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.

L3 Technologies (formerly L-3 Communications Holdings) provides products and services to the government based on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), including systems for satellite, avionics (aircraft electronics), and marine communications. Products include simulation, training, and night vision equipment, and L3 also provides aircraft maintenance and modernization services. The US government, primarily the
   
    Department of Defense
   
   (DoD), accounts for nearly 70% of its business, but L3 is expanding its commercial offerings. The company operates through 273 locations around the globe, but the majority of its revenues stem from the US.
  
Operations
L3 operates through four main segments: Electronic Systems, Sensor Systems, Communication Systems, and Aerospace Systems. 
Geographic Reach

   The company operates through 273 locations consisting of manufacturing facilities, administration, research and development and other properties throughout the US and internationally. The US is its largest market, accounting for roughly 80% of total revenue in 2016.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The company's sales are predominantly derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime system contractors to, the US government. In 2016, the
   
    Department of Defense
   
   (DOD) and other government agencies accounted for 73% of its total revenue; the remainder of revenue was contributed by commercial (12%) and foreign governments (15%).

In addition, direct sales to end customers represented 67% of net sales in 2016, and sales acting as a subcontractor or supplier represented the remaining 33%. Sales to L3's five largest contracts generated 15% of total sales; its largest contract was the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract with the US Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command (AMCOM).
Financial Performance

   L3 has seen its net sales slowly diminish over the last five years. In addition, revenues remained static for 2015 and 2016, hovering around the $10.5 billion mark for both years. During 2016, L3 experienced significant sales declines in South Korea (39%), Australia (21%), Saudi Arabia (21%), and Japan (15%). These regions were affected by lower sales related to linguist services, training, and logistics support projects for the
   
    US Army
   
   due to the draw-down of American military forces in Iraq.
  
L3 posted a net loss of $240 million in 2015. The loss was attributed to the selling of its former National Security Solutions (NSS) business in early 2016 and led to the incurring of impairment charges and a loss from discontinued operations for 2015.
 With this divestiture behind it, L3 posted positive net income of $710 million in 2016. 
Strategy

   With such a major amount of business derived from the US government and DoD (the US Army and
   
    Air Force
   
   collectively account for about 70% of its total revenue), the company is vulnerable to the priorities of the Pentagon and other government agencies, which have resulted in cuts in defense spending and additional troop withdrawals from the Middle East.
  

   In addition, the company enters into collaborative ventures with other businesses to develop new opportunities, especially in the area of providing full-service, rather than just products. Additionally, L3 has been transitioning from providing individual products and components to bundled products and services, including logistics, MRO (maintenance, repair, and overall), and supply chain management. Its revenues from services is now neck-and-neck with that of its products, and L3 plans to add additional services under existing programs.
  

   To focus on this strategy, in early 2016 L3 sold its former National Security Solutions (NSS) business to
   
    CACI International
   
   for $550 million.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions
In early 2017, L3 acquired the explosives trace detection (ETD) business of Massachusetts-based Implant Sciences Corporation for $118 million in cash. L3 will integrate Implant into its security and detection systems division within its electronic systems business segment. The transaction enhanced its capabilities within the global aviation security and national security markets and allowed it to capitalize on significant opportunities in the growing security and detection market.
In 2016, the company obtained Micreo Limited, located in Brisbane, Australia. Micreo is a market leader in the design and production of RF and photonic products for radar and electronic warfare, and its products are currently installed in several of the world’s frontline military aircraft and ships. The deal complemented the company’s electronic warfare capabilities and expanded its Australian footprint.

   In 2015, L3 snapped up UK-headquartered CTC Aviation Group (now known as L-3 CTC Ltd) for $220 million. L-3 CTC is a global airline pilot training and crew resourcing specialist catering to major airlines and retail customers globally. The acquisition expanded L3's commercial aviation training business.

L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.










600 3rd Avenue, 34th FloorNew York, New York 10016U.S.A.


Company Perspectives:

L-3 Communication's goal is to be the leading mezzanine supplier to prime contractors. The company will do so by investing in its core technologies and acquiring companies that enhance or complement its current technologies.
History of L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.








L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc., through its L-3 Communications Corp. subsidiary, operates companies that produce secure communication systems, training systems, microwave components, avionics and ocean systems, telemetry, instrumentation, and space and wireless products. Its customers are mostly defense and intelligence agencies, as well as aircraft manufacturers and defense contractors. L-3 also supplies the commercial telecommunications industry. L-3 maintained a 60 percent defense, 40 percent commercial product mix. Like its predecessor Loral Corporation, L-3 Communications has undergone phenomenal growth, orchestrated by former Loral executives Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta.

Origins

Loral Corporation was an assemblage of defense units acquired from Fairchild, Ford, IBM, Unisys, and others between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s by Wall Street investor Bernard L. Schwartz. In April 1996, Lockheed Martin acquired most of these businesses for $9.1 billion. Two Loral executives, COO Frank Lanza and comptroller Robert LaPenta, joined Lockheed Martin as executive vice-president and vice-president, respectively. Loral's space businesses formed a separate firm, Loral Space & Communications Ltd., run by Schwartz.
Lockheed Martin, which had been formed in 1995 by the merger of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp., began to divest noncore units after the massive Loral acquisition. It sold its stake in the Martin Marietta construction materials business in 1996.
Lanza, described by the Washington Post as "a taciturn New Yorker admired for his creativity and engineering genius," reportedly felt stifled by the bureaucratic corporate atmosphere at Lockheed Martin. An electrical engineer by training, Lanza had joined Loral in 1972 and was named president and chief operating officer in 1981. Along the way, he was instrumental in growing the company from modest origins to a $7 billion giant.
In 1997, as he approached traditional retirement age, Lanza convinced his new employer, Lockheed Chairman Norman R. Augustine, to spin off ten former Loral companies to form L-3 Communications. ("It took me less than half an hour to get a yes," Lanza later told Business Week.) Lanza finally got a chance to be CEO, and numbers whiz LaPenta was named president and chief financial officer.
The ten businesses spun off had annual revenues of $650 million and 4,900 employees. The largest of these were Wideband Systems in Salt Lake City and Communications Systems in Camden, New Jersey. Also included were two northern California companies, Randtron and Narda-Microwave, which manufactured microwave antennas for military applications. These two together had fewer than 400 employees.
Lockheed Martin received $503.8 million for selling 65 percent of its ownership in the ten companies. After the sale, a limited partnership led by Lehman Brothers owned half of L-3; Lockheed Martin retained a 35 percent interest and a management group accounted for another 15 percent. Lockheed agreed to invest $43.75 million in L-3, Lehman invested $62.5 million, and the management group provided $43.75 million. Another $375 million was financed with bank debt and high-yield bonds. The name of the new company came from Lanza, LaPenta, and either Lockheed or Lehman Brothers, according to varying reports.
In July 1997 L-3 found itself aggressively bidding against its part-owner, Lockheed Martin, for control of a Texas Instruments chip-making business that Raytheon was being forced to unload as part of a Justice Department settlement. The desired unit produced gallium arsenide high-power amplifier monolithic microwave integrated circuits, or MMICs, a proprietary product. L-3 was eager to expand its microwave components business, which accounted for a quarter of sales, and also sought out joint ventures with Sweden's Ericsson Microwave Systems AB and France's Thomson-CSF to bring new technologies into the U.S. military market.








L-3 had a well-developed commercial business as well. Its Advanced Recorders plant in Sarasota, Florida, which made "black boxes" for aircraft, landed a contract to supply American Airlines with solid-state flight data recorders for both its existing fleet and planes on order with Boeing. The deal had a potential value of $16 million.

1998 IPO

L-3's first year revenues were $701 million. Plans for a $100 million initial public offering (IPO) were announced in February 1998. The IPO at $22 a share came on May 19; in the next six months the company's share price would rise to $46 a share, helped by strong earnings.
Lanza's acquisition strategy was to buy technology leaders, either struggling independent companies or black sheep divisions of major defense contractors, observed Business Week. Lanza focused on small to medium sized companies to avoid costly takeover battles with aerospace giants. ESSCO, a leading producer of ground-based radomes (protective shields for antennas) and precision millimeter wave antenna systems, acquired in September 1998, was a representative purchase.
By November 1998, L-3 had already acquired seven companies, including SPD Technologies, which supplied power equipment to the U.S. Navy, and Storm Control Systems, Inc., which made satellite control software. The company spent heavily--$40 to $50 million a year--on R&D to improve its existing products and to make them cheaper to produce.
In December 1998, L-3 agreed to acquire Microdyne Corp., based in Alexandria, Virginia, for $90 million. Microdyne made radio receivers used in tracking satellites and aircraft. L-3 companies already made the data hardware that used these antennas.
L-3 posted after-tax profits of $32 million on revenues of $1 billion in 1998. An additional stock offering was announced in early 1999, intending to raise $136 million to pay down debt and fund further acquisitions.
In December 1999, L-3 agreed to pay $55 million for two businesses Honeywell International Inc. was required to sell after its merger with Allied Signal Inc. One of these produced gyroscopes, controlled momentum devices, and sensors for weapons systems and satellites; the other made an inertial sensor product based on micromachined electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology used in advanced guidance systems. L-3 also bought Honeywell's Traffic-Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) business for $255 million. L-3 incorporated the TCAS unit into a joint venture with Sextant, a Thomson-CSF affiliate. TCAS had recently been required on all European cargo aircraft and passenger planes with more than 30 seats.
Another important acquisition in 1999 was that of Satellite Transmission Systems. This brought L-3 into a $200 million a year business of fixed wireless communications systems, typically installed in developing countries that lacked traditional land lines. Meanwhile, new Federal Aviation Administration requirements were boosting L-3's cockpit voice recorder business.
In January 2000, L-3 agreed to buy Raytheon Company's flight simulation and training business for $160 million. Link Simulation and Training, based in Arlington, Virginia, became L-3's largest division, with $300 million a year in revenues. Link had pioneered the earliest mechanical flight simulators in the first decades of aviation, but had languished in later years as it was shuffled among a succession of corporate foster parents; Lanza declared L-3 was committed to help Link thrive in the growing training market. In March 2001, however, L-3 sued Raytheon to cancel its acquisition agreement, alleging that Raytheon failed to disclose liabilities in the business.

Bigger Game in the New Millennium

When Institutional Investor asked Lanza L-3's next move in November 2000, he quipped, "We're gonna go buy Lockheed." L-3's impressive growth made this a less than outrageous prospect. The company's share price reached $80 by the end of the year. A new stock offering announced in April 2001 was to raise $350 million.
In the spring of 2001, Lanza announced that he was changing his acquisition strategy to buy larger companies in a bid to become "the Home Depot of the defense industry." He aimed for L-3 to have revenues of $6 or $7 billion within the next several years--a stretch for what was then a $2 billion company, but not a laughable one, especially given Lanza's reputation. Faster growth was deemed necessary to compete against Honeywell International Inc., which was being acquired by (the U.S.) General Electric Co., reported the Wall Street Journal.

At the 2001 Paris Air Show, Lanza told www.AviationNow .com that L-3 was a catalog company. It was more efficient, he said, to approach the handful of major aerospace companies with a vast array of products, than to try to vie for their business as a small, $100 million supplier. L-3 also boasted considerable financial resources and R&D capabilities and offered administrative efficiencies to the companies it acquired.
