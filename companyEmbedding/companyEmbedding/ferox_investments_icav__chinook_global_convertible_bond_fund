	The principals of the Firm - Jeremy Herrmann and Rupert Mathews have multi-year experience in the convertibles industry and continue to manage our actively-managed products on a day to day basis.  As highly experienced portfolio managers (with over 40 years of convertible experience between them) they provide the core, partner-level decision engine for all the actively-managed fund products we offer.

	They are supported by a team of six investment professionals with extensive industry experience who seek to facilitate our bottom up research process and identify the best risk/reward trades across the convertible spectrum.  Our team of credit and technical analysts is organised to cover the global convertible market and facilitate a fluid and efficient portfolio decision-making process. The research team is made up of two credit analysts (Simon Tan and Cedric Milcendeau) who are responsible for the analysis of the convertible universe from a credit perspective.  Head of Research (Liam O’Byrne) is responsible for prospectus analysis and provides technical analysis of prospectuses and corporate actions. Convertible Bond Specialist (Robert Coe) and Convertible Bond Analyst (Faisal Ishaq) scan the convertible universe for potential opportunities and, along with Joshua Mace-Jones execute trades. Robert Coe is also Portfolio Manager for our systematic offering - Ferox Investments ICAV –Chinook Global Convertible Bond Fund.  The Firm has developed a robust infrastructure over the last seventeen years which is managed by industry specialists and currently employs 25 people.

Welcome to Ferox Capital LLP
Ferox Capital LLP is a discretionary investment  manager specialising in generating returns from diversified global convertible  bond strategies. The Firm was founded in 2000 by Jeremy Herrmann, Alex Warren  and Rupert Mathews.  The Firm runs a number of convertible bond strategies  (including long-only and leveraged, UCITS and Cayman, active and systematic)  that focus on all parts of the convertible spectrum.  The investment  process continues to be managed by Jeremy and Rupert who personally invest  heavily in the funds that they manage.

Disclosure of commitment to the 
Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (The Code) under FCA COBS 
2.2.3R.
Ferox Capital LLP (The Firm) is an 
investment manager based in the United Kingdom and authorised and regulated by 
the Financial Conduct Authority. We endeavour to apply our approach on 
stewardship to all companies that we invest in on behalf of our clients. Our 
approach is consistent with the Firms overall aims, which are to provide good 
long-term performance to our clients, and keeping clients interests paramount. 

The Firm monitors all investee companies 
as part of its general investment policy and approach. The Firm takes action in 
line with its investment objectives where its research of publically available 
information warrants such action. However, given the nature of our chosen 
investment strategy, this approach does not include active engagement with UK

engagement.   If our investment strategy changes in such a manner 
that the provisions of the Code become relevant, the Firm will amend this 
disclosure accordingly.

Global Macro Shifts











WHAT IS GLOBAL MACRO SHIFTS?


Global Macro Shifts is a research-based briefing on global economies featuring the analysis and views of Dr. Michael Hasenstab and senior members of Templeton Global Macro.



Latest edition



Trade and Taxes in a World with Borders
US policy continues to be an important topic for investors throughout the world. Recently, the potential for US corporate tax reform and a border adjustment tax (BAT) stirred debate not only within the US government but also among global investors. Templeton Global Macro examines how a BAT would work, its likely effect on prices and exchange rates, its implications for the longer-term macroeconomic outlook, its impact on different domestic sectors and trade flows, and the potential ramifications for international trade relations.​

What Are the Risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Thus, as the prices of bonds adjust to a rise in interest rates, the share price may decline. Investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. Investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets’ smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Such investments could experience significant price volatility in any given year. High yields reflect the higher credit risk associated with these lower-rated securities and, in some cases, the lower market prices for these instruments. Interest rate movements may affect the share price and yield. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Treasuries, if held to maturity, offer a fixed rate of return and fixed principal value; their interest payments and principal are guaranteed.

Global Macro Shifts











WHAT IS GLOBAL MACRO SHIFTS?


Global Macro Shifts is a research-based briefing on global economies featuring the analysis and views of Dr. Michael Hasenstab and senior members of Templeton Global Macro.

Recently, the potential for US corporate tax reform and a border adjustment tax (BAT) stirred debate not only within the US government but also among global investors. Templeton Global Macro examines how a BAT would work, its likely effect on prices and exchange rates, its implications for the longer-term macroeconomic outlook, its impact on different domestic sectors and trade flows, and the potential ramifications for international trade relations.​
