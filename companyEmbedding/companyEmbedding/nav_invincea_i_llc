Invincea's New Endpoint Security Product Rates Industry Best for Performance



According to AV-TEST Data, X By Invincea Out-Performs Cylance(R) and SentinelOne 
FAIRFAX, VA--(Marketwired - May 11, 2016) - Endpoint security software company Invincea today released a new endpoint security product called X. Representing a departure from how security products are typically conceived and engineered, X was built from the ground up to secure companies' endpoints without sacrificing business performance. X makes this possible by combining deep learning with behavioral monitoring in one lightweight agent that provides better protection with fewer false positives. "As a beta customer, X by Invincea represents a big leap over other products we've deployed and tested," said Paul Calatayud, Chief Information Security Officer, SureScripts, LLC. "Traditionally, we've been forced to make a trade off between security and employee productivity, but our business demands that we do both effectively. We finally have a product that strikes the right balance."AV-TEST, an independent organization that evaluates and rates antivirus and security suite software, recently completed a private test of X by Invincea. X by Invincea outperformed other endpoint protection products, ranking higher than Cylance and SentinelOne, who were evaluated in prior tests using the same methodology."In a recent AV-TEST endpoint protection test, Invincea scored high marks for performance and protection," said Maik Morgenstern, CTO, AV-TEST. "For performance, Invincea had one of the best scores we have ever seen in our tests to date. And, for protection, Invincea blocked 100% of attacks from 64 malicious websites. No other signature-less endpoint protection product provided 100% detection and blocking for this category in previous tests.""Companies remain extremely frustrated that today's endpoint security products force one to choose between protection and performance," said Anup Ghosh, CEO, Invincea. "This product was built to eliminate that false choice. Also, early 3rd
party testing and customer feedback suggests that X will set a new employee-first industry standard, while at the same time stopping threats that get past other products."Organizations that deploy X will better protect their enterprise without sacrificing workforce productivity. Benefits include: 

Reduce security risk while meeting compliance requirements -- X combines deep learning (an advanced form of machine learning) with behavioral monitoring to provide a new standard of endpoint protection. As a result, X prevents threats that get past other endpoint protection products, while providing evidence of endpoint security controls for FFIEC, GLBA, PCI, FISMA, and other regulations.
X by Invincea also reduces the overhead and exposure associated with patch management. With X protecting enterprise endpoints, organizations are less vulnerable even if an endpoint doesn't have the latest patch. As a result, IT can now patch on their schedule rather than the vendor's. 

Keep your workforce productive -- Because all of X's capabilities are included in one lightweight agent, it is invisible to employees. There is no impact on workforce productivity. 

Reduce costs, training and overhead --Because X combines multiple capabilities in one product that is easy to deploy and maintain, organizations can replace duplicative, less effective endpoint solutions. X minimizes the need to manage, train and administer multiple solutions, reducing the overhead on security teams and budget.

Invincea Names Christopher Day Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) | Business Wire
























































Invincea Names Christopher Day Chief Information Security Officer 
      (CISO)




Security industry expert formerly of Packet Forensics, Terremark, 
      SteelCloud and current DoD Defense Science Board member joins Invincea 
      to expand and lead malware and threat research teams






October 05, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



FAIRFAX, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Invincea, 
      the machine learning endpoint security company dedicated to killing 
      threats without impacting business performance, today announced the 
      appointment of Christopher Day as Chief Information Security Officer. As 
      a longstanding leader in the cybersecurity private industry community, 
      Chris will use his new role as CISO to lead the strategic cybersecurity 
      vision of Invincea with customers and other key stakeholders in industry 
      and government.
    


      With over twenty years of leadership experience in information security 
      spanning Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, and financial 
      services firms across the globe, Chris most recently was CTO for Packet 
      Forensics, LLC, which provides advanced cybersecurity products and 
      large-scale threat and commercial intelligence services for government 
      and the private sector. Prior to his work with Packet Forensics, LLC, 
      Chris was Chief Security Architect, with Terremark Worldwide, Inc., 
      where he launched the information security practice prior to its 
      acquisition by Verizon.
    

      “The appointment of Chris Day as Invincea’s first Chief Information 
      Security Officer is a testament to the industry wide recognition of 
      Invincea’s products and innovation in attracting the high caliber of 
      security professional Chris represents,” said Anup Ghosh, Invincea 
      Founder and CEO. “Chris’s deep expertise in cybersecurity recognized by 
      the Defense Science Board will enable the company to engage in CISO to 
      CISO conversations directly addressing the security issues CISOs face 
      every day. We are thrilled to have him join our world class team as we 
      accelerate the growth of the company.”
    

      The White House National Security Council invited Chris to participate 
      as Control Staff for the 2012 National Level Exercise which focused 
      heavily on a major cybersecurity crisis. In March 2013, he was appointed 
      by the Secretary of Defense to the DoD’s Defense Science Board. Chris 
      has deep experience in the areas of security audit, vulnerability 
      assessment, computer forensics and secure systems design.
    

      “Invincea has created the most advanced machine learning endpoint 
      solution on the market that helps solve a myriad of security challenges 
      CISOs face today,” said Chris Day, Invincea CISO. “The innovation that 
      comes from Invincea Labs, based on DARPA driven technology, is the 
      perfect combination of national security insights married to private 
      sector innovation to face today’s most advanced threats to the endpoint. 
      I look forward to engaging with CISOs and security teams to help them 
      overcome security challenges now and in the future.”
    

      Chris regularly lectures on advanced threats, computer forensics, 
      incident response, intrusion detection/prevention, and wireless 
      technology security. He is a contributing author for the books “Going 
      Mobile: Building the Real-Time Enterprise with Mobile Applications that 
      Work” and “Computer and Information Security Handbook” (1st and 2nd 
      Editions). Chris has authored and co-authored four patents in the areas 
      of Intrusion Detection, Wireless Network Security, Information Security 
      Auditing and Incident Investigation, and Reconfigurable Virtualized 
      Remote Computer Security System, respectively.
    

      To learn more about Chris and his view on “Why he joined Invincea,” see 
      his blog post here.
