RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on eight P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value 
(LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio 
(DSCR), and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf) are 
within acceptable ranges.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.2% 
of the current balance, the same as Moody's last review. 
Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is now 4.2% 
of the original pooled balance, the same as Moody's last review. 
Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit 
and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 45, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the January 18, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1.1% to $1.036 
billion from $1.048 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 95 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 6.0% of the pool, with the 
top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 36.9% 
of the pool.




Six loans, constituting 7.9% of the pool, are 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's has assumed a high default probability for two poorly performing 
loans, constituting 0.8% of the pool, and has 
estimated an aggregate loss of $2.1 million (a 26% 
expected loss based on a 75% probability default) from these troubled 
loans.




Moody's received full or partial year 2015 operating results for 89% 
of the pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 
98% of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 116%, compared 
to 117% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 9.5% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 10.0%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.49X and 0.94X, 
respectively, compared to 1.45X and 0.93X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 15.1% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Westfield Palm Desert Loan ($62.5 
million -- 6.0% of the pool), which represents 
a pari passu portion of a $125.0 million first-mortgage 
loan. The loan is secured by a 573,000 SF component of a 
978,000 SF regional mall located in Palm Desert, California. 
The mall's anchor tenants include Sears, JC Penney, 
and Macy's. The property was 98% occupied as of June 
2016. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 105% and 0.98X, 
respectively, the same as Moody's last review.




The second largest loan is the WP Carey Self Storage Portfolio VI Loan 
($48.1 million -- 4.6% of the pool), 
which is secured by nine self-storage facilities located across 
four states including Florida (5), Texas (2), Georgia (1), 
and California (1). The portfolio contains a total of 6,750 
standard storage units, 380 RV/boat spaces, and six commercial 
units. Among the storage units, 2,624 units (41%) 
are climate controlled. The properties were constructed between 
1974 and 2009. The combined portfolio was 93% leased as 
of September 2016, compared to 86% at securitization. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 121% and 0.86X, 
respectively, the same as Moody's last review.




The third largest loan is the 312 Elm Loan ($46.1 million 
-- 4.4% of the pool), which is secured by a 26-story, 
Class A office building located in the CBD of Cincinnati, Ohio. 
The building contains 16-stories of office space and a 10-story 
parking garage. The property was 79% occupied as of September 
2016. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 106% and 1.02X, 
respectively, the same as Moody's last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, is stopped by reporters as he passes by the Senate. When Congress created the Congressional Budget Office in 1974 to rein in President Nixon’s abuse of power, Steve Bell was a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill involved in the process.

A study published last year found that African Americans are almost three times more likely than white people to be killed by the police’s use of force. “We expected many economic or demographic variables such as the overall wealth of an area, residential segregation, average levels of education in the area, or overall crime levels, to be involved,” said the report's lead author, Eric Hehman.Lethal police force against blacks linked to community racial bias: studyAFPYou can predict how many blacks are killed by police by measuring the racism of whites, research findsLos Angeles TimesYahoo News ExclusivesKatie CouricSeth Moulton thinks Democrats need ‘new generation’ of leadershipMichael IsikoffRussian-American lobbyist: I just strolled into Trump Jr. meetingMatt BaiTrump to Sessions: ‘You’re kind of fired!

Announcement: Moody's: No negative impact on CGCMT 2015-GC27 and WFCM 2015-C27 from the Transfer of Special Servicing for the Boca Hamptons Plaza Portfolio Loan






                    Global Credit Research - 12 Jun 2015
                









New York, June 12, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) was informed that the Controlling 
Note Holder and Majority Subordinate Certificate holder have elected to 
transfer special servicing to Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC from 
Midland Loan Services. The Proposed Transfer will become effective 
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the governing documents.




Moody's has reviewed the Proposed Transaction and has determined that 
these actions will not in and of themselves, result in a downgrade 
or withdrawal of the current ratings to any class of certificates rated 
by Moody's for Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-C27, 
Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2015-C27 
and Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-GC27 Commercial Mortgage 
Pass-Through Certificates. Moody's opinion only addresses 
the credit impact associated with the proposed actions. Moody's 
is not addressing any opinion as to whether these changes, have 
or could have, other non-credit related effects that may 
have a detrimental impact on the interests of note holders and/or counterparties.




Moody's will continue to monitor the ratings. Any change in the 
ratings will be publicly disseminated by Moody's through appropriate media.


This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For 
any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Approximately $855 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, February 26, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on eight classes in 
Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-C27, Commercial 
Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2015-C27 
as follows:

Cl. B, Affirmed A1 (sf); previously on Mar 12, 
2015 Definitive Rating Assigned A1 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.2% 
of the current balance. Moody's provides a current list of 
base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at 


http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255. 





FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 45, 
the same as at securitization.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the February 18, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by less than 1% to 
$1.043 billion from $1.048 billion at securitization. 
The certificates are collateralized by 95 mortgage loans ranging in size 
from less than 1% to 6% of the pool, with the top 
ten loans constituting 37% of the pool.




Five loans, constituting 1% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's received partial year 2015 operating results for 73% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 117%, 
essentially the same as at securitization. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 17% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
10.0%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.45X and 0.93X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization. Moody's 
actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual 
debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 15% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Westfield Palm Desert Loan ($62.5 
million -- 6% of the pool), which is secured 
by a two-story, enclosed regional mall located in Palm Desert, 
California. The loan represents a pari-passu portion of 
a $125 million mortgage loan. Westfield acquired the mall 
in 1999 and subsequently invested nearly $100 million in upgrading 
and redeveloping the property. The mall totals 978,000 SF 
of which 572,700 collateralizes the subject loan. The mall 
is anchored by a Macy's, Sears and J.C. Penney, 
all of which are not part of the collateral. As of September 2015, 
the mall was 97% leased, excluding anchor tenants. 
As of December 2014, in-line sales averaged $357 PSF 
($330 PSF excluding all jewelry, kiosk, pads and food 
court tenants. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 105% and 
0.98X, respectively, the same as at securitization.




The second largest loan is the WPC Self Storage Portfolio VI Loan ($48.1 
million -- 5% of the pool), which is secured 
by nine self-storage facilities located across four states including 
Florida (5), Texas (2) Georgia (1) and California (1). The 
portfolio contains a total of 6,750 standard storage units, 
380 RV/Boat spaces and six commercial units. Among the storage 
units, 2,624 units (41%) are climate controlled. 
The properties were constructed between 1974 and 2009. As of September 
2015, the combined portfolio was 92% leased, compared 
to 86% at securitization. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 122% and 0.86X, respectively, the same as 
at securitization.




The third largest loan is the 312 Elm Loan ($46.1 million 
-- 4% of the pool), which is secured by a 26-story, 
Class-A office tower located in the CBD of Cincinnati, Ohio. 
The building contains 16 floors of office space over a 10-story 
parking garage. Among the 16 floors of office space, six 
are multi-tenanted and ten are single tenant. As of September 
2015, the property was 84% leased, essentially the 
same as at securitization. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 106% 
and 1.02X, respectively, the same as at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors.

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

John McCain, R-Ariz., shocked his conservative colleagues early Friday morning by defying President Trump to cast the decisive vote against the Republican Party’s bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. With Democrats firmly opposed, the GOP could afford only two Republican defections to gut Obamacare.

Approximately $859 million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, March 12, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to eight classes of CMBS 
securities, issued by Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-C27 
Mortgage Trust, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, 
Series 2015-C27. 




Cl. A-1, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-3, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-4, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)

Cl. A-S, Definitive Rating Assigned Aa2 (sf)


Cl. B, Definitive Rating Assigned A1 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 95 fixed-rate loans secured 
by 124 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and 
the structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.49x is higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 1.31X. The Moody's Stressed DSCR 
of 0.93x is slightly higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction 
average of 0.92X.




The pooled Trust loan balance of $1.05 billion represents 
an all-in Moody's LTV ratio of 117.3%, which 
is higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6% 
and higher than most pools securitized during 2014.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.46, which is in line 
with most multi-borrower transactions since 2009.




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity 
when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan level diversity, 
the pool's loan level Herfindahl Index is 45.4. The transaction 
is more diverse than most conduit transactions rated since 2010.




With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property level 
Herfindahl score is 54.7. The transaction's property diversity 
profile is higher than most multi-borrower transactions issued 
since 2010.




This deal has a super-senior Aaa class with 30% credit enhancement. 
Although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate 
holders provides additional protection against pool loss, the super-senior 
structure is credit negative for the certificate that supports the super-senior 
class. If the support certificate were to take a loss, the 
loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis. 
Thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default 
in recognition that their loss-given default is higher. 
This adjustment helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across 
deals. The transaction was structured with additional subordination 
at class A-S to mitigate the potential increased severity to class 
A-S.




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




Moody's analysis employs the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v3.0 
which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted 
loan level proceeds derived from Moody's loan level DSCR and LTV ratios. 
Major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure, 
property type, sponsorship and diversity.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5%, 
14%, and 23%, the model-indicated rating 
for the currently rated senior Aaa (sf) class would be Aaa, Aa1, 
Aa3, respectively. Parameter Sensitivities are not intended 
to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time; 
rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how 
the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial 
rating process differed. The analysis assumes that the deal has 
not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact 
of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. 
Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process, 
so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from 
the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's received and took into account one or more third-party 
assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a 
neutral impact on the credit rating. 




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF399234.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

 Item 1117
of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings.

  

 The
registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving
the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine
litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties,
and the following, with respect to Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as trustee, certificate administrator and
custodian:

 

On June
18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil
complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York
County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee
under 276 residential mortgage backed securities
(“RMBS”) trusts, which was later amended on July 18,
2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts.  On
November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily
dismiss the state court action without prejudice.  That same
day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (the “District Court”) against Wells Fargo Bank,
alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274
RMBS trusts (the “Complaint”). In December 2014, the
plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss their original
state court action was granted.  As with the prior state court
action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed
contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank,
HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of
institutional investor plaintiffs.  The Complaint against
Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to
investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other
things, the trustee's alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase
obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of
representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged
events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan
servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care
following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money
damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and
equitable relief.  Other cases (collectively, the
“Additional Complaints”) alleging similar causes of
action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees
in the same court by RMBS investors in these and other
transactions, and these cases have been consolidated before the
same judge. On January 19, 2016, an order was entered in connection
with the Complaint in which the District Court declined to exercise
jurisdiction over 261 trusts at issue in the Complaint; the
District Court also allowed Plaintiffs to file amended complaints
if they so chose, and three amended complaints have been filed.
There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or
the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS
trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies liability and believes
that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good
faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to
investors, and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to
contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.

Report on Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing
Criteria
 
Midland Loan Services (“Midland”), a division of PNC
Bank, National Association, is responsible for assessing compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d)
of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“Regulation AB”), as set forth in Appendix A.
 
Midland has assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the
“Reporting Period”). In making this assessment, Midland
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB.
This report covers all transactions serviced on the
Enterprise! Loan Management System (the
“Platform”).
 
Midland engaged certain vendors, which are not servicers as defined
in item 1101(j) of Regulation AB (the “Vendors”), to
perform specific, limited or scripted activities related to
portions of the servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix
A.  Midland elects to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria or portion of the servicing
criteria applicable to such Vendors’ activities as set forth
in Appendix A. Midland has not identified and is not aware of any
material instances of noncompliance by the Vendors with the
applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2015 and for the
Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole, nor
has it identified any material deficiencies in  its policies
and procedures to monitor the compliance by the Vendors with the
applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2015 and for the
Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.
 
Based on this assessment, Midland believes that, as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2015, Midland has complied in all material
respects with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB.
 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on
Midland’s assessment of compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria as of and for the  year ended December 31,
2015.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING
CRITERIA 
 
The management (“ Management ”) of the Corporate
Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the “ Company ”) is responsible for assessing
the Company’s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Management has determined
that the servicing criteria are applicable in regards to the
servicing platform for the period as follows:
  
Period :  As of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2015 (the “ Period ”).
  
Platform :  The platform consists of commercial
mortgage-backed securities (“ CMBS ”)
transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or
backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration and/or paying agent services and where some or all
of the offered securities for such CMBS transactions were either
(a) publicly-issued pursuant to a registration statement delivered
under the Securities Act of 1933, or (b) privately-issued pursuant
to an exemption from registration where the Company has an
obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the
platform excludes any transactions (i) where the offered securities
were issued, sponsored or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government sponsored
entity, and (ii) where the offered securities were issued pursuant
to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and for which
the Company outsources all material servicing activities (as
defined by Regulation AB) (the “ CMBS Platform
”).  Appendix A identifies the individual
transactions defined by Management as constituting the CMBS
Platform for the Period.
  
Applicable Servicing Criteria :  All servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) applicable to the Company’s
obligations in the related transaction agreements with respect to
the CMBS Platform for the Period, except for the following
servicing criteria:  1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii),
1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has
determined are not applicable to the activities the Company
performed with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period;
provided however that, with respect to the CMBS Platform (a)
servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable to the activities
the Company performs related to the aggregation of information
received and the conveyance of such information as required by the
transaction agreements for certain transactions, including those
transactions issued on or before November 23, 2015, where
compliance for such activities was previously assessed under other
servicing criteria in accordance with the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance’s Manual of Publicly Available
Interpretations on Regulation AB and Related Rules, Interpretation
11.03 and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable
only to the activities the Company performs related to the process
of making or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the
asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements (the
“ Applicable Servicing Criteria ”). 
  
Third parties classified as vendors :  With respect to
servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor
to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing functions required
by the servicing criterion.  Management has determined that
this vendor is not considered a “servicer” as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the
servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the
SEC’s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation, Section
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (formerly SEC Manual Telephone
Interpretation 17.06) (“ C&DI, 200.06
”).  The Company has policies and procedures in place
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor’s
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing
criterion applicable to the vendor.  Management is solely
responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC
requirements to apply C&DI, 200.06 for the vendor and related
criterion.
 
With respect to the CMBS Platform and the Period, Management
provides the following assessment of the Company’s compliance
with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:
1.     Management is responsible for assessing
the Company’s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria.
2.    Management has assessed the Company’s
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the
servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on
C&DI, 200.06, as described above.  In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB. 
3.    With respect to applicable servicing criteria
1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that
there were no activities performed during the Period with respect
to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events
that would require the Company to perform such activities.
 
4.    Based on such assessment for the Period, the
Company has complied, in all material respects with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. 
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report with respect to Management’s
assessment of the Company’s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING
CRITERIA
 
 
The management (“ Management ”) of the Corporate
Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the “ Company ”) is responsible for assessing
the Company’s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Management has determined
that the servicing criteria are applicable in regards to the
servicing platform for the period as follows:
  
Period :  As of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2015 (the “ Period ”).
  
    
Platform :  The  platform  consists of
residential mortgage-backed securities (“ RMBS
”) transactions backed by pools of residential mortgage loans
and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“ CMBS
”) transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans,
in each case for which the Company provides document custody
services and where the RMBS and CMBS transactions were either (a)
publicly-issued pursuant to a registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933 on or after January 1, 2006, or (b)
privately-issued pursuant to an exemption from registration on or
after January 1, 2006 where the Company has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation
AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions
where the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government
or any government sponsored entity, other than certain
securitizations of residential mortgage loan transactions issued,
sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Company (the “ Document Custody Platform
”).  Appendix A identifies the individual
transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period.
  
Applicable Servicing Criteria :  Management has determined
that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii),
1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii)
are applicable to the Company’s obligations in the related
transaction agreements with respect to the Document Custody
Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the
Document Custody Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is
applicable only as it relates to the Company’s obligation to
review and maintain the required loan documents related to any
additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the
transaction agreements (the “ Applicable Servicing
Criteria ”).  Management has determined that all
other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not
applicable to the Document Custody Platform.
 
With respect to the Document Custody Platform and the Period,
Management provides the following assessment of the Company’s
compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:
 
1.  Management is responsible for assessing the
Company’s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria.
 
2.  Management has assessed the Company’s compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.  In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB.
 
3.  With respect to applicable servicing criteria
1122(d)(1)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that
there were no activities performed during the Period with respect
to the Document Custody Platform, because there were no occurrences
of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities.
 
4.  Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has
complied, in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria.
 
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report with respect to Management’s
assessment of the Company’s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.
