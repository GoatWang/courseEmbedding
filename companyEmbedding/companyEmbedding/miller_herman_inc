Employees of Herman Miller







Marketing

Product Services








Operations








Sales
















You can make a salary making furniture. Or you can make a difference. Or you can work at Herman Miller and make both. Speak up, solve problems, lead others, and be an owner. All while giving back to the community and caring for a better world. Join us and make your mark.
Speak Up
People who speak up and share ideas make for a strong business. Embracing good ideas and sharing the rewards with everyone is one way we stand apart.
Solve Problems
We use design to do that. You don’t have to be a “designer” to make things better—for customers, for the communities we do business in, and for a better world.
Lead
Envision the future and help others reach their potential. Sometimes you’ll lead and other times follow. We believe everyone does both, depending on the problem to be solved.
Own
At Herman Miller everyone can be a shareholder. But more so, you’ll be a stakeholder, because we’re all challenged to design solutions and make decisions that improve our community, our business, and our world.

Herman Miller, Inc., based in Zeeland, Michigan, is a major American manufacturer of office furniture, equipment and home furnishings. It is notable as one of the first companies to produce modern furniture and, under the guidance of Design Director George Nelson, is likely the most prolific and influential producer of furniture of the modernist style. Among classic Herman Miller products are the Equa chair, Aeron chair, Noguchi table, Marshmallow sofa, and the Eames Lounge Chair. Herman Miller is credited with the invention of the office cubicle (originally known as the "Action Office II") in 1968 under then-director of research Robert Propst.[1][2] Herman Miller holds a unique position among furniture manufacturers for having cultivated the talents of a large number of modernist designers, producing a significant number of pieces that are now considered icons of industrial design.

History[edit]




A typical distribution depot, in Chippenham, Wiltshire.


Herman Miller was founded in 1905 as the Star Furniture Co. in Zeeland, Michigan.[2] Initially the company produced high quality furniture, especially bedroom suites, in historic revival styles.[2] In 1909, Dirk Jan De Pree began working for the company as a clerk, and became its president by 1919, when it was renamed The Michigan Star Furniture Co.[2] De Pree and his father-in-law, Herman Miller, purchased 51% of the company stock in 1923 and renamed it the Herman Miller Furniture Company. It became Herman Miller, Inc. in 1960.[2]
Until 1930, the company produced only traditional wood furniture.[2] With the coming of the Great Depression the company was forced to explore new products to survive in a shrinking market[2] and reluctantly hired Gilbert Rohde, a designer who specialized in modernist designs.[2] Rohde turned the company in a totally new direction and in 1933, Herman Miller debuted a line of modern furniture at the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago, Illinois.[2] In 1941, the company opened a showroom in the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and another in New York City. Under Rohde's supervision Herman Miller entered the contract (office) furniture market in 1942, with the introduction of the "Modular Executive Office" Group (EOG), the first in a long line of office furnishings to be produced by the company.[2]
Rohde died in 1944 and was replaced by architect George Nelson, who joined the firm as director of design in 1945.[2] Over the next four decades Nelson was to have an enormous influence upon Herman Miller, not only for his personal design contributions, but also for the talented designers he recruited to its ranks, including; Isamu Noguchi, Charles and Ray Eames, Robert Propst, and textile designer Alexander Girard.[2] Beginning in the late 1940s, the period under Nelson's guidance saw Herman Miller produce some of the world's most iconic pieces of modern furniture, including the Noguchi table, Eames Lounge Chair, Marshmallow sofa, Ball clock (actually produced by Howard Miller Clock Company), and the Sling sofa.[2]
Dirk Jan De Pree continued to serve as Herman Miller CEO until 1961, when he was forced by illness to step down. He was succeeded by his son, Hugh De Pree. Hugh served as company CEO until the mid-1980s, when he was succeeded by his brother Max De Pree, who held the position until 1990.[2]
In 1961, Herman Miller set up the Herman Miller Research Division, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[2] This division developed the "Action Office" line in 1964 under the supervision of Robert Propst and with the design assistance of George Nelson's New York design studio,.[2] Though the initial line, known as "Action Office I", was not a success, it led Propst to develop the "Action Office II" line, which introduced the "Office cubicle".[2] The impact of Action Office II on the workplace revolutionized the office environment. In 1978, Action Office II was renamed simply "Action Office". Herman Miller's line of Action Office products generated sales of over $5 billion as of 1998[update].[2]
George Nelson's influence at Herman Miller gradually declined during the 1970s as new designers joined the company, including Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf, who co-designed the Equa chair (still widely marketed), and in the 1990s developed the highly-successful Aeron chair. In 1981, Herman Miller started to work with the Italian designer Clino T. Castelli on the process of designing physical environments: a so-called Design Primario[2][3] including CMF Design and Ethospace design concept.[4] Designer Tom Newhouse introduced the "Newhouse Group" of free-standing furniture in 1987, and assisted with the "Ethospace" wall panel system for the Action Office line. Ray Wilkes designed the "Modular Seating Group", popularly known as the Chicklet Chairs.[2]
Artist Stephen Frykholm is also noted for his contributions to Herman Miller. From 1970 to 1989, Frykholm produced a series of promotional posters for Herman Miller's annual summer picnics, some of which are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, and remain highly sought-after art prints.[2]
In July 2014, Herman Miller announced it had reached an agreement to purchase the contemporary retailer Design Within Reach (DWR) for $154 million, in a bid to establish itself as a “premier lifestyle brand”.[5]
Workplace[edit]
Herman Miller is consistently recognized as one of Fortune magazine's "Most Admired Companies", having placed at the top of the list for furniture companies for the past 18 consecutive years.[when?]
According to CNN Money, as of March 2011[update], Herman Miller was ranked as the second most admired company in the Home Equipment, Furnishing division. They also scored first in Innovation, People Management, Use of Corporate Assets, Social Responsibility, and Quality of Products/Services. In Quality of Management they scored second place, third in Long Term Investments, fourth in Financial Soundness, and ninth in Global Competitiveness.[6]
In March 2008, they settled an antitrust lawsuit with the states of New York, Michigan, and Illinois for $750,000.[7] The lawsuit focused on Herman Miller's use of a suggested retail pricing policy, which was found to be within the bounds of the law. Today, many companies employ such policies to avoid price erosion in the internet channel.
Sustainability[edit]
Herman Miller has engaged in a number of initiatives to promote sustainability, and many of them have had cost-saving implications for the company. The company has developed a technique of mixing sawdust with chicken manure to produce topsoil. The company also uses a database to track every chemical in each product used by the company, in order to eliminate harmful chemicals from their products. Management of the company has expressed concerns about global warming, and the company was using 27% renewable energy as of 2007[update]. The company also issues a sustainability report.[8]
Herman Miller's driving sustainability initiatives is its "Perfect Vision" goal. This is a broad initiative that sets significant targets for the year 2020. These targets include zero landfill disposal, zero hazardous waste generation, zero air emissions (VOCs), zero process water discharge, 100% green electrical energy use, company buildings constructed to a minimum LEED Silver certification, and 100% of sales from DfE-approved[clarification needed] products.[9]
Many of Herman Miller's products are designed to be ecologically sound, and many are good examples of ecodesign techniques for achieving sustainability include saving materials, energy efficient manufacturing, recycled content, and recyclable content, including design for disassembly. The design process also utilizes life cycle assessment.[citation needed]
Herman Miller helped fund the start of the United States Green Building Council, and hired architect William McDonough + Partners to design a factory incorporating green design principles.[10] The building is known as the "Greenhouse", and is an example of green building. The building won the following awards:

AIA Committee on the Environment Top Ten Environmental Buildings, 1997
Business Week/Architectural Record Good Design Is Good Business Award, 1997
AIA Central Virginia Honor Award, 1998
International Development Research Council, Award for Distinguished Service in Environmental Planning, 1995[11]

History[edit]




A typical distribution depot, in Chippenham, Wiltshire.


Herman Miller was founded in 1905 as the Star Furniture Co. in Zeeland, Michigan.[2] Initially the company produced high quality furniture, especially bedroom suites, in historic revival styles.[2] In 1909, Dirk Jan De Pree began working for the company as a clerk, and became its president by 1919, when it was renamed The Michigan Star Furniture Co.[2] De Pree and his father-in-law, Herman Miller, purchased 51% of the company stock in 1923 and renamed it the Herman Miller Furniture Company. It became Herman Miller, Inc. in 1960.[2]
Until 1930, the company produced only traditional wood furniture.[2] With the coming of the Great Depression the company was forced to explore new products to survive in a shrinking market[2] and reluctantly hired Gilbert Rohde, a designer who specialized in modernist designs.[2] Rohde turned the company in a totally new direction and in 1933, Herman Miller debuted a line of modern furniture at the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago, Illinois.[2] In 1941, the company opened a showroom in the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and another in New York City. Under Rohde's supervision Herman Miller entered the contract (office) furniture market in 1942, with the introduction of the "Modular Executive Office" Group (EOG), the first in a long line of office furnishings to be produced by the company.[2]
Rohde died in 1944 and was replaced by architect George Nelson, who joined the firm as director of design in 1945.[2] Over the next four decades Nelson was to have an enormous influence upon Herman Miller, not only for his personal design contributions, but also for the talented designers he recruited to its ranks, including; Isamu Noguchi, Charles and Ray Eames, Robert Propst, and textile designer Alexander Girard.[2] Beginning in the late 1940s, the period under Nelson's guidance saw Herman Miller produce some of the world's most iconic pieces of modern furniture, including the Noguchi table, Eames Lounge Chair, Marshmallow sofa, Ball clock (actually produced by Howard Miller Clock Company), and the Sling sofa.[2]
Dirk Jan De Pree continued to serve as Herman Miller CEO until 1961, when he was forced by illness to step down. He was succeeded by his son, Hugh De Pree. Hugh served as company CEO until the mid-1980s, when he was succeeded by his brother Max De Pree, who held the position until 1990.[2]
In 1961, Herman Miller set up the Herman Miller Research Division, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[2] This division developed the "Action Office" line in 1964 under the supervision of Robert Propst and with the design assistance of George Nelson's New York design studio,.[2] Though the initial line, known as "Action Office I", was not a success, it led Propst to develop the "Action Office II" line, which introduced the "Office cubicle".[2] The impact of Action Office II on the workplace revolutionized the office environment. In 1978, Action Office II was renamed simply "Action Office". Herman Miller's line of Action Office products generated sales of over $5 billion as of 1998[update].[2]
George Nelson's influence at Herman Miller gradually declined during the 1970s as new designers joined the company, including Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf, who co-designed the Equa chair (still widely marketed), and in the 1990s developed the highly-successful Aeron chair. In 1981, Herman Miller started to work with the Italian designer Clino T. Castelli on the process of designing physical environments: a so-called Design Primario[2][3] including CMF Design and Ethospace design concept.[4] Designer Tom Newhouse introduced the "Newhouse Group" of free-standing furniture in 1987, and assisted with the "Ethospace" wall panel system for the Action Office line. Ray Wilkes designed the "Modular Seating Group", popularly known as the Chicklet Chairs.[2]
Artist Stephen Frykholm is also noted for his contributions to Herman Miller. From 1970 to 1989, Frykholm produced a series of promotional posters for Herman Miller's annual summer picnics, some of which are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, and remain highly sought-after art prints.[2]
In July 2014, Herman Miller announced it had reached an agreement to purchase the contemporary retailer Design Within Reach (DWR) for $154 million, in a bid to establish itself as a “premier lifestyle brand”.[5]
Workplace[edit]
Herman Miller is consistently recognized as one of Fortune magazine's "Most Admired Companies", having placed at the top of the list for furniture companies for the past 18 consecutive years.[when?]
According to CNN Money, as of March 2011[update], Herman Miller was ranked as the second most admired company in the Home Equipment, Furnishing division. They also scored first in Innovation, People Management, Use of Corporate Assets, Social Responsibility, and Quality of Products/Services. In Quality of Management they scored second place, third in Long Term Investments, fourth in Financial Soundness, and ninth in Global Competitiveness.[6]
In March 2008, they settled an antitrust lawsuit with the states of New York, Michigan, and Illinois for $750,000.[7] The lawsuit focused on Herman Miller's use of a suggested retail pricing policy, which was found to be within the bounds of the law. Today, many companies employ such policies to avoid price erosion in the internet channel.
Sustainability[edit]
Herman Miller has engaged in a number of initiatives to promote sustainability, and many of them have had cost-saving implications for the company. The company has developed a technique of mixing sawdust with chicken manure to produce topsoil. The company also uses a database to track every chemical in each product used by the company, in order to eliminate harmful chemicals from their products. Management of the company has expressed concerns about global warming, and the company was using 27% renewable energy as of 2007[update]. The company also issues a sustainability report.[8]
Herman Miller's driving sustainability initiatives is its "Perfect Vision" goal. This is a broad initiative that sets significant targets for the year 2020. These targets include zero landfill disposal, zero hazardous waste generation, zero air emissions (VOCs), zero process water discharge, 100% green electrical energy use, company buildings constructed to a minimum LEED Silver certification, and 100% of sales from DfE-approved[clarification needed] products.[9]
Many of Herman Miller's products are designed to be ecologically sound, and many are good examples of ecodesign techniques for achieving sustainability include saving materials, energy efficient manufacturing, recycled content, and recyclable content, including design for disassembly. The design process also utilizes life cycle assessment.[citation needed]
Herman Miller helped fund the start of the United States Green Building Council, and hired architect William McDonough + Partners to design a factory incorporating green design principles.[10] The building is known as the "Greenhouse", and is an example of green building. The building won the following awards:

AIA Committee on the Environment Top Ten Environmental Buildings, 1997
Business Week/Architectural Record Good Design Is Good Business Award, 1997
AIA Central Virginia Honor Award, 1998
International Development Research Council, Award for Distinguished Service in Environmental Planning, 1995[11]

Castelli on the process of designing physical environments: a so-called Design Primario[2][3] including CMF Design and Ethospace design concept.[4] Designer Tom Newhouse introduced the "Newhouse Group" of free-standing furniture in 1987, and assisted with the "Ethospace" wall panel system for the Action Office line. Ray Wilkes designed the "Modular Seating Group", popularly known as the Chicklet Chairs.[2]
Artist Stephen Frykholm is also noted for his contributions to Herman Miller. From 1970 to 1989, Frykholm produced a series of promotional posters for Herman Miller's annual summer picnics, some of which are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, and remain highly sought-after art prints.[2]
In July 2014, Herman Miller announced it had reached an agreement to purchase the contemporary retailer Design Within Reach (DWR) for $154 million, in a bid to establish itself as a “premier lifestyle brand”.[5]
Workplace[edit]
Herman Miller is consistently recognized as one of Fortune magazine's "Most Admired Companies", having placed at the top of the list for furniture companies for the past 18 consecutive years.[when?]
According to CNN Money, as of March 2011[update], Herman Miller was ranked as the second most admired company in the Home Equipment, Furnishing division. They also scored first in Innovation, People Management, Use of Corporate Assets, Social Responsibility, and Quality of Products/Services. In Quality of Management they scored second place, third in Long Term Investments, fourth in Financial Soundness, and ninth in Global Competitiveness.[6]
In March 2008, they settled an antitrust lawsuit with the states of New York, Michigan, and Illinois for $750,000.[7] The lawsuit focused on Herman Miller's use of a suggested retail pricing policy, which was found to be within the bounds of the law. Today, many companies employ such policies to avoid price erosion in the internet channel.
Sustainability[edit]
Herman Miller has engaged in a number of initiatives to promote sustainability, and many of them have had cost-saving implications for the company. The company has developed a technique of mixing sawdust with chicken manure to produce topsoil. The company also uses a database to track every chemical in each product used by the company, in order to eliminate harmful chemicals from their products. Management of the company has expressed concerns about global warming, and the company was using 27% renewable energy as of 2007[update]. The company also issues a sustainability report.[8]
Herman Miller's driving sustainability initiatives is its "Perfect Vision" goal. This is a broad initiative that sets significant targets for the year 2020. These targets include zero landfill disposal, zero hazardous waste generation, zero air emissions (VOCs), zero process water discharge, 100% green electrical energy use, company buildings constructed to a minimum LEED Silver certification, and 100% of sales from DfE-approved[clarification needed] products.[9]
Many of Herman Miller's products are designed to be ecologically sound, and many are good examples of ecodesign techniques for achieving sustainability include saving materials, energy efficient manufacturing, recycled content, and recyclable content, including design for disassembly. The design process also utilizes life cycle assessment.[citation needed]
Herman Miller helped fund the start of the United States Green Building Council, and hired architect William McDonough + Partners to design a factory incorporating green design principles.[10] The building is known as the "Greenhouse", and is an example of green building. The building won the following awards:

AIA Committee on the Environment Top Ten Environmental Buildings, 1997
Business Week/Architectural Record Good Design Is Good Business Award, 1997
AIA Central Virginia Honor Award, 1998
International Development Research Council, Award for Distinguished Service in Environmental Planning, 1995[11]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the issues discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis in conjunction with the company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.  Executive Overview  More than 100 years of innovative business practices and a commitment to social responsibility have established Herman Miller as a recognized global company. A past recipient of the Smithsonian Institution's Cooper Hewitt National Design Award, Herman Miller designs can be found in the permanent collections of museums worldwide. Herman Miller maintains its listing in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index as well as the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's top rating in its annual Corporate Equality Index. The company trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol MLHR.  Herman Miller's products are sold internationally through wholly-owned subsidiaries or branches in various countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, India, Brazil and the Netherlands. The company's products are offered elsewhere in the world primarily through independent dealerships or joint ventures with customers in over 100 countries.  The company is globally positioned in terms of manufacturing operations. In the United States, manufacturing operations are located in Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. In Europe, its manufacturing presence is located within the United Kingdom. Manufacturing operations in Asia include facilities located in Dongguan and Ningbo, China and a new manufacturing facility in India opened this year. The company manufactures products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the Herman Miller Performance System (HMPS). Herman Miller strives to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand. Accordingly, production is order-driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand. The standard lead time for the majority of our products is 10 to 20 days. These factors result in a high rate of inventory turns related to our manufactured inventories.  A key element of the company's manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers. This strategy has allowed the company to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage. As a result of this strategy, our manufacturing operations are largely assembly-based.  The business is comprised of various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The operating segments are determined on the basis of how the company internally reports and evaluates financial information used to make operating decisions. The company has identified the following reportable segments:   North American Furniture Solutions - Includes the operations associated with the design, manufacture, and sale of furniture products for work-related settings, including office, education, and healthcare environments, throughout the United States and Canada. The North American Furniture Solutions reportable segment is the aggregation of two operating segments. In addition, the company has determined that both operating segments within the North American Furniture Solutions reportable segment represent reporting units.   ELA Furniture Solutions - ELA Furniture Solutions includes the operations associated with the design, manufacture, and sale of furniture products, primarily for work-related settings, in the EMEA, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific geographic regions.   Specialty - Includes the operations associated with design, manufacture, and sale of high-craft furniture products and textiles including Geiger wood products, Maharam textiles, and Herman Miller Collection products.   Consumer - Includes the operations associated with the sale of modern design furnishings and accessories to third party retail distributors, as well as direct to consumer sales through e-commerce, direct mailing catalogs, and DWR studios.  The company also reports a corporate category consisting primarily of unallocated corporate expenses including restructuring, impairment, acquisition-related costs, and other unallocated corporate costs.  - 17-  Core Strengths   Portfolio of Leading Brands - Herman Miller is a globally-recognized, authentic brand known for working with some of the most outstanding designers in the world. Within the industries in which the company operates, Herman Miller, DWR, Geiger, Maharam, POSH, Nemschoff and Colbrook Bosson Saunders ("CBS") are acknowledged as leading brands that inspire architects and designers to create their best design solutions. This portfolio has enabled Herman Miller to connect with new audiences, channels, geographies and product categories. Leveraging the company's brand equity across the lines of business is an important element of the company's business strategy.   Problem-Solving Design and Innovation - The company is committed to developing research-based functionality and aesthetically innovative new products and has a history of doing so, in collaboration with a global network of leading independent designers. The company believes its skills and experience in matching problem-solving design with the workplace needs of customers provides the company with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. An important component of the company's business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research, design, and development. The company accomplishes this through the use of an internal research and engineering staff that engages with third party design resources generally compensated on a royalty basis.   Operational Excellence - The company was among the first in our industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing. HMPS provides the foundation for all of our manufacturing operations. The company is committed to continuously improving both product quality and production and operational efficiency. The company has extended this lean process work to its non-manufacturing processes as well as externally to our manufacturing supply chain and distribution channel. The company believes these concepts hold significant promise for further gains in reliability, quality and efficiency.   Leading Networks - The company values relationships in all areas of the business. The company considers its network of innovative designers, owned and independent dealers, and suppliers to be among the most important competitive factors and vital to the long-term success of the business.   Multi-Channel Reach - The company has built a unique, multi-channel distribution capability that it considers unique. Through contract furniture dealers, direct customer sales, retail studios, e-Commerce, catalogs and independent retailers, the company serves contract and residential customers across a range of channels and geographies.  Channels of Distribution   Independent and Owned Contract Furniture Dealers - Most of the company's product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in many countries around the world. These dealers purchase the company's products and distribute them to end customers. The company recognizes revenue on product sales through this channel once products are shipped and title passes to the dealer. Many of these dealers also offer furniture-related services, including product installation.  At May 28, 2016, the company owned two contract furniture dealerships, one of which has operations in multiple locations. The financial results of these owned dealers are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as inter-company transactions from our consolidated financial results. The company recognizes revenue on these sales once products are shipped to the end customer and installation is substantially complete. The company believes independent ownership of contract furniture dealers is generally the best model for a financially strong distribution network. With this in mind, the company's strategy is to continue to pursue opportunities to transition the remaining owned dealerships to independent owners. Where possible, the goal is to involve local managers in these ownership transitions.   Direct Customer Sales - The company also sells products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary (e.g. sales to the U.S. federal government). In most of these instances, the company contracts separately with a dealership or third-party installation company to provide sales-related services. The company recognizes revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete.   DWR Retail Studios - At the end of fiscal 2016, DWR had 29 retail studios and two outlet locations located in metropolitan areas throughout North America. Revenue on sales from these studios is recognized upon delivery to the end customer.  - 18-   E-Commerce - The company sells products through its online stores, in which products are available for sale via the company's website, hermanmiller.com as well as through the DWR online store, dwr.com. These sites complement our existing methods of distribution and extend the company's brand to new customers. The company recognizes revenue on these sales either upon shipment of the product, or for sales through the DWR online store, upon product delivery to the end customer.   DWR Direct-Mail Catalogs - The company's consumer business unit utilizes a direct-mail catalog program through its DWR subsidiary. A regular schedule of catalog mailings is maintained throughout the fiscal year and these serve as a key driver of sales across each of DWR's channels, including retail studios and e-commerce websites. Revenue on sales transacted through this catalog program is recognized upon product delivery to the end customer.   Independent Retailers - Certain products are sold to end customers through independent retail operations. Revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer.  Challenges Ahead  Avenues of Future Growth   Globalization & Demographics - Demographic shifts in the global workforce are significantly changing how and where value creation happens. Not only has the millennial generation overtaken the majority representation of the workforce, but economies that once relied on industrial production are increasingly becoming driven by knowledge work.   Inherently Global & Seamlessly Digital - The ubiquity of technology allows people to connect with other people, content, work, businesses, and ideas wherever and whenever they want. This means the way people work is changing, where people work is changing, and how people work with each other is changing.   The Era of Ideas - With the ongoing optimization of industrial production and information sharing, the demand for more innovative business solutions increases. The global focus of work is shifting to the successful generation and deployment of new ideas. As creativity and idea generation drive greater value - people, not process, provide the distinguishing capability. In this shift, workplaces are fundamentally changing from standardized and process-driven designs to diverse places that harness human capability, creativity, and relationships.  Over the past several years, Herman Miller has deployed a strategy to grow the business by shifting its focus in four fundamental areas in response to these changes. Through these shifts the company believes it is positioned to take advantage of existing markets, explore growth opportunities in new markets with supportive demographics, increase demand by addressing unmet needs, and expand into areas that yield higher prospects for margins and profitability. The four fundamental shifts are described below:   From Product Centric to Solutions - The first strategic shift is to move from a product centric focus to one based upon delivering broader solutions to customers. Herman Miller is retooling its core business to speak to customers with fresh insights, to spur new demand, and to change the game with unique solutions and services.   From North America Centric to Global - The second shift in our strategy aims to transform the business into a truly global organization. Herman Miller has a solid existing customer base, but sees meaningful opportunity in emerging markets with supportive demographics. The company is positioning itself to take maximum advantage of these shifts.   From The Office to Everywhere - The third fundamental strategic shift is moving from the office to everywhere. Herman Miller envisions continued leadership and viability in the contract furniture industry, but also sees distinct targeted opportunities through focused market segmentation. The company envisions a total offering for customers to enable "a lifestyle of purpose."  - 19-   From Industry brand to Industry + Consumer brand - The fourth shift in strategy involves the company's ambition to expand the connection of its powerful brand more directly with the consumers of its products. With a legacy of decades of design leadership, Herman Miller is a brand that people desire and want to know. The company envisions a business that harnesses its brand vision to pull consumers to it.  This year the company has added one additional shift - product marketing to pull marketing - that it believes is required in order to reach the full velocity of its intended transformation. In other words, the company believes that this additional shift will put its strategy into Overdrive, which is what the strategy has been named.  Herman Miller intends to grow in targeted ways. First, the company will invest in areas that increase its existing markets across focused customer segments (such as healthcare, education, small and medium business, and consumer). Second, it will expand into emerging geographic markets that offer growth potential based upon their supportive demographics. Third, it will continue to invest in innovative products, which has been a hallmark of its success for many years. Finally, the company will grow through targeted acquisitions.  Industry Analysis  The company analyzes BIFMA statistical information as a benchmark comparison against the performance of its contract business in North America and also to that of its competitors. The timing of large project-based business may affect comparisons to this data in any one period. Finally, BIFMA regularly provides its members with industry forecast information, which the company uses internally as one of several considerations in its short and long-range planning process.  After many years of compiling and reporting member production data for the U.S. market, BIFMA is revising its data collection process in an attempt to better reflect contract furniture production throughout North America, including products manufactured in Canada and Mexico. Prior to this change, products manufactured in Canada or Mexico and shipped to the U.S. were excluded from BIFMA's estimate of industry shipments and orders. The new methodology is designed to provide a better reflection of the market as a whole, especially given the rise in competition based in Canada and Mexico as well as sourcing moves by the company's existing competitors. Additionally, BIFMA has revised its product definitions to better fit products specifically designed for the Healthcare and Education end markets. The net effect of this is that the estimated market size for the North American contract industry will increase substantially - resulting in a re-orientation of market share estimates across each industry participant. However, any BIFMA statistics that are mentioned throughout this document are based on the historical method of compiling the industry data and the company anticipates disclosure of BIFMA statistical data under the new method in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  The company also monitors trade statistics reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, which reports monthly retail sales growth data across a number of retail categories, including Furniture and Home Furnishing Stores. This information provides a relative comparison to our Consumer reportable segment.  Looking forward, the general economic outlook for our industry in the North America is expected to be positive. BIFMA issued its most recent report in February 2016, which forecasts that the growth rate of office furniture orders will be 3.1 percent and 4.4 percent in calendar 2016 and 2017, respectively, while the growth rate of shipments will be 1.0 percent and 4.8 percent for calendar 2016 and 2017, respectively. This forecast of growth is based primarily on employment gains in the U.S., tempered by the current global economic uncertainty.  - 20-  Discussion of Business Conditions  The growth in sales and earnings during fiscal 2016 brought with it increased cash generation. As of the end of fiscal 2016, total cash and cash equivalents of $84.9 million represented an increase of $21.2 million from fiscal 2015. Cash flows from operations in the period were $210.4 million, which represented an increase of 25.5 percent from fiscal 2015.  The North American segment contributed significantly to our growth in net sales, orders, and earnings during fiscal 2016. Net sales for the segment grew at a rate of 7.2 percent and orders increased by 8.1 percent as compared to fiscal 2015. Organic net sales growth for the year was 8.2 percent (1) and orders increased 9.0 percent, while operating earnings increased 21.4 percent to $152.0 million during fiscal 2016. We believe this improvement demonstrates the impact of our investments over the past year in new products, refreshed showrooms and a solutions-based selling approach that provides our customers with problem solving designs.  In spite of the negative impact of foreign currency translation, the ELA segment posted growth in net sales (0.7 percent) and operating earnings (36.3 percent) as compared to the prior year, while orders for the period decreased by 0.1 percent. On a constant currency basis relative to fiscal 2015, net sales growth for the year was 7.0 percent (1) and orders increased 6.2 percent. During fiscal 2016, a new manufacturing and distribution facility was opened in the United Kingdom, which has bolstered operational efficiency. Assembly operations were also launched in India, significantly expanding our ability to service customers in this growing market. Finally, the Asia-Pacific region has benefited from renewed momentum of the POSH brand, which delivered sales growth and improved profitability throughout the year.  Our Specialty segment also showed growth as compared to the prior year. Sales increased 5.4 percent compared to fiscal 2015, driven mainly by improved sales volumes related to Geiger wood products and the Herman Miller Collection. Operating earnings increased $2.9 million from fiscal 2015. Increased sales volumes, decreases in material costs and improved operational efficiencies had a favorable impact on operating earnings for the Specialty segment.  The Consumer segment saw an increase in net sales of $18.2 million in the current fiscal year as compared to fiscal 2015. An increase of $30.2 million was driven by the fact that 52 weeks of DWR results were included in our consolidated results for fiscal 2016 as compared to 44 weeks in fiscal 2015. Sales were adversely impacted primarily by the following factors:   Continued impact from closing smaller legacy DWR studio locations as we look to transition into larger format studios.   Interruptions in selling activity resulting from the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system at DWR, during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.   Continued impact from the deliberate reduction in the number of independent retail distributors within our legacy consumer wholesale business.  While the current year results for the Consumer segment did not meet our expectations, we believe the value drivers within the Consumer segment remain intact to drive future growth. These drivers include the transition of DWR studios to larger, more efficient formats, and increasing the breadth of the product portfolio, particularly in the area of exclusive product designs.  The economic backdrop of our businesses was mixed globally. North America continued to benefit from strong employment and encouraging construction and architectural billings data. Commodity costs, particularly that of steel, remained relatively low throughout fiscal 2016 though in recent months has been steadily increasing. Outside of North America, we are closely monitoring commodity-driven economies that are currently (or are expected to experience) slower growth in the future. In addition, growing uncertainty over the impact of a United Kingdom exit from the European Union is an area of concern for our business in that important market.  (1) Non-GAAP measurements; see accompanying reconciliations and explanations.  - 21-  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Expenses associated with acquisition-related inventory adjustments   Transaction expenses associated with recent acquisitions   Non-cash impairment expenses   Non-recurring gains related to the sale of property and dealers, and   Impact of non-recurring tax items  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding depreciation, amortization and other net income or expense from Adjusted Operating Earnings. Organic sales represents the change in Net sales, excluding currency translation effects and the impact of acquisitions. We present the adjusted financial measures because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe them to be useful in analyzing ongoing results from operations.  The Adjusted financial measures are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to Gross margin, Operating expenses, Operating earnings (loss) and Earnings (loss) per share - diluted under GAAP. The Adjusted financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of the Adjusted financial measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items. We compensate for these limitations by providing prominence of our GAAP results and using the Adjusted financial measures only as a supplement.  The following table reconciles Net sales to Organic net sales for the years and reportable operating segments indicated.  . . .  Jul 26, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

Herman Miller Eames Collection










 





Internationally recognized as one of the more prominent names within the design industry, the Eames name is synonymous with the concept of modern design. At the price of producing reliably exceptional pieces across the board, Herman Miller's Eames Collection consistently stands at the forefront of great design with numerous other iconic and timeless classics. Pieces that carry the Eames name range from lounge, to dining, to workspace, and to accessories; each with a grounded history in mid-century modernism and each consistently produced with remarkably high quality that hasnt wavered since its initial production.After meeting while attending Cranbrook Academy of Art and subsequently marrying in 1941, Charles and Ray Eames' working partnership aimed to create multifunctional designs since the beginning. Initially started as an experimental collaborative effort between Charles Eames and Eero Sararinen, steps taken to manipulate and mold plywood into strong, flexible products proved difficult and would eventually lead the couple to constructing a special machine specifically for this capability. Since successfully improving their technological process with molding plywood, the Eames applied their newfound capability to designing and producing domestic furniture pieces under Herman Miller. In no time, the couple progressed with employing their technique to other materials like aluminum, fiberglass, and plastic as they expanded their line to include dining chairs, tables, storage units, lounge seating, office seating, and desks. Many of the Eames furniture pieces remain trendy to this day while being used across residential and commercial settings. The familiar silhouette of the Eames Lounge Chairs, the Eames Walnut Stools, the Eames Molded Chairs, or any number of their loved items, stays true to quality and enduring design with furnishing pieces that outlast cycling design trends while setting the standard.

Herman Miller, Inc., based in Zeeland, Michigan, is a major American manufacturer of office furniture, equipment and home furnishings. It is notable as one of the first companies to produce modern furniture and, under the guidance of Design Director George Nelson, is likely the most prolific and influential producer of furniture of the modernist style. Among classic Herman Miller products are the Equa chair, Aeron chair, Noguchi table, Marshmallow sofa, and the Eames Lounge Chair. Herman Miller is credited with the invention of the office cubicle (originally known as the "Action Office II") in 1968 under then-director of research Robert Propst.[1][2] Herman Miller holds a unique position among furniture manufacturers for having cultivated the talents of a large number of modernist designers, producing a significant number of pieces that are now considered icons of industrial design.

History[edit]




A typical distribution depot, in Chippenham, Wiltshire.


Herman Miller was founded in 1905 as the Star Furniture Co. in Zeeland, Michigan.[2] Initially the company produced high quality furniture, especially bedroom suites, in historic revival styles.[2] In 1909, Dirk Jan De Pree began working for the company as a clerk, and became its president by 1919, when it was renamed The Michigan Star Furniture Co.[2] De Pree and his father-in-law, Herman Miller, purchased 51% of the company stock in 1923 and renamed it the Herman Miller Furniture Company. It became Herman Miller, Inc. in 1960.[2]
Until 1930, the company produced only traditional wood furniture.[2] With the coming of the Great Depression the company was forced to explore new products to survive in a shrinking market[2] and reluctantly hired Gilbert Rohde, a designer who specialized in modernist designs.[2] Rohde turned the company in a totally new direction and in 1933, Herman Miller debuted a line of modern furniture at the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago, Illinois.[2] In 1941, the company opened a showroom in the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and another in New York City. Under Rohde's supervision Herman Miller entered the contract (office) furniture market in 1942, with the introduction of the "Modular Executive Office" Group (EOG), the first in a long line of office furnishings to be produced by the company.[2]
Rohde died in 1944 and was replaced by architect George Nelson, who joined the firm as director of design in 1945.[2] Over the next four decades Nelson was to have an enormous influence upon Herman Miller, not only for his personal design contributions, but also for the talented designers he recruited to its ranks, including; Isamu Noguchi, Charles and Ray Eames, Robert Propst, and textile designer Alexander Girard.[2] Beginning in the late 1940s, the period under Nelson's guidance saw Herman Miller produce some of the world's most iconic pieces of modern furniture, including the Noguchi table, Eames Lounge Chair, Marshmallow sofa, Ball clock (actually produced by Howard Miller Clock Company), and the Sling sofa.[2]
Dirk Jan De Pree continued to serve as Herman Miller CEO until 1961, when he was forced by illness to step down. He was succeeded by his son, Hugh De Pree. Hugh served as company CEO until the mid-1980s, when he was succeeded by his brother Max De Pree, who held the position until 1990.[2]
In 1961, Herman Miller set up the Herman Miller Research Division, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[2] This division developed the "Action Office" line in 1964 under the supervision of Robert Propst and with the design assistance of George Nelson's New York design studio,.[2] Though the initial line, known as "Action Office I", was not a success, it led Propst to develop the "Action Office II" line, which introduced the "Office cubicle".[2] The impact of Action Office II on the workplace revolutionized the office environment. In 1978, Action Office II was renamed simply "Action Office". Herman Miller's line of Action Office products generated sales of over $5 billion as of 1998[update].[2]
George Nelson's influence at Herman Miller gradually declined during the 1970s as new designers joined the company, including Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf, who co-designed the Equa chair (still widely marketed), and in the 1990s developed the highly-successful Aeron chair. In 1981, Herman Miller started to work with the Italian designer Clino T. Castelli on the process of designing physical environments: a so-called Design Primario[2][3] including CMF Design and Ethospace design concept.[4] Designer Tom Newhouse introduced the "Newhouse Group" of free-standing furniture in 1987, and assisted with the "Ethospace" wall panel system for the Action Office line. Ray Wilkes designed the "Modular Seating Group", popularly known as the Chicklet Chairs.[2]
Artist Stephen Frykholm is also noted for his contributions to Herman Miller. From 1970 to 1989, Frykholm produced a series of promotional posters for Herman Miller's annual summer picnics, some of which are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, and remain highly sought-after art prints.[2]
In July 2014, Herman Miller announced it had reached an agreement to purchase the contemporary retailer Design Within Reach (DWR) for $154 million, in a bid to establish itself as a “premier lifestyle brand”.[5]
Workplace[edit]
Herman Miller is consistently recognized as one of Fortune magazine's "Most Admired Companies", having placed at the top of the list for furniture companies for the past 18 consecutive years.[when?]
According to CNN Money, as of March 2011[update], Herman Miller was ranked as the second most admired company in the Home Equipment, Furnishing division. They also scored first in Innovation, People Management, Use of Corporate Assets, Social Responsibility, and Quality of Products/Services. In Quality of Management they scored second place, third in Long Term Investments, fourth in Financial Soundness, and ninth in Global Competitiveness.[6]
In March 2008, they settled an antitrust lawsuit with the states of New York, Michigan, and Illinois for $750,000.[7] The lawsuit focused on Herman Miller's use of a suggested retail pricing policy, which was found to be within the bounds of the law. Today, many companies employ such policies to avoid price erosion in the internet channel.
Sustainability[edit]
Herman Miller has engaged in a number of initiatives to promote sustainability, and many of them have had cost-saving implications for the company. The company has developed a technique of mixing sawdust with chicken manure to produce topsoil. The company also uses a database to track every chemical in each product used by the company, in order to eliminate harmful chemicals from their products. Management of the company has expressed concerns about global warming, and the company was using 27% renewable energy as of 2007[update]. The company also issues a sustainability report.[8]
Herman Miller's driving sustainability initiatives is its "Perfect Vision" goal. This is a broad initiative that sets significant targets for the year 2020. These targets include zero landfill disposal, zero hazardous waste generation, zero air emissions (VOCs), zero process water discharge, 100% green electrical energy use, company buildings constructed to a minimum LEED Silver certification, and 100% of sales from DfE-approved[clarification needed] products.[9]
Many of Herman Miller's products are designed to be ecologically sound, and many are good examples of ecodesign techniques for achieving sustainability include saving materials, energy efficient manufacturing, recycled content, and recyclable content, including design for disassembly. The design process also utilizes life cycle assessment.[citation needed]
Herman Miller helped fund the start of the United States Green Building Council, and hired architect William McDonough + Partners to design a factory incorporating green design principles.[10] The building is known as the "Greenhouse", and is an example of green building. The building won the following awards:

AIA Committee on the Environment Top Ten Environmental Buildings, 1997
Business Week/Architectural Record Good Design Is Good Business Award, 1997
AIA Central Virginia Honor Award, 1998
International Development Research Council, Award for Distinguished Service in Environmental Planning, 1995[11]

The company has developed a technique of mixing sawdust with chicken manure to produce topsoil. The company also uses a database to track every chemical in each product used by the company, in order to eliminate harmful chemicals from their products. Management of the company has expressed concerns about global warming, and the company was using 27% renewable energy as of 2007[update]. The company also issues a sustainability report.[8]
Herman Miller's driving sustainability initiatives is its "Perfect Vision" goal. This is a broad initiative that sets significant targets for the year 2020. These targets include zero landfill disposal, zero hazardous waste generation, zero air emissions (VOCs), zero process water discharge, 100% green electrical energy use, company buildings constructed to a minimum LEED Silver certification, and 100% of sales from DfE-approved[clarification needed] products.[9]
Many of Herman Miller's products are designed to be ecologically sound, and many are good examples of ecodesign techniques for achieving sustainability include saving materials, energy efficient manufacturing, recycled content, and recyclable content, including design for disassembly. The design process also utilizes life cycle assessment.[citation needed]
Herman Miller helped fund the start of the United States Green Building Council, and hired architect William McDonough + Partners to design a factory incorporating green design principles.[10] The building is known as the "Greenhouse", and is an example of green building. The building won the following awards:

AIA Committee on the Environment Top Ten Environmental Buildings, 1997
Business Week/Architectural Record Good Design Is Good Business Award, 1997
AIA Central Virginia Honor Award, 1998
International Development Research Council, Award for Distinguished Service in Environmental Planning, 1995[11]

Herman Miller, Inc., based in Zeeland, Michigan, is a major American manufacturer of office furniture, equipment and home furnishings. It is notable as one of the first companies to produce modern furniture and, under the guidance of Design Director George Nelson, is likely the most prolific and influential producer of furniture of the modernist style. Among classic Herman Miller products are the Equa chair, Aeron chair, Noguchi table, Marshmallow sofa, and the Eames Lounge Chair. Herman Miller is credited with the invention of the office cubicle (originally known as the "Action Office II") in 1968 under then-director of research Robert Propst.[1][2] Herman Miller holds a unique position among furniture manufacturers for having cultivated the talents of a large number of modernist designers, producing a significant number of pieces that are now considered icons of industrial design.

History[edit]




A typical distribution depot, in Chippenham, Wiltshire.


Herman Miller was founded in 1905 as the Star Furniture Co. in Zeeland, Michigan.[2] Initially the company produced high quality furniture, especially bedroom suites, in historic revival styles.[2] In 1909, Dirk Jan De Pree began working for the company as a clerk, and became its president by 1919, when it was renamed The Michigan Star Furniture Co.[2] De Pree and his father-in-law, Herman Miller, purchased 51% of the company stock in 1923 and renamed it the Herman Miller Furniture Company. It became Herman Miller, Inc. in 1960.[2]
Until 1930, the company produced only traditional wood furniture.[2] With the coming of the Great Depression the company was forced to explore new products to survive in a shrinking market[2] and reluctantly hired Gilbert Rohde, a designer who specialized in modernist designs.[2] Rohde turned the company in a totally new direction and in 1933, Herman Miller debuted a line of modern furniture at the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago, Illinois.[2] In 1941, the company opened a showroom in the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and another in New York City. Under Rohde's supervision Herman Miller entered the contract (office) furniture market in 1942, with the introduction of the "Modular Executive Office" Group (EOG), the first in a long line of office furnishings to be produced by the company.[2]
Rohde died in 1944 and was replaced by architect George Nelson, who joined the firm as director of design in 1945.[2] Over the next four decades Nelson was to have an enormous influence upon Herman Miller, not only for his personal design contributions, but also for the talented designers he recruited to its ranks, including; Isamu Noguchi, Charles and Ray Eames, Robert Propst, and textile designer Alexander Girard.[2] Beginning in the late 1940s, the period under Nelson's guidance saw Herman Miller produce some of the world's most iconic pieces of modern furniture, including the Noguchi table, Eames Lounge Chair, Marshmallow sofa, Ball clock (actually produced by Howard Miller Clock Company), and the Sling sofa.[2]
Dirk Jan De Pree continued to serve as Herman Miller CEO until 1961, when he was forced by illness to step down. He was succeeded by his son, Hugh De Pree. Hugh served as company CEO until the mid-1980s, when he was succeeded by his brother Max De Pree, who held the position until 1990.[2]
In 1961, Herman Miller set up the Herman Miller Research Division, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[2] This division developed the "Action Office" line in 1964 under the supervision of Robert Propst and with the design assistance of George Nelson's New York design studio,.[2] Though the initial line, known as "Action Office I", was not a success, it led Propst to develop the "Action Office II" line, which introduced the "Office cubicle".[2] The impact of Action Office II on the workplace revolutionized the office environment. In 1978, Action Office II was renamed simply "Action Office". Herman Miller's line of Action Office products generated sales of over $5 billion as of 1998[update].[2]
George Nelson's influence at Herman Miller gradually declined during the 1970s as new designers joined the company, including Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf, who co-designed the Equa chair (still widely marketed), and in the 1990s developed the highly-successful Aeron chair. In 1981, Herman Miller started to work with the Italian designer Clino T. Castelli on the process of designing physical environments: a so-called Design Primario[2][3] including CMF Design and Ethospace design concept.[4] Designer Tom Newhouse introduced the "Newhouse Group" of free-standing furniture in 1987, and assisted with the "Ethospace" wall panel system for the Action Office line. Ray Wilkes designed the "Modular Seating Group", popularly known as the Chicklet Chairs.[2]
Artist Stephen Frykholm is also noted for his contributions to Herman Miller. From 1970 to 1989, Frykholm produced a series of promotional posters for Herman Miller's annual summer picnics, some of which are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, and remain highly sought-after art prints.[2]
In July 2014, Herman Miller announced it had reached an agreement to purchase the contemporary retailer Design Within Reach (DWR) for $154 million, in a bid to establish itself as a “premier lifestyle brand”.[5]
Workplace[edit]
Herman Miller is consistently recognized as one of Fortune magazine's "Most Admired Companies", having placed at the top of the list for furniture companies for the past 18 consecutive years.[when?]
According to CNN Money, as of March 2011[update], Herman Miller was ranked as the second most admired company in the Home Equipment, Furnishing division. They also scored first in Innovation, People Management, Use of Corporate Assets, Social Responsibility, and Quality of Products/Services. In Quality of Management they scored second place, third in Long Term Investments, fourth in Financial Soundness, and ninth in Global Competitiveness.[6]
In March 2008, they settled an antitrust lawsuit with the states of New York, Michigan, and Illinois for $750,000.[7] The lawsuit focused on Herman Miller's use of a suggested retail pricing policy, which was found to be within the bounds of the law. Today, many companies employ such policies to avoid price erosion in the internet channel.
Sustainability[edit]
Herman Miller has engaged in a number of initiatives to promote sustainability, and many of them have had cost-saving implications for the company. The company has developed a technique of mixing sawdust with chicken manure to produce topsoil. The company also uses a database to track every chemical in each product used by the company, in order to eliminate harmful chemicals from their products. Management of the company has expressed concerns about global warming, and the company was using 27% renewable energy as of 2007[update]. The company also issues a sustainability report.[8]
Herman Miller's driving sustainability initiatives is its "Perfect Vision" goal. This is a broad initiative that sets significant targets for the year 2020. These targets include zero landfill disposal, zero hazardous waste generation, zero air emissions (VOCs), zero process water discharge, 100% green electrical energy use, company buildings constructed to a minimum LEED Silver certification, and 100% of sales from DfE-approved[clarification needed] products.[9]
Many of Herman Miller's products are designed to be ecologically sound, and many are good examples of ecodesign techniques for achieving sustainability include saving materials, energy efficient manufacturing, recycled content, and recyclable content, including design for disassembly. The design process also utilizes life cycle assessment.[citation needed]
Herman Miller helped fund the start of the United States Green Building Council, and hired architect William McDonough + Partners to design a factory incorporating green design principles.[10] The building is known as the "Greenhouse", and is an example of green building. The building won the following awards:

AIA Committee on the Environment Top Ten Environmental Buildings, 1997
Business Week/Architectural Record Good Design Is Good Business Award, 1997
AIA Central Virginia Honor Award, 1998
International Development Research Council, Award for Distinguished Service in Environmental Planning, 1995[11]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
