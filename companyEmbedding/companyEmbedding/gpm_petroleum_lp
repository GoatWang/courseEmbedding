First Day Return: 
Return from IPO: 

Industry: Energy











We are a growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership formed by GPM to engage in the wholesale distribution of motor fuels on a fixed fee per gallon basis to GPM-controlled convenience stores and third parties. We commenced operations on January 12, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, GPM, the seventh largest convenience store chain in the United States ranked by store count, controlled 805 convenience stores that sell motor fuel, merchandise, food, beverages and other products and services to retail customers in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeastern, Midwestern and Northeastern United States. GPM is obligated to purchase all of its motor fuel from us under 10-year wholesale motor fuel distribution agreements. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, we distributed approximately 180.0 million and 660.8 million gallons of motor fuel, respectively, to GPM-controlled sites and 1.4 million and 6.3 million gallons of motor fuel, respectively, to third-party customers. We believe we are one of the largest independent motor fuel distributors by number of convenience stores in the United States, the largest distributor of Valero-branded motor fuel on the East Coast and the third largest distributor of Valero-branded motor fuel in the United States. In addition, we receive rental income from real estate that we own and lease to third parties.

Mergers & Acquisitions News
New MLP to Emerge Through GPM IPONew entity will supply fuel to more than 500 c-stores; proceeds will pay for Road RangerBy 

Steve Holtz,
Editor in Chief, CSP Daily News


Greg Lindenberg,
Editor, CSP










April 20, 2015
RICHMOND, Va. -- GPM Petroleum LP, which distributes motor fuel to
GPM Investments' convenience stores, will be the next master limited partnership (MLP) in the industry pending review of an initial public offering (IPO) filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).The SEC has 30 days to review the filing, in which GPM Petroleum, a spinoff from GPM Investments, is seeking an estimated $100 million from the stock sale.As reported in a 21st Century Smoke/CSP Daily News Flash, the company is applying for a listing of its common units on the NYSE under the symbol “GPMP.”GPM will use the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings that financed the acquisition in December 2014 of 43 Road Ranger convenience stores, and for general partnership purposes, including working capital or pre-funding capital expenditures.GPM Petroleum's agreements with GPM Investments include:A fuel distribution agreement, pursuant to which it will distribute the substantial majority of motor fuel purchased by GPM for sale to its existing convenience stores (other than convenience stores for which it is the distributor of motor fuel under the GPM RR Distribution Contract, a 10-year wholesale motor fuel distribution agreement substantially similar to the GPM Distribution Contract, pursuant to which it will distribute motor fuel to convenience stores acquired by GPM in the Road Ranger acquisition at cost plus a fixed fee of 4.5 cents per gallon for a period of 10 years), independent and lessee dealers and consignment locations at cost, plus a fixed fee of 4.5 cents per gallon for a period of 10 years, in addition to future volumes added pursuant to the terms of the omnibus agreement, referred to as the GPM Distribution Contract.The omnibus agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, it will receive a 10-year right of first offer to purchase the right to distribute fuel to GPM Investments for newly acquired convenience stores at a negotiated rate; and a 10-year right to participate in acquisitions with GPM.GPM Petroleum said it anticipates expanding "by either purchasing the right to provide wholesale motor fuel to convenience stores that may be acquired by GPM or jointly consummating acquisitions with GPM, as well as by directly acquiring wholesale motor fuel businesses with existing dealer operations. Through GPM’s expansion, we plan to further develop our wholesale motor fuel distribution both within our existing area of operations and in new geographic areas."It added, "GPM has considerable opportunity to serve as a consolidator in [the c-store] industry. … As GPM continues to make acquisitions, we will have the right, under the right of first offer contained in the omnibus agreement, to purchase distribution rights to any new locations GPM acquires."Many MLPs in the energy sector derive income from the wholesale distribution of refined products to convenience stores. They may also own real estate and collect rent; however, income from c-store retail operations, including the sale of fuel to consumers, is not qualified MLP income under the tax code.GPM is in a quiet period and cannot comment on the deal, a company spokesperson told CSP Daily News.Raymond James & Associates, St. Petersburg, Fla., is the financial lead for GPM in the IPO filing.As of April 15, 2015, Richmond, Va.-based GPM Investments controlled more than 500 convenience stores under various brand names including
Fas Mart and Shore Stop that sell motor fuel, merchandise, food, beverages and other products and services to retail customers in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeastern, Midwestern and Northeastern United States.GPM Investments distributed volumes it purchased from GPM Petroleum to more than 500 convenience stores controlled by GPM, more than 35 sites operated by independent dealers, more than 20 sites owned or leased by GPM and operated by lessee dealers and more than 40 consignment locations where GPM sells motor fuel to retail customers.Along with Fas Mart and Shore Stop, GPM convenience store brands include Scotchman Stores, Young's, Li'l Cricket, BreadBox and One Stop.Upon the completion of this offering, GPM Investments will purchase the majority of its motor fuel from GPM Petroleum. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2014, on a pro forma basis, GPM Petroleum distributed 461.7 million gallons of motor fuel to GPM-controlled convenience stores and 68.7 million gallons of motor fuel to third-party customers. Its wholesale motor fuels distribution now spans 13 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

We intend to use the estimated net proceeds of approximately $     million from
this offering, based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $     per
common unit (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus), after deducting underwriting discounts, the structuring fee of
$     million paid to Raymond James and offering expenses, together with $    
million of borrowings under our new revolving credit facility (which we expect
to borrow within 45 days of the closing of this offering):

• to repay borrowings of approximately $24.1 million assumed by us under two 
  affiliate loans entered into by our predecessor, which were used to finance
  the Road Ranger Acquisition;                                               

• to purchase approximately $     million of U.S. Treasury or other investment 
  grade securities, which will be assigned as collateral to secure our new 
  $     million term loan, the proceeds of which will be distributed to, and for
  which a guarantee of collection will be provided by, GPM;      

• to purchase approximately $35.1 million of U.S. Treasury or other investment 
  grade securities, which will be assigned as collateral to secure $35.1 million
  of the PNC term loan, which we will assume from GPM and for which GPM will 
  provide a guarantee; and                                    

• to repay approximately $     million of trade payables assumed by us in    
  connection with our formation transactions.                                

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, the number of additional common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the
remainder of the additional common units, if any, will be issued to GPM or a
wholly owned subsidiary of GPM. Any such units issued to GPM or a wholly owned
subsidiary of GPM will be issued for no additional consideration. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase        additional common units in
full, the additional net proceeds would be approximately $     million, (based
upon the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus), after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The
net proceeds received in connection with any exercise of such option will be
used to purchase a corresponding amount of additional U.S. Treasury or other
investment grade securities, which will be used for general partnership purposes
and may be used temporarily to collateralize our new term loan. In addition, we
will borrow under our new term loan an amount equal to the net proceeds received
upon exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units in
excess of $     million and use the proceeds of such loan to make a distribution
to GPM. GPM will provide a guarantee of collection with respect to such
borrowing. If the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, we will issue common units to GPM or a wholly owned
subsidiary of GPM upon the option’s expiration. Accordingly, the exercise of the
underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of common units
outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly
distribution on all units.

In March 2015, a portion of the consideration for the Road Ranger Acquisition
was financed in part with a $18.1 million loan with ARKO Holdings, Ltd. (“ARKO”)
and a $6.0 million loan with GPM Holdings, Inc. (“GPM Holdings”). These loans
mature in September 2016 and bear interest at 13.5% per annum, payable monthly.
At the closing of this offering, we expect to assume these loans and to repay
the amounts outstanding in full with the proceeds of this offering.

A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$     per common unit would cause the net proceeds from this offering, after
deducting the estimated underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by
us, to increase or decrease, respectively, by approximately $     million. In
addition, we may also increase or decrease the number of common units we are
offering. Each increase of 1.0 million common units offered by us, together with
a concomitant $1.00 increase in the assumed initial public offering price to
$     per common unit, would increase net proceeds to us from this offering by
approximately $     million. Similarly, each decrease of 1.0 million common
units offered by us, together with a concomitant $1.00 decrease in the assumed
initial public offering price to $     per common unit, would decrease the net
proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $     million. If we increase
or decrease the number of common units offered, we will increase or decrease,
respectively, the amount of funds retained for general partnership purposes. We
may concomitantly increase or reduce, as applicable, the amount of indebtedness
we will pay down. As a result, cash available for distribution per unit is
expected to remain unchanged regardless of the changes in the number of common
units offered.


We compete primarily with other independent motor fuel distributors. The market
for distribution of wholesale motor fuel is highly competitive and fragmented,
which results in narrow margins. We have numerous competitors, some of which may
have significantly greater resources and name recognition than we do. We rely on
our ability to provide value-added and reliable service and to control our
operating costs in order to maintain our competitive position.


Company Description
We are a growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership formed by GPM to engage in
the wholesale distribution of motor fuels on a fixed fee per gallon basis to
GPM-controlled convenience stores and third parties. As of June 30, 2015, GPM
controlled over 620 convenience stores that sell motor fuel,


 merchandise, food,
beverages and other products and services to retail customers in the
Mid-Atlantic, Southeastern, Midwestern and Northeastern United States. Upon the
completion of this offering, GPM will purchase all of its motor fuel from us.
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2015, on a pro forma basis, we distributed
572.4 million gallons of motor fuel to GPM-controlled convenience stores and
66.6 million gallons of motor fuel to third-party customers. We believe we are
one of the largest independent motor fuel distributors by number of convenience
stores in the United States, the largest distributor of Valero-branded motor
fuel on the East Coast and the third largest distributor of Valero-branded motor
fuel in the United States. In addition, we receive rental income from real
estate that we own and lease to third parties.

Our primary business objective is to make stable quarterly cash distributions to
our unitholders and, over time, to increase our quarterly cash distributions. We
intend to make minimum quarterly distributions of $       per unit per quarter
(or $       per unit on an annualized basis).

We purchase motor fuel primarily from major integrated oil companies and
independent refiners and distribute it to GPM pursuant to three 10-year
wholesale motor fuel distribution agreements, which we refer to as the GPM
Distribution Contracts. As of June 30, 2015, GPM distributed volumes it
purchased from us to:

• over 620 convenience stores controlled by GPM;

• over 35 sites operated by independent dealers;

• over 25 sites owned or leased by GPM and operated by lessee dealers; and

• over 40 consignment locations where GPM sells motor fuel to retail customers.

Though we arrange for the transportation of motor fuel to GPM for sale to its
controlled convenience stores and consignment locations, we do not physically
transport any of the motor fuel. GPM directly arranges for transportation of
motor fuel to its independent and lessee dealers.

In addition to the volumes of motor fuel we distribute to GPM, we also
distribute motor fuel directly to approximately 10 sub-wholesalers and bulk
purchasers. Sub-wholesalers, in turn, distribute fuel to convenience stores.
Bulk purchasers primarily purchase motor fuel for their own use. For the six
months ended June 30, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014, we distributed
3.2 million and 7.0 million gallons of motor fuel to sub-wholesalers and bulk
purchasers, respectively. GPM is obligated to provide us a right of first offer
to purchase fuel distribution contracts for all convenience stores, dealer sites
and consignment locations that GPM acquires in the future.

The total amount of motor fuel we sold grew from 295.6 million gallons during
2011 to over 449.5 million gallons during 2014, primarily as a result of a
series of convenience store acquisitions by GPM. Since January 1, 2011, the
number of GPM-controlled convenience stores has grown from 210 to 625, while the
amount of motor fuel sold to such convenience stores has increased from
235.2 million gallons during 2011 to 380.9 million gallons during 2014.

During the twelve months ended June 30, 2015, and after giving pro forma effect
to the GPM Distribution Contracts (as defined below), approximately 99.0% of our
fuel gallons sold would have been pursuant to such contracts. Under the GPM
Distribution Contract, the GPM RR Distribution Contract and the GPM MW
Distribution Contract, we will be the exclusive distributor of motor fuel
purchased by GPM’s existing convenience stores, independent and lessee dealers
and consignment locations for 10 years at cost plus a fixed fee of 4.5 cents per
gallon.

We believe that we have limited exposure to fluctuating commodity prices because
we charge GPM the cost of our fuel plus a markup. GPM, in turn, passes these
costs along to its retail customers at its controlled convenience stores and
consignment locations and to the dealers it supplies.

In addition to revenues earned in our wholesale motor fuel distribution
business, we also receive rental income from convenience store properties that
we own and lease to third parties. At the closing of this offering, we expect to
receive rental income from six properties located in Delaware, New Jersey and
Virginia. Although we may purchase and lease convenience store properties to GPM
or third parties, we do not operate or have any intention to operate any
convenience stores at this time, though we may elect to do so in the future.

GPM Petroleum Files for $100M IPO
MLP will provide fuel distribution services to hundreds of c-stores.

April 20, 2015, 05:58 pm
By Brian Berk, Convenience Store News 


 



RICHMOND, Va. — GPM Petroleum LP on Monday filed a Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) to initiate an initial public offering (IPO) to raise up to $100 million by selling units of the wholesale distributor of motor fuels. The units will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GPMP.
If approved by the SEC, Richmond-based GPM Investments LLC would purchase a majority of its motor fuel from GPMP. According to the filing, GPM Investments has 502 convenience stores that sell motor fuel, merchandise, food, beverages and other products and services to retail customers in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeastern, Midwestern and Northeastern United States, including under the Fas Mart, Shore Stop and Road Ranger banners.
"Since its formation in 2003, GPM [Investments] has achieved significant growth through a series of eight acquisitions of convenience stores and dealer sites that have been successfully integrated into [its] existing business," the company wrote in the filing.
GPM Petroleum, now a division of GPM Investments, would be domiciled in Delaware and operate as a master limited partnership (MLP), which provides an advantageous tax structure compared to C corporations. However, GPM Petroleum must pay out a significant portion of its net profits to its unitholders as distributions.
According to the SEC filing, GPMP has several agreements already in place with GPM Investments post-IPO, including:

"A fuel distribution agreement, pursuant to which we will distribute the substantial majority of motor fuel purchased by GPM for sale to its existing convenience stores (other than convenience stores for which we are the distributor of motor fuel under the GPM RR Distribution Contract), independent and lessee dealers and consignment locations at cost, plus a fixed fee of 4.5 cents per gallon for a period of 10 years, in addition to future volumes added pursuant to the terms of our omnibus agreement, which we refer to as the GPM Distribution Contract;
A 10-year right of first offer to purchase the right to distribute fuel to GPM for newly acquired convenience stores at a negotiated rate; and
A 10-year right to participate in acquisitions with GPM, to the extent they are able to reach an agreement on terms.

In the filing signed by GPM Investments President and CEO Arie Kotler, GPMP stated that it should be able to thrive as a publicly traded independent company based upon a host of factors, including stable cash flows; a strong and experienced management team; long-term relationships with independent oil companies and independent refiners; and geographically diverse operations.
Looking ahead, Kotler outlined several business strategies for GPMP's growth, including purchasing the right to provide wholesale motor fuel to convenience stores that may be acquired by GPM Investments, as well as by directly acquiring wholesale motor fuel businesses with existing dealer operations.
"Through GPM [Investments'] expansion, we plan to further develop our wholesale motor fuel distribution both within our existing area of operations and in new geographic areas," the MLP wrote in its filing.

Post-IPO, GPMP expects to have plenty of funds available to make acquisitions independent of its parent company as well. "We believe our strong balance sheet and ability to access the debt and equity capital markets will provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue accretive acquisition and expansion opportunities," the company stated in its filing.
The percentage of GPMP shares to be owned by GPM Investments, as well as the exact makeup of the new company's management and board of directors is expected to be revealed in subsequent SEC filings.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
