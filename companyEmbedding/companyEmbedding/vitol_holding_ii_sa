Shell To Take Three Bids From Eight Further
May 12 17
Having received eight non-binding bids for its service-station chain - plus a refinery - in Argentina, Royal Dutch Shell plc (ENXTAM:RDSA) plans to draw up a three-bid short-list this month. It seems that the bids vary from $1 billion to $2 billion. A second stage of the sale-process could then be embarked upon at the tail-end of this month of May 2017. Royal Dutch Shell is working with Credit Suisse Group on this particular Argentinian divestment which does not include its oil-and-gas exploration-and-production assets locally. Potential buyers include Luksic Group. Other bidders include Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd. and Vitol Holding II S.A., RAÍZEN Combustíveis S.A., PetroChina Company Limited (SEHK:857) and YPF Sociedad Anonima (BASE:YPFD).

The Vitol Group is a global energy and commodity trading company that was founded in Rotterdam in 1966 by Henk Viëtor and Jacques Detiger.[1][2][4] Though physical trading, logistics and distribution are at the core of the business, these are complemented by refining, shipping, terminals, exploration and production, power generation, mining and retail businesses. Vitol has 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London, and Singapore. With revenues of $152 billion in 2016, it is the largest independent energy trader in the world, and would rank eighth on the Fortune Global 500 list.[5] Because Vitol does not publish its profits widely, much like most of its competitors in commodity trading, it is largely excluded from rankings. But the company does provide financial information to its lenders and some energy groups with which it trades.[6] The company ships more than 350 million tonnes of crude oil per year and controls 250 supertankers and other vessels to move it around the world. On average it handles more than 7 million barrels a day of oil and products - roughly equivalent to the daily consumption of Japan - the world's third largest oil consumer after the United States and China.[7][8]
The company’s chief executive is Ian Taylor. Vitol is a private company which is owned significantly by a proportion of its employees, who are known for their culture of privacy and secrecy, from both competitors and the general public.[4] In March 2015, the FT suggested that Vitol appeared to make a $1.2 billion dividend distribution.[9] [10][11]

Activities[edit]
Trading[edit]
In addition to the global crude and product trading businesses, the company trades coal, natural gas, power, ethanol, methanol, gasoline, LNG, LPG, naphtha, bitumen, base oils and carbon emissions.[12][13]
Terminals and infrastructure[edit]
In total, Vitol has around 16 million cubic meters of storage capacity across the globe.[14]
Vitol is the sole owner of VTTI B.V., a storage and terminals business with a capacity of around 8.7 million cubic meters (MCM) in 11 countries: Netherlands (1.328 MCM + 1.118 MCM), Latvia (1.195 MCM), UAE (1.180 MCM), Belgium (0.965 MCM), Malaysia (0.893 MCM), Cyprus (0.544 MCM), USA (0.452 MCM), Argentina (0.218 MCM), Kenya (0.111 MCM), Russia (0.049 MCM), Nigeria (0.016 MCM).[15] MISC Berhad held a 50% stake in VTTI from May 2010 until August 2015.[16]
In January 2012 Vitol acquired a stake in a subsidiary of the South African shipping firm Grindrod, which gives it access to a coal terminal in Mozambique.[17]
Refining[edit]
In addition to offices in Dubai and Bahrain, Vitol's key strategic asset in the Middle East is the Fujairah Refinery Company Limited (FRCL), which operates an 82,000 barrel per day refinery and a 1,034,000 cubic meter tank farm. FRCL has further development plans in place, which include a 140,000 cubic meter expansion of the tank farm, refurbishment of existing refining units and the installation of additional processing units.[18] Vitol also has invested in refining assets in Bayernoil, Germany, Cressier, Switzerland, Antwerp, Belgium and the Geelong refinery near Melbourne, Australia.
Exploration and production[edit]
Vitol, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Arawak Energy Limited and Vitol E&P, has interests in various exploration and production projects worldwide. Arawak Energy is mainly focused on the FSU where it produces oil and gas in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, while Vitol E&P holds a portfolio of exploration and development assets along the West African Transform Margin in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
In February 2014, it was reported that Vitol, in concert with the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, had bought the downstream businesses of Shell Australia (excluding aviation) for a total of approximately AU$2.9 billion. The purchase included Shell's Geelong Refinery and its 870-site retail business, along with its bulk fuels, bitumen, chemicals and part of its lubricants businesses in Australia.[19] The business trades as Viva Energy Australia, although the Shell brand remains on many of its retail products.[20]
Further in January 2015, Vitol in collaboration with Eni signed a $7 billion agreement with the government, for the production of oil and gas at Cape Three Points in Western Region of Ghana. The contract is expected to help meet Ghana's burgeoning energy needs.[21]
Aviation[edit]
Vitol Aviation is focused on Europe, North America and Africa, serving the world’s largest airlines and military customers with 5.7 million tonnes of jet fuel a year into wing.
Power[edit]
In 2013 Vitol invested in its first power plant, VPI Immingham in the UK. The combined heat and power plant (CHP) is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, capable of generating 1,240 MW and up to 930 tonnes of steam per hour which is used by nearby refineries. The gas-fired plant provides approximately 2.5% of UK peak electricity demand.
Figures[edit]
In 2016, Vitol traded:[13]

Oil: 351 million tonnes of crude oil and product sales
Natural Gas: over 20 billion cubic meters of physical gas globally
LPG: 10 million tonnes
Naphtha: 27 million tonnes
Gasoline: 1 million barrels of physical gasoline traded per day
Coal: over 30 million tonnes
Power: 102 TWh of power sales contracted
Carbon: 108 mm tonnes of contracted carbon volume
Methanol: 1.4 million tonnes
Chemicals: 4 million tonnes (Benzene and Paraxylene)

Controversies[edit]
A 2001 article in the Observer stated that in 1995 Vitol had secretly paid US$1 million to Serbian war criminal Arkan to settle a deal with a Serbian Oil company, Orion.[22][23] Vitol has denied all charges, arguing that no government agency has ever prosecuted the company in this respect.[24]
In 2007, Vitol pleaded guilty to grand larceny in a New York court for paying surcharges to Iraq's national oil company during Saddam's regime and circumventing the UN oil-for-food program. Vitol subsequently paid $17.5 million in restitution for its actions.[25]
According to an article in the Financial Times, Vitol was the company to organise the first controversial sale of Libyan rebel oil to Tesoro Corporation in early April 2011.[26] According to the Financial Times, the company was approached by the Qatari national oil company to sell a cargo of crude oil supplied by the Libyans in exchange for technological supplies and fuel for the National Transitional Council of Libya.[27]
In September 2012, an article in Reuters alleged that the company had bought and sold Iranian fuel oil, bypassing an EU embargo against Tehran. Vitol bought 2 million barrels using a ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Malaysia from a National Iranian Tanker Company vessel and sold it to Chinese traders. The article stated that as Vitol is based in Switzerland, which did not implement Western sanctions, Vitol had skirted the charges.[28]
In 2013, The Telegraph alleged that the company had been using for over a decade an Employee Benefit Trust, avoiding paying income tax for its UK staff.[29]

The Vitol Group is a global energy and commodity trading company that was founded in Rotterdam in 1966 by Henk Viëtor and Jacques Detiger.[1][2][4] Though physical trading, logistics and distribution are at the core of the business, these are complemented by refining, shipping, terminals, exploration and production, power generation, mining and retail businesses. Vitol has 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London, and Singapore. With revenues of $152 billion in 2016, it is the largest independent energy trader in the world, and would rank eighth on the Fortune Global 500 list.[5] Because Vitol does not publish its profits widely, much like most of its competitors in commodity trading, it is largely excluded from rankings. But the company does provide financial information to its lenders and some energy groups with which it trades.[6] The company ships more than 350 million tonnes of crude oil per year and controls 250 supertankers and other vessels to move it around the world. On average it handles more than 7 million barrels a day of oil and products - roughly equivalent to the daily consumption of Japan - the world's third largest oil consumer after the United States and China.[7][8]
The company’s chief executive is Ian Taylor. Vitol is a private company which is owned significantly by a proportion of its employees, who are known for their culture of privacy and secrecy, from both competitors and the general public.[4] In March 2015, the FT suggested that Vitol appeared to make a $1.2 billion dividend distribution.[9] [10][11]

Activities[edit]
Trading[edit]
In addition to the global crude and product trading businesses, the company trades coal, natural gas, power, ethanol, methanol, gasoline, LNG, LPG, naphtha, bitumen, base oils and carbon emissions.[12][13]
Terminals and infrastructure[edit]
In total, Vitol has around 16 million cubic meters of storage capacity across the globe.[14]
Vitol is the sole owner of VTTI B.V., a storage and terminals business with a capacity of around 8.7 million cubic meters (MCM) in 11 countries: Netherlands (1.328 MCM + 1.118 MCM), Latvia (1.195 MCM), UAE (1.180 MCM), Belgium (0.965 MCM), Malaysia (0.893 MCM), Cyprus (0.544 MCM), USA (0.452 MCM), Argentina (0.218 MCM), Kenya (0.111 MCM), Russia (0.049 MCM), Nigeria (0.016 MCM).[15] MISC Berhad held a 50% stake in VTTI from May 2010 until August 2015.[16]
In January 2012 Vitol acquired a stake in a subsidiary of the South African shipping firm Grindrod, which gives it access to a coal terminal in Mozambique.[17]
Refining[edit]
In addition to offices in Dubai and Bahrain, Vitol's key strategic asset in the Middle East is the Fujairah Refinery Company Limited (FRCL), which operates an 82,000 barrel per day refinery and a 1,034,000 cubic meter tank farm. FRCL has further development plans in place, which include a 140,000 cubic meter expansion of the tank farm, refurbishment of existing refining units and the installation of additional processing units.[18] Vitol also has invested in refining assets in Bayernoil, Germany, Cressier, Switzerland, Antwerp, Belgium and the Geelong refinery near Melbourne, Australia.
Exploration and production[edit]
Vitol, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Arawak Energy Limited and Vitol E&P, has interests in various exploration and production projects worldwide. Arawak Energy is mainly focused on the FSU where it produces oil and gas in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, while Vitol E&P holds a portfolio of exploration and development assets along the West African Transform Margin in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
In February 2014, it was reported that Vitol, in concert with the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, had bought the downstream businesses of Shell Australia (excluding aviation) for a total of approximately AU$2.9 billion. The purchase included Shell's Geelong Refinery and its 870-site retail business, along with its bulk fuels, bitumen, chemicals and part of its lubricants businesses in Australia.[19] The business trades as Viva Energy Australia, although the Shell brand remains on many of its retail products.[20]
Further in January 2015, Vitol in collaboration with Eni signed a $7 billion agreement with the government, for the production of oil and gas at Cape Three Points in Western Region of Ghana. The contract is expected to help meet Ghana's burgeoning energy needs.[21]
Aviation[edit]
Vitol Aviation is focused on Europe, North America and Africa, serving the world’s largest airlines and military customers with 5.7 million tonnes of jet fuel a year into wing.
Power[edit]
In 2013 Vitol invested in its first power plant, VPI Immingham in the UK. The combined heat and power plant (CHP) is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, capable of generating 1,240 MW and up to 930 tonnes of steam per hour which is used by nearby refineries. The gas-fired plant provides approximately 2.5% of UK peak electricity demand.
Figures[edit]
In 2016, Vitol traded:[13]

Oil: 351 million tonnes of crude oil and product sales
Natural Gas: over 20 billion cubic meters of physical gas globally
LPG: 10 million tonnes
Naphtha: 27 million tonnes
Gasoline: 1 million barrels of physical gasoline traded per day
Coal: over 30 million tonnes
Power: 102 TWh of power sales contracted
Carbon: 108 mm tonnes of contracted carbon volume
Methanol: 1.4 million tonnes
Chemicals: 4 million tonnes (Benzene and Paraxylene)

Controversies[edit]
A 2001 article in the Observer stated that in 1995 Vitol had secretly paid US$1 million to Serbian war criminal Arkan to settle a deal with a Serbian Oil company, Orion.[22][23] Vitol has denied all charges, arguing that no government agency has ever prosecuted the company in this respect.[24]
In 2007, Vitol pleaded guilty to grand larceny in a New York court for paying surcharges to Iraq's national oil company during Saddam's regime and circumventing the UN oil-for-food program. Vitol subsequently paid $17.5 million in restitution for its actions.[25]
According to an article in the Financial Times, Vitol was the company to organise the first controversial sale of Libyan rebel oil to Tesoro Corporation in early April 2011.[26] According to the Financial Times, the company was approached by the Qatari national oil company to sell a cargo of crude oil supplied by the Libyans in exchange for technological supplies and fuel for the National Transitional Council of Libya.[27]
In September 2012, an article in Reuters alleged that the company had bought and sold Iranian fuel oil, bypassing an EU embargo against Tehran. Vitol bought 2 million barrels using a ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Malaysia from a National Iranian Tanker Company vessel and sold it to Chinese traders. The article stated that as Vitol is based in Switzerland, which did not implement Western sanctions, Vitol had skirted the charges.[28]
In 2013, The Telegraph alleged that the company had been using for over a decade an Employee Benefit Trust, avoiding paying income tax for its UK staff.[29]

PRESS RELEASE: ADNOC signs 10-year deal for the sale of 528,000 tonnes per year of LPG



Home  Press Article  PRESS RELEASE: ADNOC signs 10-year deal for the sale of 528,000 tonnes per year of LPG


Press Article, Trading, 22 Feb 2017		
PRESS RELEASE: ADNOC signs 10-year deal for the sale of 528,000 tonnes per year of LPG 
Agreement creates long-term value and will help protect ADNOC from energy market fluctuations.
The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has signed an agreement with Vitol, the world’s largest independent energy trader, for the sale of up to 528,000 tonnes per year of LPG, to Vitol, over the next 10 years.
The long-term agreement, backdated to January 1, 2017 and which will expire on the 31st of December 2026, was signed on the side-lines of International Petroleum Week (IP WEEK), taking place in London, by Abdulla Salem Al Dhaheri, ADNOC Sales and Marketing Director and Russell Hardy, a member of Vitol’s Executive Committee.
Al Dhaheri said: “ADNOC has implemented a new strategy toward its LPG sales by negotiating longer term contracts to cope with the oversupply market especially after the Shale Gas Revolution.
“This agreement, which strengthens the long-standing relationship between ADNOC and Vitol, is a prime example of the innovative and different thinking we are bringing to our business deals. It will create reliable, long-term value and maximise our gas resources to ensure the company is resilient to future fluctuations in the global energy markets.”
Vitol is a private company founded in Rotterdam in 1966. It has over 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London and Singapore. Its primary business is the trading and distribution of energy products globally including over 6 million bpd of crude oil and products and 10 million tonnes of LPG annually. Revenues in 2015 were $168 billion.
Hardy said: “We are delighted to be working with ADNOC on this long-term supply agreement. LPG is an important clean fuel and this will support our growing downstream LPG business.”
Vitol’s energy assets globally include over 15.5 million cubic metres of storage across six continents; 390,000 bpd of refining capacity and Shell-branded downstream businesses in 16 African countries, as well as Australia. Vitol also has the only independent, long-standing refinery in Fujairah. Vitol’s customers include national oil companies, multinationals, leading industrial and chemical companies and the world’s largest airlines.
About ADNOC
ADNOC is a major diversified group of energy and petrochemical companies, that produces 3.1 million barrels of oil and 9.6 billion cubic feet of raw gas a day. Its integrated upstream, midstream and downstream activities are carried out by 16 specialist subsidiary and joint venture companies. To find out more visit www.adnoc.ae

Where we work



Home  Working with us  Where we work
Our customers and their requirements are as diverse as the world in which we live. Our colleagues comprise over 60 nationalities located in 40 offices worldwide. We have regional hubs in Bahrain, Geneva, Houston, London, Moscow, Rotterdam and Singapore and are invested in energy infrastructure across six continents.






The Americas
Vitol has a long-established presence across the Americas. From our main office in Houston, we manage trade flows within and to and from the continent, using our extensive network of storage and infrastructure to optimise the flow of crude oil and petroleum products. We are also a major participant in other key markets, including power and gas.

Europe
From a number of key locations around Europe, our European operations work closely with offices worldwide, supplying crude and products to European refineries, industrials and retail networks. As well as a significant physical presence in key energy hubs within the region, we are invested in three European refineries and a diverse portfolio of storage assets. We also supply Europe’s power sector and are actively involved in regional LNG, gas and power markets.

Middle East
With a history of working closely with national oil companies (NOCs) across the region, Vitol also has the only independent, long-standing refinery in Fujairah. We serve both regional and long haul markets, including Africa, and our global network enables us to help balance Middle Eastern incremental production across the regional refining system.

Africa
We have a growing footprint in Africa. We work closely with NOCs across the continent to help them optimise the value of their crude oil and to provide an efficient and reliable supply of key products to these growing markets. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure and have a growing downstream platform, with more than 2,000 service stations and over one million cubic metres of storage across 16 countries in Africa, as well as a unique gas-to-power project in Ghana, in collaboration with Eni, the World Bank and GNPC.

Asia Pacific
From our network of offices, we serve the energy needs of customers across the region. Our global trading network enables us to source the optimal feeds tocks for the region’s refiners, serve the needs of industrial companies and ensure the timely delivery of petroleum products to growing consumer markets. We are also invested in the Geelong refinery and the second largest downstream business in Australia, with over 920 service stations.






Worldwide location
We understand that every market is different and that our customers and their requirements are as diverse as the world in which we live. With 40 offices worldwide our colleagues comprise over 60 nationalities giving us a diversity of thinking which we believe translates into a greater understanding of our customers and enabling us to make better and more informed decisions.
Our office addresses can be found on the contact page.

Where we work



Home  Working with us  Where we work
Our customers and their requirements are as diverse as the world in which we live. Our colleagues comprise over 60 nationalities located in 40 offices worldwide. We have regional hubs in Bahrain, Geneva, Houston, London, Moscow, Rotterdam and Singapore and are invested in energy infrastructure across six continents.






The Americas
Vitol has a long-established presence across the Americas. From our main office in Houston, we manage trade flows within and to and from the continent, using our extensive network of storage and infrastructure to optimise the flow of crude oil and petroleum products. We are also a major participant in other key markets, including power and gas.

Europe
From a number of key locations around Europe, our European operations work closely with offices worldwide, supplying crude and products to European refineries, industrials and retail networks. As well as a significant physical presence in key energy hubs within the region, we are invested in three European refineries and a diverse portfolio of storage assets. We also supply Europe’s power sector and are actively involved in regional LNG, gas and power markets.

Middle East
With a history of working closely with national oil companies (NOCs) across the region, Vitol also has the only independent, long-standing refinery in Fujairah. We serve both regional and long haul markets, including Africa, and our global network enables us to help balance Middle Eastern incremental production across the regional refining system.

Africa
We have a growing footprint in Africa. We work closely with NOCs across the continent to help them optimise the value of their crude oil and to provide an efficient and reliable supply of key products to these growing markets. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure and have a growing downstream platform, with more than 2,000 service stations and over one million cubic metres of storage across 16 countries in Africa, as well as a unique gas-to-power project in Ghana, in collaboration with Eni, the World Bank and GNPC.

Asia Pacific
From our network of offices, we serve the energy needs of customers across the region. Our global trading network enables us to source the optimal feeds tocks for the region’s refiners, serve the needs of industrial companies and ensure the timely delivery of petroleum products to growing consumer markets. We are also invested in the Geelong refinery and the second largest downstream business in Australia, with over 920 service stations.






Worldwide location
We understand that every market is different and that our customers and their requirements are as diverse as the world in which we live. With 40 offices worldwide our colleagues comprise over 60 nationalities giving us a diversity of thinking which we believe translates into a greater understanding of our customers and enabling us to make better and more informed decisions.
Our office addresses can be found on the contact page.

Careers



Home  Careers
An introduction to the Vitol Group
5441 employees across Vitol & its key investmentsIt isn’t ships or terminals or cargoes that create our success: it’s the calibre of our people.
Being a global business, they come from all over the world and represent a vibrant mix of different nationalities, educational backgrounds and life experiences. In fact, today, people from around 60 different countries work for the Vitol Group, all around the world. They continue to build our reputation as a leading player in the energy markets through their creativity, commitment, professionalism and entrepreneurial spirit.
Below is a very brief summary of what we do and the way we work. However, before applying for any opportunity we may have, we recommend you explore the main pages of this website and familiarise yourself more fully with our business.
Who are we? What do we do?
The Vitol Group is one of the largest independent energy trading groups in the world and operates through a global group of companies.
Although mainly a physical oil trader, the Group is now broadly based – with active trading operations in gas, coal, power, non-ferrous metals, derivatives and sugar. Essentially, we trade energy: we create markets for fuel products; we deliver cargoes, safely, on-specification and on-time; we provide extensive terminal and storage facilities; and we engineer innovative financing structures to the benefit of our customers. Through the Vitol Foundation, we are also active in charitable funding to benefit severely deprived children in Asia, Africa, Latin America and CIS.

Vitol 2014 Results



Home  Group  Vitol 2014 Results


Group, Trading, 12 Mar 2015		
Vitol 2014 Results 
Financial highlights
• Revenues of $270bn (2013:$307bn)*
• Total traded volumes of crude and oil products of 268mt (2013: 276mt)
• 6,053 ship journeys (2013: 6,065)
• Natural gas contracted sales of 1,202 TWh (2013: 1,297TWh)
• Power contracted sales of 117TWh (2013: 94TWh)
• Coal contracted sales of 34mt (2013: 51mt)
Business highlights
• Acquisition of Shell’s Australian downstream business and launch of Viva Australia
• Commencement of transformational oil and gas project for Ghana, working with ENI and GNPC
• Successful NYSE listing of VTTI Energy Partners MLP, part of VTTI
• Investment in Varo Energy, the European refining and distribution business
Ian Taylor, President & CEO said:
“As the largest independent trader of energy, the rapid slide in the price of crude in the last quarter of 2014 impacted our headline revenue figure which has fallen to $270 billion. For a brief time the market structure presented some interesting opportunities for a physical trader, notwithstanding the additional challenges of hedging physical cargoes in a highly volatile market.
“We are focused on continuing to evolve our downstream portfolio. The acquisition of Shell’s Australian downstream business and Geelong refinery, in which a further $115 million is being invested, gave us a significant footprint in Asia-Pacific. In Europe, we continue to invest in Varo Energy, the refining and distribution business which we own jointly with The Carlyle Group, and which has over $50 million of investment scheduled for 2015. Vivo Energy, which is the Shell licensee in 16 countries across Africa and in which we have a 40% shareholding, continues to grow with over 100 service stations opened in 2014.
“For VTTI, the terminals business we established in 2006 and grew further with our partners MISC of Malaysia from 2010, 2014 marked the next stage of its development with the NYSE listing of VTTI Energy Partners MLP, where it joins the other MLP in the Group, Blueknight Energy Partners.
“With our proven expertise in building and managing energy infrastructure and our position at the heart of physical energy flows around the world, we are exploring further opportunities to develop energy infrastructure in a number of growing economies. In Ghana, where we have been working with our Ghanaian partners for over twenty-five years, we are delighted to be deploying our expertise on a transformational oil and gas project for the country, alongside ENI and GNPC.
“Looking ahead, despite an improvement in near-term product demand, questions remain on both the demand and supply sides. The economic outlook appears to be improving and should receive a further boost from cheaper energy prices. However, geo-political risks continue to cast a shadow over both production and demand in many regions and other factors, such as where the marginal cost of US shale oil production really lies, are critical to understanding future supply.
“2014 was a demanding year for the Group and I would like to thank our clients and partners for continuing to collaborate and work with us.”
