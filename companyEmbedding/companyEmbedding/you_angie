Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here? With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats You can't say were satisfied But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried Angie, you're beautiful, but ain't it time we said goodbye? Angie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried? All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke Let me whisper in your ear: Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here? Oh, Angie, don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet I hate that sadness in your eyes But Angie, Angie, ain't it time we said goodbye? With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats You can't say were satisfied But Angie, I still love you, baby Everywhere I look I see your eyes There ain't a woman that comes close to you Come on baby, dry your eyes But Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be alive? Angie, Angie, they can't say we never tried

Published on Dec 22, 2008Angie by the rolling stones with lyrics. one of my favorite songs. and bands. Manson made a cameo appearance as a doctor in the Murderdolls' music video "Dead in Hollywood", and also appears in the Nine Inch Nails music video "Starfuckers, Inc.", as well as "Gave Up"His first appearance in a film was in the role of a pornographic actor in David Lynch's Lost Highway, in 1997. He also had a minor role in former love interest Rose McGowan's 1998 film Jawbreaker and a supporting role in 2003's Party Monster. Manson made a cameo appearance in a short film in the BMW Films series (starring Clive Owen as the Driver), which featured James Brown as himself, and Gary Oldman as Satan. His most talked-about film cameo was in the Michael Moore political documentary Bowling for Columbine discussing the motivations of the perpetrators and allegations that his music was somehow a factor. He played himself, in animated form, on an episode of the television series Clone High, in which he sang a song about nutrition and the food pyramid. Manson portrayed a psychotic drag queen named Christina in the movie Party Monster which is based on the events leading up to and the murder of Angel Melendez by the infamous Michael Alig ofLittle Abby singing So Pathetic by Local H , and calling me a stupid pathetic boyManson made a cameo appearance as a doctor in the Murderdolls' music video "Dead in Hollywood", and also appears in the Nine Inch Nails music video "Starfuckers, Inc.", as well as "Gave Up"His first appearance in a film was in the role of a pornographic actor in David Lynch's Lost Highway, in 1997.

Manson portrayed a psychotic drag queen named Christina in the movie Party Monster which is based on the events leading up to and the murder of Angel Melendez by the infamous Michael Alig of club kid fame. He is featured prominently throughout Not Another Teen Movie, and covered the song Tainted Love for that movie.His music is frequently featured on the show C.S.I.. The character on the show, Greg Sanders, is a big fan of Manson and the actor who plays him, Eric Szmanda is personal friends with Manson.Manson was featured in the 2004 film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, and is set to appear in Abelcain, directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Living Neon Dreams in 2005. He will also be seen as a bartender in an upcoming vampire movie starring Lucy Liu called Rise.In July 2005, Manson told Rolling Stone Magazine that he was shifting his focus from music to filmmaking - "I just don't think the world is worth putting music into right now. I no longer want to make art that other people--particularly record companies--are turning into a product. I just want to make art." He is currently working on his directorial debut, Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll, which was put on his website around the end of 2006. The film is said to feature special effects using a magician rather than computer-generated imagery.[10]In artManson is also a watercolor painter. An exhibit for his art was held at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions on September 13, September 14, 2002 and also at the Hotel Lutecia, Paris on September 14, 2004 and the next day in Berlin. He contributed a piece to the West Memphis Three benefit exhibition at six spaces. Many of his paintings have sold for over $5,000; buyers include Jack Osbourne, Nicolas Cage, Dave Navarro, Andy Dick and Lisa Marie Presley. He has stated that a new book containing all his pieces of art work will be released in the near future, possibly 2006.[citation needed]Manson opened his own gallery October 31, 2006 in Los Angeles. The gallery, The Celebritarian Corp. Gallery of Fine Art, opened with a showing of Manson's watercolors. [11]In other areasManson provided the voice of the alien Edgar in the 2005 first-person shooter videpurpose of autofellatio. "If I really got my ribs removed," he said in his autobiography[25], "I would have been busy

Feel beautiful

Be beautiful
Inside and out
 

                Younique's mission is to uplift, empower, validate, and ultimately build self-esteem in women around the world through high-quality products that encourage both inner and outer beauty and spiritual enlightenment while also providing opportunities for personal growth and financial reward.            







            Love It. Share It. Live It.        



                    Every day, hundreds of women experience the excitement of joining a family of like-minded women who inspire them to reach their true potential and achieve the things they’ve always dreamed of in a supportive, safe family environment. From day one of registration, a brand-new Younique Presenter joins the family and is able to immediately start selling the products through her very own, simple, yet feature-rich, e-commerce store. She gets instant access to the Younique Virtual Party System™, her Younique Back Office, and to a wealth of easy-to-reference training material.

            Staying Connected        



 



                       We are the first direct sales company to market and sell almost exclusively through the use of social media.  Our pioneered Younique Virtual Parties bridge the huge world of social media and the traditional home party business model.  A Younique Virtual Party has no limits to your reach or who you can invite.  This makes it so the traditional home party is not even necessary unless you choose to do it.  We provide the innovative and interactive tools and invite you to tap into your own resources and connections that you already have.   Hosting a Younique Party is as easy as sharing a link!

            Nature. Love. Science.        



                    Younique's cosmetics development processes utilize scientific research to ensure that our products contain high quality ingredients that enrich and nourish the skin. The result is a beautifully efficacious product that is safely compatible with virtually every skin type.                
                   Younique begins by looking to Mother Nature for the inspiration behind our cosmetics. Our in-house scientific team then formulates a product that honors that inspiration while delivering cutting-edge cosmetics. Our goal is to provide healthy, clean, and pure cosmetics.

                        Without science, we’d still be using pigmented dirt and crushed berries on our faces as ‘makeup.’

So Yummy! Angie’s Popcorn Review

So Yummy! Angie’s Popcorn Review
 Share1 Flip Yum Stumble +1 Tweet PinShares 1Our family absolutely loves popcorn! We have a movie night every Sunday night and we always make popcorn. I recently received some Popcorn from Angie’s Popcorn to review and it was gone in days!
We were able to review the Sweet and Salty Kettle corn and the Sweet and Spicy Kettle Corn. The girls wanted to dig into the popcorn right away and frankly so did I! I am kind of a popcorn snob, in order for me to eat the popcorn it has to be made by my husband or really really good. I absolutely loved both of the flavors that we received. The girls both loved the Kettle Corn and couldn’t wait to have more and more. My husband and I both loved the Sweet and Spicy Kettle Corn and boy does it have a bit of a kick! We really love our new snack and it’s my favorite thing to snack on now!
“ANGIE’S Boomchickapop is a national brand distributed in natural food, grocery, club and mass retail outlets in all 50 states as well as in Canada.  Look for us in the natural food aisle.  We like to think the A is for awesome.
ANGIE’S our company
A select few ingredients are carefully chosen and popped fresh, batch by batch, in Mankato, Minnesota.  It’s how Angie’s started, and we intend to keep it that way. Led by founders Angie and Dan Bastian, 150 or so others now help make the magic and the popcorn happen on a daily basis. Together we make 80,000 bags of popcorn daily, deliciously ready for you.
ANGIE’S products & flavors
We’re always testing new flavors and putting out our absolute favorites as limited editions or new products. And, as always, Angie personally tastes and approves every new product that leaves the building!  Boomchickapop also came along as the little sister to Angie’s kettle corn and popcorn. Like many siblings, they were born in the same place and to the same people, but with distinct personalities.” ( Angie’s Popcorn website)
“Snacking is a good thing. We like to make it a really good thing.   At Angie’s, we work hard to make snacks that are delightfully different. Never quite what you’re expecting. Always better.   While we want to keep our flavors and products interesting, anything we make will have to live up to the Angie’s standard, with popcorn and kettle corn made with nothing but ingredients you’ll love.   It’s pretty simple. And that can make the process a little more complicated. We wouldn’t have it any other way.   Q: What does “Naturally Simple” mean?


No high-fructose corn syrup
No artificial sweeteners
No artificial flavors or preservatives
No trans fats” ( Angie’s website)


Angie’s Popcorn has so many different flavors like Sea Salt Popcorn, Lightly Sweet, Sweet & Salty Kettle Corn, Salted Caramel, Sweet & Salty mix and more! I can’t wait to try their other flavors.
Please visit www.angiespopcorn.com/where-to-buy-angies/ to find out where you can purchase this yummy popcorn!

Angie’s Popcorn gets Bragging Rights!
