Education[edit]
In 1972, Mr Panke graduated from the University of Munich (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München) in physics, having started his studies in 1968, and received his Ph.D. in 1976.[3]
Prior to his studies, during the period from 1964 to 1965, he was an AFS Exchange Student to the United States.[6] After the award of the doctorate degree in nuclear physics, Mr Panke joined the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research.[7]
Career[edit]
From 1976 to 1978, Panke was a researcher at the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research and a lecturer at the University of Munich.
From 1978 to 1982, he was a consultant with McKinsey & Company.[3] In 1982, he started at Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW)[5] as a head of planning and control of the research and development division,[7] before assuming management functions in 1985.[8]
He later said that his attraction to the company was based on the reputation it had for encouraging creativity and independence among its staff.[7]
Over the next 20 years, Panke worked his way up through the company, working in nearly every department: he served as the chairman of the management board at BMW (UK) Capital PLC,[8] and as Chairman and CEO of BMW (US) Holding Corporation from 1993 to 1996, he managed the US manufacturing facility that was responsible for building, as well as corporate planning, organisation, staff, IT, finance and sales.[7] From 1996 to 1999, his tasks focused on Human Resources and Information Technology.[8] From 1999 to 2002, he served as a member of the board of management responsible for finance.[8]
In 2002, Panke succeeded Joachim Milberg to become the chairman of BMW after Milberg's resignation due to health reasons.[7] During his tenure from May 16, 2002 until September 1, 2006,[8] he was credited with leading the company’s internationalization and his refusal to move the company into the lower priced mass market.[7]
In 2004, he was elected into the board of directors of UBS AG, where he served as a member for eleven years. He left the BoD at the Annual General Meeting of 2015, stepping down due to regulatory provisions regarding the term of office.[9] Mr. Panke joined UBS AG in 1982, when he was appointed Head of Planning and Controlling in the Research and Development Division. He also worked as a member of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and of the Risk Committee since 2008.[8]
Current mandates[edit]
Panke has served on the board of directors for Microsoft since November 11, 2003,[8] as the first board member from outside the United States.[5] He is also the chairman of the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee, a member of the Compensation Committee and of the Audit Committee of Microsoft.[8]
He is a board member of Singapore Airlines Ltd. and chairs the Safety and Risk Committee in the organization.[10] He is also a member of the supervisory board of Bayer AG since October 2006.[5]
Furthermore, he serves as a member of the advisory board at Dubai International Capital LLC since 2007,[11] a member of the board of directors of Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA (USA),[8] a member of the supervisory board at Bayer Schering Pharma AG[8] and Bayer Pharma AG.[8]
Mr. Panke serves as a member of the board of directors of ACEA, the Association des Constructeurs Européens d’Automobiles, Belgium,[8] a member of the board of directors of VDA, the association of the German automobile industry,[8] and of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany.[8]

Education[edit]
In 1972, Mr Panke graduated from the University of Munich (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München) in physics, having started his studies in 1968, and received his Ph.D. in 1976.[3]
Prior to his studies, during the period from 1964 to 1965, he was an AFS Exchange Student to the United States.[6] After the award of the doctorate degree in nuclear physics, Mr Panke joined the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research.[7]
Career[edit]
From 1976 to 1978, Panke was a researcher at the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research and a lecturer at the University of Munich.
From 1978 to 1982, he was a consultant with McKinsey & Company.[3] In 1982, he started at Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW)[5] as a head of planning and control of the research and development division,[7] before assuming management functions in 1985.[8]
He later said that his attraction to the company was based on the reputation it had for encouraging creativity and independence among its staff.[7]
Over the next 20 years, Panke worked his way up through the company, working in nearly every department: he served as the chairman of the management board at BMW (UK) Capital PLC,[8] and as Chairman and CEO of BMW (US) Holding Corporation from 1993 to 1996, he managed the US manufacturing facility that was responsible for building, as well as corporate planning, organisation, staff, IT, finance and sales.[7] From 1996 to 1999, his tasks focused on Human Resources and Information Technology.[8] From 1999 to 2002, he served as a member of the board of management responsible for finance.[8]
In 2002, Panke succeeded Joachim Milberg to become the chairman of BMW after Milberg's resignation due to health reasons.[7] During his tenure from May 16, 2002 until September 1, 2006,[8] he was credited with leading the company’s internationalization and his refusal to move the company into the lower priced mass market.[7]
In 2004, he was elected into the board of directors of UBS AG, where he served as a member for eleven years. He left the BoD at the Annual General Meeting of 2015, stepping down due to regulatory provisions regarding the term of office.[9] Mr. Panke joined UBS AG in 1982, when he was appointed Head of Planning and Controlling in the Research and Development Division. He also worked as a member of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and of the Risk Committee since 2008.[8]
Current mandates[edit]
Panke has served on the board of directors for Microsoft since November 11, 2003,[8] as the first board member from outside the United States.[5] He is also the chairman of the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee, a member of the Compensation Committee and of the Audit Committee of Microsoft.[8]

Helmut Panke - Bloomberg




























































  
















Helmut Panke


                    Chief Executive, Bavarian Motor Works, Germany
                




June 7, 2004, 12:00 AM EDT








 
        
         
      
      
                
          
          
          
          
          
      
      
      
              BMW Chief Executive Helmut Panke has just sped into a tight curve at high speed and is gaining on the competition. While European rivals groan about stagnant economies, sluggish sales, and careening profits, Panke is overseeing a rapid model expansion that's driving impressive growth. Launched in 2002, the roll-out of new models aims to boost sales by 40% by 2008. And Panke wants to push the company's lofty profits even higher. 
      
       
       
       
      
      
      
       
            
        
      
      
So far, Panke is right on track. Last year the 57-year-old physicist increased sales at BMW by 4.5%, to 1.1 million cars. And that was before a slew of stylish new models hit showrooms from Los Angeles to Shanghai. The real acceleration comes this year as an expanded model lineup, including the 6-Series coupe ($70,000), the X3 baby SUV ($31,000), and the much-awaited 1-Series (an estimated $26,000) -- come onto the market. BMW's new models will help the auto maker come nose-to-nose in global passenger-car sales this year with Mercedes-Benz, the world's largest luxury brand, according to a forecast by market researcher Global Insight's Frankfurt office.
Panke demands top performance from his troops, and from himself. A hands-on CEO who routinely swings through factories, sales offices, company cafeterias, and research labs, he's as comfortable racing a BMW down a test track as he is spotting problems on the production line or analyzing industry trends. Panke is BusinessWeek's leading star manager because of his deft stewardship of BMW through its strenuous expansion drive.








Since he took over as CEO in 2002, he has kept BMW firing on all cylinders. Last year, BMW edged out Toyota Motor Corp.'s (TM
      ) Lexus in the U.S. market as No.1 seller of luxury sedans. Sales in Asia are booming, and European growth is outpacing the competition. Panke first demonstrated his skills at building BMW's global business as head of North American operations in the mid-1990s. On his watch the U.S. has become BMW's largest market.
Panke's management style could be called Socratic. He loves to pose questions and lead debates with groups of managers -- a practice that reflects his academic training and gets results. After earning a doctorate in nuclear physics from the University of Munich, he conducted research at the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research while also teaching physics in Munich. In 1978, he was lured away by McKinsey & Co.'s Munich office, where he eventually wound up consulting for BMW. In 1982, the auto maker hired him as head of planning at its research and development division. Since then, he has tracked every facet of the business, from corporate strategy to production and sales.

By encouraging debate, Panke has forged a performance-driven culture that isn't afraid to send tough questions up the ranks.  "Panke takes a huge amount of time to discuss with people, then he lets them manage on their own. That way he gets 120% from everyone," says a manager who has seen Panke rise up the ranks over 20 years. Panke also gets high marks for consistently honing BMW's brand image, launching new models without production glitches, and focusing the company's strategy. "My biggest challenge is saying 'no' to projects that are exciting but don't fit BMW's strategy," he says.
The market is applauding. Although a strong euro dented sales and profits slightly in 2003 -- sales were down 2.1%, to $50 billion, while net profit fell 3.6%, to $2.3 billion -- BMW's stock price has risen 27% in the past year. Once thought too small to survive on its own, BMW now boasts a $27.3 billion market value, the fifth in the industry. Not bad for a CEO who's two years into the job -- and Panke is only warming up.

Helmut Gunter Wilhelm Panke[1] (born on 31 August 1946[2][3] in Fürstenwalde, East Germany[4]) is a senior German manager and is currently holding board membership in several companies - Microsoft, Bayer AG and Singapore Airlines.

Education[edit]
In 1972, Mr Panke graduated from the University of Munich (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München) in physics, having started his studies in 1968, and received his Ph.D. in 1976.[3]
Prior to his studies, during the period from 1964 to 1965, he was an AFS Exchange Student to the United States.[6] After the award of the doctorate degree in nuclear physics, Mr Panke joined the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research.[7]
Career[edit]
From 1976 to 1978, Panke was a researcher at the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research and a lecturer at the University of Munich.
From 1978 to 1982, he was a consultant with McKinsey & Company.[3] In 1982, he started at Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW)[5] as a head of planning and control of the research and development division,[7] before assuming management functions in 1985.[8]
He later said that his attraction to the company was based on the reputation it had for encouraging creativity and independence among its staff.[7]
Over the next 20 years, Panke worked his way up through the company, working in nearly every department: he served as the chairman of the management board at BMW (UK) Capital PLC,[8] and as Chairman and CEO of BMW (US) Holding Corporation from 1993 to 1996, he managed the US manufacturing facility that was responsible for building, as well as corporate planning, organisation, staff, IT, finance and sales.[7] From 1996 to 1999, his tasks focused on Human Resources and Information Technology.[8] From 1999 to 2002, he served as a member of the board of management responsible for finance.[8]
In 2002, Panke succeeded Joachim Milberg to become the chairman of BMW after Milberg's resignation due to health reasons.[7] During his tenure from May 16, 2002 until September 1, 2006,[8] he was credited with leading the company’s internationalization and his refusal to move the company into the lower priced mass market.[7]
In 2004, he was elected into the board of directors of UBS AG, where he served as a member for eleven years. He left the BoD at the Annual General Meeting of 2015, stepping down due to regulatory provisions regarding the term of office.[9] Mr. Panke joined UBS AG in 1982, when he was appointed Head of Planning and Controlling in the Research and Development Division. He also worked as a member of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and of the Risk Committee since 2008.[8]
Current mandates[edit]
Panke has served on the board of directors for Microsoft since November 11, 2003,[8] as the first board member from outside the United States.[5] He is also the chairman of the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee, a member of the Compensation Committee and of the Audit Committee of Microsoft.[8]
He is a board member of Singapore Airlines Ltd. and chairs the Safety and Risk Committee in the organization.[10] He is also a member of the supervisory board of Bayer AG since October 2006.[5]
Furthermore, he serves as a member of the advisory board at Dubai International Capital LLC since 2007,[11] a member of the board of directors of Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA (USA),[8] a member of the supervisory board at Bayer Schering Pharma AG[8] and Bayer Pharma AG.[8]
Mr. Panke serves as a member of the board of directors of ACEA, the Association des Constructeurs Européens d’Automobiles, Belgium,[8] a member of the board of directors of VDA, the association of the German automobile industry,[8] and of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany.[8]

Helmut Gunter Wilhelm Panke[1] (born on 31 August 1946[2][3] in Fürstenwalde, East Germany[4]) is a senior German manager and is currently holding board membership in several companies - Microsoft, Bayer AG and Singapore Airlines.

Education[edit]
In 1972, Mr Panke graduated from the University of Munich (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München) in physics, having started his studies in 1968, and received his Ph.D. in 1976.[3]
Prior to his studies, during the period from 1964 to 1965, he was an AFS Exchange Student to the United States.[6] After the award of the doctorate degree in nuclear physics, Mr Panke joined the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research.[7]
Career[edit]
From 1976 to 1978, Panke was a researcher at the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research and a lecturer at the University of Munich.
From 1978 to 1982, he was a consultant with McKinsey & Company.[3] In 1982, he started at Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW)[5] as a head of planning and control of the research and development division,[7] before assuming management functions in 1985.[8]
He later said that his attraction to the company was based on the reputation it had for encouraging creativity and independence among its staff.[7]
Over the next 20 years, Panke worked his way up through the company, working in nearly every department: he served as the chairman of the management board at BMW (UK) Capital PLC,[8] and as Chairman and CEO of BMW (US) Holding Corporation from 1993 to 1996, he managed the US manufacturing facility that was responsible for building, as well as corporate planning, organisation, staff, IT, finance and sales.[7] From 1996 to 1999, his tasks focused on Human Resources and Information Technology.[8] From 1999 to 2002, he served as a member of the board of management responsible for finance.[8]
In 2002, Panke succeeded Joachim Milberg to become the chairman of BMW after Milberg's resignation due to health reasons.[7] During his tenure from May 16, 2002 until September 1, 2006,[8] he was credited with leading the company’s internationalization and his refusal to move the company into the lower priced mass market.[7]
In 2004, he was elected into the board of directors of UBS AG, where he served as a member for eleven years. He left the BoD at the Annual General Meeting of 2015, stepping down due to regulatory provisions regarding the term of office.[9] Mr. Panke joined UBS AG in 1982, when he was appointed Head of Planning and Controlling in the Research and Development Division. He also worked as a member of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and of the Risk Committee since 2008.[8]
Current mandates[edit]
Panke has served on the board of directors for Microsoft since November 11, 2003,[8] as the first board member from outside the United States.[5] He is also the chairman of the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee, a member of the Compensation Committee and of the Audit Committee of Microsoft.[8]
He is a board member of Singapore Airlines Ltd. and chairs the Safety and Risk Committee in the organization.[10] He is also a member of the supervisory board of Bayer AG since October 2006.[5]
Furthermore, he serves as a member of the advisory board at Dubai International Capital LLC since 2007,[11] a member of the board of directors of Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA (USA),[8] a member of the supervisory board at Bayer Schering Pharma AG[8] and Bayer Pharma AG.[8]
Mr. Panke serves as a member of the board of directors of ACEA, the Association des Constructeurs Européens d’Automobiles, Belgium,[8] a member of the board of directors of VDA, the association of the German automobile industry,[8] and of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany.[8]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
