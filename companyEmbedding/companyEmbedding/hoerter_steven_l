			Steve Hoerter joined our board of directors in December 2016. Mr. Hoerter currently serves as Chief Commercial Officer of Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a position he has held since February 2016, and has more than twenty years of global pharmaceutical and biotechnology experience, previously having served as executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Clovis Oncology, Inc. There, Mr. Hoerter built and led the global commercial organization that developed go-to-market strategies for two oncology therapies. Before joining Clovis in 2011, he was general manager and management center head at Roche for the Sub-Saharan Africa and Indian Ocean Region. From 2005 to 2010, Mr. Hoerter held a variety of positions at Genentech, Inc., including serving on the senior leadership team for Genentech's BioOncology business as senior director, Pipeline Development and Commercial Operations. Prior to that, Mr. Hoerter held commercial roles at Chiron Corporation and Eli Lilly and Company in the U.S., Europe and Africa. Mr. Hoerter received a B.A. in Russian and political science from Bucknell University, an M.B.A. from Tilburg University, and an M.S. in management from Purdue University. We believe that Mr. Hoerter adds value to our board of directors based on his senior management experience in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, with expertise in drug development and commercialization, and other aspects of our industry.
