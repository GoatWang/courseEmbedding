Find Family Physicians in Florida (FL) by City

    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.

I went in for my first visit yesterday and it was a very nice surprise.LOCATION- the office is located in a large intersection- the Regions Bank Building on 36th and Biscayne so its impossible to miss it! Parking is free and offices are tidy! STAFF- the reason why i chose this DR to begin with was the service i got over the phone- i went through a list of places and most places had really unprofessional and rude receptionists- at which case i hung up and tried a different number until BINGO! i hit this office. The receptionist is very polite and soft spoken. She is very professional and just a pleasure to speak to! Very nice and friendly -first PLUS!I did wait a little longer than usual but the front desk young lady told me that my insurance was having technical difficulties and she couldn't get in touch with them. They had a nice big flat screen TV in the reception which made my wait barely noticeable.DR- She is extremely nice and polite. So genuinely concerned and listened to all my crazy rants and medical history ups and downs. She was very receptive to all my comments and offered great advice and even helped me with recommendations on other specialists i should see. She even had the front desk girl make copies  with specialist information and wrote referrals so i wouldn't have any problems with my insurance covering my services. She also took down the names of all my prescription meds and found cheaper alternatives and then sent them directly to my pharmacy so i wouldn't even have to bother dropping them off WOW! this place is really amazing and understands people and how to take care of them and their needs. I would most definitely recommend this place 100%Luis C Guerrero MD PAPhilosophy T. ratedReform does work!  i've known this doctor for overt 13 yrs.  Great bedside manners and the old-school technique of writing in a notepad is for your own i.d. protection!  Reform does work!  He is compassionate and does feel your pain.  He takes an interest in the entire family even though the family is not under his care.  He makes visits to hospitals and he is well-rounded, highly qualified and I can understand why his patients believe he is is an "angel", who knows?  He might have studied in the seminary for some time as well, all I know is that there is no subject that this professional does not now.  If a certain medication does not work, he will find one that will work according to the patient's symptoms.  As a matter of fact, I don't know how is able to handle one patient after the next.  He handles some of the most bizzare, complex cases to some of the most heart-warming ones.  This alone requires discipline.  Congratulations Dr., you have made it in your field of passion, you have made the journey that most of us, quite frankly never find.  You sir, have "traveled the road, less traveled" (this is Wisdom - Euripedes).  I found you quite worthy as a human being and doctor and I have no doubt that other scholars have found the same in you from all corners of the world.  Mahatma Ghandi, Mother Teresa, Pope John Paul, II; and so may others would be proud.Christopher Hodgkins MDAlex D. ratedMy experience with Dr. Hodgkins & his staff are excellent!! I was supposed to do a 70.3 at the end of the month of Sept  in Augusta Georgia  and 3 week prior my race broke my ankle while training on my cycling bike on 9/3/2016 had surgery on 9/6/16. I was devastated  and I couldn't  believe it that this was happening  to me so I left it in god hand. Since I did already sign up for a full Ironman 140.6  in Nov-2016 and the race is for Nov 2017,  I was scare to death that was going to able to compete on  this race, I did ask the Dr. if I was able to run again, and he told me I would be back to normal within the six month is only been 5 month and one week and I  been swimming, cycling and running on the treadmill 3 to 5 miles twice a week and today he gave me the news that I wanted to hear that I could run in the pavement, I thank god everyday how lucky I am to have this Dr. come thru my path and perform surgery and his staff for taking care of me.From the bottom of  my Heart THANK YOU!!!!  Dr. Hodgkins and your staff!! Alex D.Pazmino, Byron, MDAnto G. ratedI was very nervous about a facelift because of so many horror stories I've heard & seen but my daughter n law had a tummy tuck with Dr. Pazmino so when I saw how great he was with her I knew I had found my surgeon . His hands are blessed !! I'm a few days out & the staff has really gone above & beyond for me . I feel so comfortable . When I first got there I met Cathy who really made the financial part of this surgery possible . Then , I met Jesenia who I had spoken to on the phone before & really made me feel confident about what I was about to do going over some details about the procedure. Finally I had my visit before my surgery I met Malena who went over what to expect & how I can best get ready for the surgery . I have truly had a smooth experience . I'm 3 days out and I'm barely bruised & feel great but if I feel & look great now , then I can only imagine in a few weeks ! So excited to get some of my youth back .Christopher Hodgkins MDOscar A. ratedDr. Hodgkins is a true professional and an amazing surgeon. I fractured my ankle and when I visited Dr Hodgkins he explained everything in great detail and was there to answer every question I had. I never felt rushed. His bedside manners were great. I knew that he would be the doctor to operate me. The follow up post surgery was awesome. They followed up to see if I felt good and if I had any questions for the doctor. 17 weeks post surgery I feel great! The office appointments are very punctual If your appointment is at 330pm, you are in at 330pm! They never make you wait more than 10 min.  The operation was a total success. People see me walking now and cant believe I had surgery just a few weeks ago! I would definitely recommend Dr Hodgkins to anyone who needs ankle surgery.Carlos E. Wiegering, MDUrsula A. ratedMe hace feliz compartir mi testimonio con todos ustedes sobre mi experiencia con el Dr. Carlos Wiegering., como cirujano plástico; tuve la oportunidad de conocerlo ademas de atenderme con el y a partir de ese momento mi felicidad fue inmensa, no solo por los resultados que fueron excelentes sino por el servicio que allí me prestaron desde el mismo momento en que llegue a sus instalaciones.El Doctor Carlos Wiegering brinda una seguridad y confianza a todos sus pacientes, lo que se hace fácil decidirse en operarse con él . Recomiendo al Doctor Carlos Wiegering , por su profesionalismo, su calidad humana y por su equipo de trabajo que es sin duda alguna el mejor. Reitero mi cariño y satisfacción y les envió un saludo muy especial al Doctor y todos sus colaboradores.DR Christian Gonzalezambercs ratedThe best in AventuraDr. Gonzalez's staff was extremely complementary, I felt a true sense of care from the moment I walked into the office. All of his front office staff are extremely knowledgeable and compassionate... and that is truly hard to find these days! Dr. Gonzalez took his time with me and answered all of my questions, and fit me in his schedule even though I didn't have an appointment. I had to have an injection in my back and was very nervous,  but Dr. Gonzalez took my mind off the procedure,  and before I knew it, it was over. Dr. Gonzalez has outstanding bedside manner and I would recommend him to ANYONE who has back problems. Hands down Dr. Gonzalez is one of the BEST physicians I have seen in a very long time!Christopher Hodgkins MDBarbra H. ratedDr. Hodgkins is AMAZING!  My husband and my daughter are both patients of his.  My husband had a serious accident 2 years ago and Dr. Hodgkins went above and beyond to care for him.  It was a long recovery and he was with my husband every step of the way.  My daughter has had two injuries within the last year and a half and we went to him immediately for both injuries.  We have also recommended him to several friends and others that have reached out to us for a recommendation.  He is an AMAZING doctor who we have the upmost respect for!  Also, his office staff, especially Jen, are awesome.  She is efficient and on top of things!  We have never had a bad experience with this office.Ojea Juan CarlosGregg M. ratedWas treated like crap. I don't know if it was because he had a bad day at his job at the hospital or what. But I've never been treated so rudely by a doctor. Sit in his office for five hours waiting for him to show up. I was forced to bend and move which was very painful, especially after sitting in that hard chair for five hours. Just to be talked to and treated like crap. He didn't even look at my records, only went by what his nurses put in the file. The urine test was completely wrong. I honestly think he was just having a bad day, surely he doesn't treat people he doesn't know like that. Christopher Hodgkins MDE K. ratedI am 60 years old and Dr Hodgkins is probably the best Dr I have ever been to. He is an excellent surgeon and excels at his profession - I broke my ankle and had to have 12 screws, 1 large plate, 2 buttons and a trapeze to hold it all together. I have basically had no pain since 2 days postop. His bedside manner is incredible and he really wants his patients to be happy and he and his staff work very hard to achieve that. I have never written a review for a medical professional but he is so fabulous that he and his staff deserve my highest compliments.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you. After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online, such as yellowpages.com. You can check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.Why should I hire a lawyer?If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, or you need help to navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. Also, during times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you might need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available.What can I have an attorney do for me?When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.

You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship.
The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.
You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Ask as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle.
How much will an attorney cost?You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant. Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Can I ask an attorney about past cases they worked on?You can ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases. You should check their office for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You can also ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.What does a family lawyer do?Family attorneys deal with personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork, such as adoption or inheritance documents.What does a divorce attorney do?Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.What does a personal injury lawyer do?When you're hurt by an outside party, and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.What does a civil attorney do?If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.What does a bankruptcy lawyer do?A bankruptcy lawyer can help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors.

Betzsammcgee ratedGoing through a divorce was th...Going through a divorce was the worst experience in my life. I saw everything falling apart, and my wife threatened to do everything she could to restrict my access to our two sons if she didn't get everything she wanted. Fortunately, Mr. Betz helped to ease my fears by explaining to me what my rights and obligations were. When I realized I would not lose my children my emotional state improved dramatically. I was able to deal with the whole frustrating process with more equanimity than I thought possible. Ultimately we settled on joint custody and a shared parenting relationship which has certainly turned out to be best for the boys. I couldn't have done it without the good advice and guidance of my lawyer. I'd recommend him to anyone. Law Office of William E. BetzElizabeth W. ratedProfessional and Genuine Mr Betz stuck it out for what I believe to be the long haul. I've been in and out of courts for years now with a custody battle.As a Dad of three small children it was tearing me apart and Mr Betz was always there to ease the pain reassuring me that we'll get through this. He was right after a few years I was awarded  custody of my two daughters and a situation has come to light and now together we're fighting for the custody of my son. After informing him I couldn't afford to go through this again he let me know that this is not about money it's about (saving a child) Thank you Mr Betz I will always be in debt to you.Law Office of William E. Betzcarrotop305 ratedVery effective, no-nonsense attorney who represented me well in post-judgment proceedings.  Will definitely use his services in the future and I would recommend him to all.  Cost-effective as well, and his rates compare more than favorably to lawyers of similar experience.Radow Law GroupLester G. ratedThey helped me with my real estate problem and provided a solution. Their experience in the legal business is very impressive and I am thankful to have them on my team. I will surely hire them back for legal advice.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
