	Our People


	Board of Directors


SAM L. BANKS – FOUNDER AND CEO Mr. Banks is the founder and majority owner of Yuma Energy, Inc.  He has 37 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, the majority of which he has been leading Yuma.  He graduated from Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana with a B.A. degree in 1972.  In 1976, he served as Republican Assistant Finance Chairman for the Re-election of President Gerald Ford, under former Secretary of State Robert Mosbacher.  From the end of 1976 to 1982, Mr. Banks was assistant to the President of Tomlinson Interests, a private, independent oil and gas company.  Mr. Banks founded Yuma in 1983, and has been responsible for all aspects of the company’s business growth, including the development of Yuma's business opportunities in exploration, production, pipelines, gas distribution, and gas trading.   RICHARD K. STONEBURNER – CHAIRMAN, APPOINTED IN SEPTEMBER 2013 Mr. Stoneburner has more than 35 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. He holds a B.S. in Geological Sciences from the University of Texas and a M.S. in Geological Sciences from Wichita State University.  Mr. Stoneburner began his career as a geologist in 1977, and held positions of responsibility and leadership with Texas Oil and Gas Corp., Weber Energy Corp., Hugoton Energy Corp. and 3TEC Energy Corp. He joined Petrohawk Energy in 2003, where he led Petrohawk’s exploration program from 2005 to 2007 prior to serving as the company’s President and COO from 2007 to 2011.  When BHP Billiton acquired Petrohawk in 2011, he was appointed President of the North America Shale Production Division where he managed operations in the Fayetteville Shale, the Haynesville Shale, the Eagle Ford Shale, and the Permian Basin divisions.  Mr. Stoneburner currently serves on the Board of Directors of Newfield Exploration and Cub Energy and serves as a Senior Advisor to the private equity firm Pine Brook Partners.  Prior to his appointment as Director, he was a Board Advisor to Yuma from July 2013.   JAMES W. CHRISTMAS – APPOINTED IN SEPTEMBER 2013 Mr. Christmas has extensive experience in oil and gas company growth issues, with a focus on capital structure and business development strategies.  He began his career as a Certified Public Accountant in New York.  He was with Arthur Andersen & Co. from 1970 until 1978, before leaving to join National Utilities & Industries (“NUI”), a diversified energy company, as Vice President and Controller.  He remained with NUI until 1988, when NUI spun out its unregulated activities that ultimately became part of KCS Energy, Inc.  Mr. Christmas served as President and CEO of KCS from 1988 until 2003, and Chairman of the Board and CEO from 2003 until KCS’s merger into Petrohawk in 2006.  During his time as CEO, Mr. Christmas helped build KCS from a $10 million company to one of nearly $2.0 billion in value at the time of the merger with Petrohawk in 2006.  BHP Billiton acquired Petrohawk in August 2011, and at the request of BHP, Mr. Christmas has continued to serve as a director of Petrohawk and Chairman of its financial reporting committee.  He currently serves on the Board of Directors of Halcon Resources Corporation, and is a guest lecturer of a graduate class in entrepreneurship at St. John’s University in New York.  In addition, he serves on the advisory board for The Peter J. Tobin College of Business at St John’s, and underwrites an annual business plan competition to foster entrepreneurship.   FRANK A.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
