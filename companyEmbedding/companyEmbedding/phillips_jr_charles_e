Early life and education
Charles E. Phillips, Jr. was born in June 1959 in Little Rock, Arkansas,[1] where his father was stationed in the Air Force. During his childhood his family moved often from state to state, and to Europe as well.[1][5]
Phillips was fascinated by computers and technology from an early age, and spent his spare time during high school building computers.[1] His father expected at least one of his four sons to join the Air Force, and Phillips enrolled at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado and earned a BS in computer science in 1981.[1] When his eyesight did not meet the rigorous standard to be a pilot, he accepted a commission in the Marines. He joined as a Second Lieutenant, rising to the rank of Captain, and was stationed at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, where he worked on computer systems.[5]
Phillips obtained an MBA from Hampton University in 1986. He also attended New York Law School, obtaining a JD in 1993.
Career
Early career
From 1981 to 1986, Phillips was in the U.S. Marine Corps in the 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines artillery unit at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, managing computer systems. He had joined as a Second Lieutenant and rose through the ranks to become a Captain.[1]
Phillips began his civilian career in 1986, and he and his wife Karen moved to New York, where his wife had relatives.[5] He joined BNY Mellon as Vice President of Software, and was at the company for four years. He then transferred to SoundView Technology Group, where he was Senior Vice President from 1990 through 1993, and Kidder Peabody, where he was Senior Vice President from 1990 through 1994.
In 1994, Phillips joined Morgan Stanley as an enterprise software-industry analyst in the technology group,[6][7] and he was promoted to Managing Director, a role in which he served through 2003.
Phillips spent his time on Wall Street nurturing relationships with hedge funders, venture capitalists, private equity executives, technology CEOs, and other business and financial leaders, and gained a reputation for being one of the most aggressive, connected, influential, and prolific technology investment analysts.[5][8] Institutional Investor ranked him the number one Enterprise Software Industry Analyst for ten consecutive years, from 1994 to 2003.[1]
Oracle
Among Phillip's industry contacts during his Wall Street years was Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison, who invited him to join Oracle in 2003. Phillips accepted, and served as co-president and director of Oracle from 2003 to 2010.[5]
Phillips led Oracle's field organization, and during his tenure he oversaw the company's revenue growth of nearly 300%. He also played a key role in Oracle's long series of acquisitions of 70 companies, including PeopleSoft,[7] BEA Systems, Hyperion Solutions, and Siebel Systems, among others.[2] Responsible for Oracle’s sales and acquisitions, Phillips utilized his networking, negotiation, and closing skills,[5] and became one of the highest-profile African-Americans in the technology industry in the mid 2000s.[9] In 2007, InformationWeek called him "Oracle's Secret Weapon".[10] After seven years growing the company, Phillips resigned from Oracle in September 2010.[11]
Infor
In October 2010 Phillips was announced as CEO of Infor, the world’s third largest provider of enterprise applications and services, and the world’s largest privately owned software company.[12][13][14] He was joined by several high-ranking Oracle executives.[15][16] Within four months of being hired, he led Infor's $2 billion acquisition of Lawson Software, a competitor focused on the health care industry,[5] and continued Infor's acquisitions at the rate of two or more per year.[17] In October 2011, Phillips moved Infor's headquarters from the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta, Georgia to New York City's Silicon Alley.[5][18]
Phillips immediately set about re-directing Infor and its efforts,[19] instilling a corporate culture of camaraderie, goodwill, and reward.[5][20] He also focused Infor on excellent design and product coherence,[5] establishing product usability and highly attractive modern interface as key components in Infor's software lines.[15][19] To optimize user experience design, Phillips and his team formed Hook & Loop, an internal creative agency of writers, designers, developers, and filmmakers who develop software that is beautiful and user-friendly and has social-media type elements.[15][20] Infor now maintains a design directive of "work is beautiful", and Hook & Loop is one of the largest digital design agencies in New York City.[21][22]
To further differentiate Infor from its competitors, including Oracle and SAP, he focused Infor on niche acquisitions: smaller companies, and highly specialized divisions within large corporations that are applicable to "micro-verticals" or unique sub-industries.[5][23] Under his direction Infor updated big industry-specific applications from older software languages to .Net and Java programming languages.[24] Phillips also changed Infor's focus from building scale to innovation and products. He refocused Infor towards enhanced product integration,[19][25] and to custom-creating and fine-tuning software for the specific needs of individual industries.[15][18][26] Within three years of his leadership, Infor launched 300 new products and hired 1,500 new engineers.[19][27] Phillips also directed the company to open-source infrastructure.[23][28][29][30]
At the 2014 Amazon Web Services Summit, Phillips gave the keynote address. He announced the launch of Infor CloudSuite, the first group of industry-specific application suites to be available on Amazon Web Services's cloud.[27][29][31][32]
Advisorships and philanthropy
In February 2009, Phillips was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide President Barack Obama and his administration with advice and counsel in addressing the late-2000s recession.[33]
Phillips has made large contributions to non-profits, schools, community groups, and civic groups. In 2010, he combined several of his charities into the Phillips Charitable Organization (PCO), a non-profit foundation. PCO’s primary focus is on helping single parents, wounded veterans, and students working towards engineering, science, technology, or mathematics degrees.[34] PCO is a major backer of Harlem Village Academies.[35]
Phillips is on the board of directors of the American Museum of Natural History, Viacom, Jazz at Lincoln Center, New York Law School, the United States Air Force Academy Endowment Fund, and the Posse Foundation.[4] He was also a Democratic Party delegate from New York in 2004.[7]

Early life and education
Charles E. Phillips, Jr. was born in June 1959 in Little Rock, Arkansas,[1] where his father was stationed in the Air Force. During his childhood his family moved often from state to state, and to Europe as well.[1][5]
Phillips was fascinated by computers and technology from an early age, and spent his spare time during high school building computers.[1] His father expected at least one of his four sons to join the Air Force, and Phillips enrolled at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado and earned a BS in computer science in 1981.[1] When his eyesight did not meet the rigorous standard to be a pilot, he accepted a commission in the Marines. He joined as a Second Lieutenant, rising to the rank of Captain, and was stationed at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, where he worked on computer systems.[5]
Phillips obtained an MBA from Hampton University in 1986. He also attended New York Law School, obtaining a JD in 1993.
Career
Early career
From 1981 to 1986, Phillips was in the U.S. Marine Corps in the 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines artillery unit at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, managing computer systems. He had joined as a Second Lieutenant and rose through the ranks to become a Captain.[1]
Phillips began his civilian career in 1986, and he and his wife Karen moved to New York, where his wife had relatives.[5] He joined BNY Mellon as Vice President of Software, and was at the company for four years. He then transferred to SoundView Technology Group, where he was Senior Vice President from 1990 through 1993, and Kidder Peabody, where he was Senior Vice President from 1990 through 1994.
In 1994, Phillips joined Morgan Stanley as an enterprise software-industry analyst in the technology group,[6][7] and he was promoted to Managing Director, a role in which he served through 2003.
Phillips spent his time on Wall Street nurturing relationships with hedge funders, venture capitalists, private equity executives, technology CEOs, and other business and financial leaders, and gained a reputation for being one of the most aggressive, connected, influential, and prolific technology investment analysts.[5][8] Institutional Investor ranked him the number one Enterprise Software Industry Analyst for ten consecutive years, from 1994 to 2003.[1]
Oracle
Among Phillip's industry contacts during his Wall Street years was Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison, who invited him to join Oracle in 2003. Phillips accepted, and served as co-president and director of Oracle from 2003 to 2010.[5]
Phillips led Oracle's field organization, and during his tenure he oversaw the company's revenue growth of nearly 300%. He also played a key role in Oracle's long series of acquisitions of 70 companies, including PeopleSoft,[7] BEA Systems, Hyperion Solutions, and Siebel Systems, among others.[2] Responsible for Oracle’s sales and acquisitions, Phillips utilized his networking, negotiation, and closing skills,[5] and became one of the highest-profile African-Americans in the technology industry in the mid 2000s.[9] In 2007, InformationWeek called him "Oracle's Secret Weapon".[10] After seven years growing the company, Phillips resigned from Oracle in September 2010.[11]
Infor
In October 2010 Phillips was announced as CEO of Infor, the world’s third largest provider of enterprise applications and services, and the world’s largest privately owned software company.[12][13][14] He was joined by several high-ranking Oracle executives.[15][16] Within four months of being hired, he led Infor's $2 billion acquisition of Lawson Software, a competitor focused on the health care industry,[5] and continued Infor's acquisitions at the rate of two or more per year.[17] In October 2011, Phillips moved Infor's headquarters from the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta, Georgia to New York City's Silicon Alley.[5][18]
Phillips immediately set about re-directing Infor and its efforts,[19] instilling a corporate culture of camaraderie, goodwill, and reward.[5][20] He also focused Infor on excellent design and product coherence,[5] establishing product usability and highly attractive modern interface as key components in Infor's software lines.[15][19] To optimize user experience design, Phillips and his team formed Hook & Loop, an internal creative agency of writers, designers, developers, and filmmakers who develop software that is beautiful and user-friendly and has social-media type elements.[15][20] Infor now maintains a design directive of "work is beautiful", and Hook & Loop is one of the largest digital design agencies in New York City.[21][22]
To further differentiate Infor from its competitors, including Oracle and SAP, he focused Infor on niche acquisitions: smaller companies, and highly specialized divisions within large corporations that are applicable to "micro-verticals" or unique sub-industries.[5][23] Under his direction Infor updated big industry-specific applications from older software languages to .Net and Java programming languages.[24] Phillips also changed Infor's focus from building scale to innovation and products. He refocused Infor towards enhanced product integration,[19][25] and to custom-creating and fine-tuning software for the specific needs of individual industries.[15][18][26] Within three years of his leadership, Infor launched 300 new products and hired 1,500 new engineers.[19][27] Phillips also directed the company to open-source infrastructure.[23][28][29][30]
At the 2014 Amazon Web Services Summit, Phillips gave the keynote address. He announced the launch of Infor CloudSuite, the first group of industry-specific application suites to be available on Amazon Web Services's cloud.[27][29][31][32]
Advisorships and philanthropy
In February 2009, Phillips was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide President Barack Obama and his administration with advice and counsel in addressing the late-2000s recession.[33]
Phillips has made large contributions to non-profits, schools, community groups, and civic groups. In 2010, he combined several of his charities into the Phillips Charitable Organization (PCO), a non-profit foundation. PCO’s primary focus is on helping single parents, wounded veterans, and students working towards engineering, science, technology, or mathematics degrees.[34] PCO is a major backer of Harlem Village Academies.[35]
Phillips is on the board of directors of the American Museum of Natural History, Viacom, Jazz at Lincoln Center, New York Law School, the United States Air Force Academy Endowment Fund, and the Posse Foundation.[4] He was also a Democratic Party delegate from New York in 2004.[7]

Early life and education
Charles E. Phillips, Jr. was born in June 1959 in Little Rock, Arkansas,[1] where his father was stationed in the Air Force. During his childhood his family moved often from state to state, and to Europe as well.[1][5]
Phillips was fascinated by computers and technology from an early age, and spent his spare time during high school building computers.[1] His father expected at least one of his four sons to join the Air Force, and Phillips enrolled at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado and earned a BS in computer science in 1981.[1] When his eyesight did not meet the rigorous standard to be a pilot, he accepted a commission in the Marines. He joined as a Second Lieutenant, rising to the rank of Captain, and was stationed at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, where he worked on computer systems.[5]
Phillips obtained an MBA from Hampton University in 1986. He also attended New York Law School, obtaining a JD in 1993.
Career
Early career
From 1981 to 1986, Phillips was in the U.S. Marine Corps in the 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines artillery unit at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, managing computer systems. He had joined as a Second Lieutenant and rose through the ranks to become a Captain.[1]
Phillips began his civilian career in 1986, and he and his wife Karen moved to New York, where his wife had relatives.[5] He joined BNY Mellon as Vice President of Software, and was at the company for four years. He then transferred to SoundView Technology Group, where he was Senior Vice President from 1990 through 1993, and Kidder Peabody, where he was Senior Vice President from 1990 through 1994.
In 1994, Phillips joined Morgan Stanley as an enterprise software-industry analyst in the technology group,[6][7] and he was promoted to Managing Director, a role in which he served through 2003.
Phillips spent his time on Wall Street nurturing relationships with hedge funders, venture capitalists, private equity executives, technology CEOs, and other business and financial leaders, and gained a reputation for being one of the most aggressive, connected, influential, and prolific technology investment analysts.[5][8] Institutional Investor ranked him the number one Enterprise Software Industry Analyst for ten consecutive years, from 1994 to 2003.[1]
Oracle
Among Phillip's industry contacts during his Wall Street years was Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison, who invited him to join Oracle in 2003. Phillips accepted, and served as co-president and director of Oracle from 2003 to 2010.[5]
Phillips led Oracle's field organization, and during his tenure he oversaw the company's revenue growth of nearly 300%. He also played a key role in Oracle's long series of acquisitions of 70 companies, including PeopleSoft,[7] BEA Systems, Hyperion Solutions, and Siebel Systems, among others.[2] Responsible for Oracle’s sales and acquisitions, Phillips utilized his networking, negotiation, and closing skills,[5] and became one of the highest-profile African-Americans in the technology industry in the mid 2000s.[9] In 2007, InformationWeek called him "Oracle's Secret Weapon".[10] After seven years growing the company, Phillips resigned from Oracle in September 2010.[11]
Infor
In October 2010 Phillips was announced as CEO of Infor, the world’s third largest provider of enterprise applications and services, and the world’s largest privately owned software company.[12][13][14] He was joined by several high-ranking Oracle executives.[15][16] Within four months of being hired, he led Infor's $2 billion acquisition of Lawson Software, a competitor focused on the health care industry,[5] and continued Infor's acquisitions at the rate of two or more per year.[17] In October 2011, Phillips moved Infor's headquarters from the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta, Georgia to New York City's Silicon Alley.[5][18]
Phillips immediately set about re-directing Infor and its efforts,[19] instilling a corporate culture of camaraderie, goodwill, and reward.[5][20] He also focused Infor on excellent design and product coherence,[5] establishing product usability and highly attractive modern interface as key components in Infor's software lines.[15][19] To optimize user experience design, Phillips and his team formed Hook & Loop, an internal creative agency of writers, designers, developers, and filmmakers who develop software that is beautiful and user-friendly and has social-media type elements.[15][20] Infor now maintains a design directive of "work is beautiful", and Hook & Loop is one of the largest digital design agencies in New York City.[21][22]
To further differentiate Infor from its competitors, including Oracle and SAP, he focused Infor on niche acquisitions: smaller companies, and highly specialized divisions within large corporations that are applicable to "micro-verticals" or unique sub-industries.[5][23] Under his direction Infor updated big industry-specific applications from older software languages to .Net and Java programming languages.[24] Phillips also changed Infor's focus from building scale to innovation and products. He refocused Infor towards enhanced product integration,[19][25] and to custom-creating and fine-tuning software for the specific needs of individual industries.[15][18][26] Within three years of his leadership, Infor launched 300 new products and hired 1,500 new engineers.[19][27] Phillips also directed the company to open-source infrastructure.[23][28][29][30]
At the 2014 Amazon Web Services Summit, Phillips gave the keynote address. He announced the launch of Infor CloudSuite, the first group of industry-specific application suites to be available on Amazon Web Services's cloud.[27][29][31][32]
Advisorships and philanthropy
In February 2009, Phillips was appointed as a member to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide President Barack Obama and his administration with advice and counsel in addressing the late-2000s recession.[33]
Phillips has made large contributions to non-profits, schools, community groups, and civic groups. In 2010, he combined several of his charities into the Phillips Charitable Organization (PCO), a non-profit foundation. PCO’s primary focus is on helping single parents, wounded veterans, and students working towards engineering, science, technology, or mathematics degrees.[34] PCO is a major backer of Harlem Village Academies.[35]
Phillips is on the board of directors of the American Museum of Natural History, Viacom, Jazz at Lincoln Center, New York Law School, the United States Air Force Academy Endowment Fund, and the Posse Foundation.[4] He was also a Democratic Party delegate from New York in 2004.[7]

Former Oracle President Phillips Lands C.E.O. Gig at Infor


				By Ashlee Vance			
October 25, 2010 8:30 am
October 25, 2010 8:30 am



It took Charles E. Phillips Jr., the former co-president of Oracle, all of about six weeks to find a new job.
Oracle Charles Phillips will become the chief executive of Infor, which makes business software.
On Monday, Mr. Phillips, who stepped down from his Oracle post last month, will show up as the new chief executive of Infor, a business software maker based in Atlanta. The company’s claim to fame, if you can call it that, is owning the largest business software franchise no one has ever heard of. Infor sells about $2 billion worth of software per year, mostly to midsized companies.
“This is a rare opportunity to be the chief executive of an applications company with real scale,” Mr. Phillips said. “I am thrilled to be doing this.”
A vigorous game of executive musical chairs has been taking place in the business software market.
The same day that Mr. Phillips left Oracle, the company tapped Mark V. Hurd, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, to fill the role vacated by Mr. Phillips.
H.P. then named Léo Apotheker, the former head of SAP, as its new chief executive.
Since its founding in 2002, Infor has tried to go after smaller customers neglected by the likes of SAP, Oracle and I.B.M. It built up its business selling software for the manufacturing and financial services sectors and then filled out its portfolio through 70 acquisitions.
Today, Infor sells a wide range of products like customer relationship management, expense management, work force management and supply chain management software.
“A lot of our competitors talk about going after the midmarket – some with varying degrees of success,” said Jim Schaper, Infor’s former chief executive who will stay on as chairman. “We were actually built to serve the midmarket.”
As for Oracle, SAP and other big players’ aspirations for the midmarket, Mr. Phillips said: “That has been a desire for decades. It’s just very hard to do.”
Mr. Phillips joins a very long list of former top Oracle executives who have left only to compete with the company and its chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison.
“I have spoken to Larry,” Mr. Phillips said. “He is quite proud to produce another C.E.O. in the industry.”
Infor plans to release a new product platform in January and the presence of Mr. Phillips is sure to draw added attention to these wares.
Mr. Phillips will continue to have the company headquartered in Atlanta – the same city where he went to high school.
“I have a lot of connections down there,” Mr. Phillips said. “To me, that was a big plus.”
Infor appears to be on track to file for an initial public offering or certainly to be acquired by the likes of Oracle, SAP and I.B.M. — which seem to gobble up every middleware maker in sight.
“One of the challenges of any company that makes over 70 acquisitions is just getting the back office prepared to be a public filer,” Mr. Schaper said. “All of that is behind us now. The markets will determine if this is an I.P.O. candidate and when.”

The spurned mistress of one of Barack Obama's top economic advisers has exacted revenge by plastering details of their affair on giant billboard posters across the U.S. YaVaughnie Wilkins is said to have paid £150,000 to reveal her relationship with Charles Phillips to the world after he went back to his wife. The posters, which are three storeys high, show Miss Williams and the senior member of the president's hand-picked Economic Recovery Advisory Board below his initials and a quote saying: 'You are my soulmate forever.'

  There is also a link to a website that is a shrine to his eight-year affair with Miss Wilkins, 41. 
It includes pictures
chronicling their travels around the world as well as intimate notes
and ticket stubs from concerts, films, sports games and Mr Obama' s
inauguration a year ago. 
One of the giant signs is
posted on Broadway near Times Square in New York - one of the world's most prominent advertising hoardings.A further two have appeared elsewhere in New York as well as one in Atlanta and one in San Francisco, where Miss Wilkins lives and her married ex-lover owns a family home. Each are said to have cost £30,000 to display. The billboards baffled Americans when
they first appeared – with speculation mounting over whether it was a
marketing ploy or an apology.Her
extraordinary actions had the desired effect. The chief executive has
been forced into an embarrassing public statement in which he admitted
their affair.












 
Adventures: Wilkins set up a website of photos of the couple's world travels, including Sydney, right
 




Powerful: Phillips, circled, was an adviser to U.S. President Barack ObamaYesterday Mr Phillips, 50, who is also president of internet giant Oracle, issued a brief three-sentence statement saying: 'I had an eight-and-a-half year serious relationship with YaVaughnie Wilkins. 'My divorce proceedings began in 2008. The relationship with Ms Wilkins has since ended and we both wish each other well.' There has been speculation that YaVaughnie deliberately timed her campaign to coincide with a major Oracle event next week. Website Gawker noted that the company was due to host an all-day live event on January 27.Mr Phillips was paid £12million last year and has made around £30million since 2007.He has recently reconciled with his wife, Karen,
according to reports in the U.S. 
The couple were seen at an
awards ceremony in New York and pictured together at a gala held by the
American Museum of Natural History in the city in November. They have a
ten-year-old son, Chas. 
Miss Wilkins, a
California-based actress and writer, was not available for comment
yesterday.  




Reconciliation: Phillips is back living with his wife Karen (centre) and their 10-year-old son in New York 




Pressure: Phillips said he wished Wilkins well after intimate photos posted online forced him to admit the affair
 




'Soulmates': The website, paid for by Wilkins, shows photos of the pair enjoying holidays abroad











 
Pressure: Phillips was forced to admit the affair after the billboard posters and website went live

 
  




High-profile campaign: Wilkins paid $50,000 for each poster - including this one in New York 












 
Promises: Wilkins put the love notes sent from Phillips during their affair online
 Her website shows Mr Phillips and her standing arm-in-arm on
the Great Wall of China and posing in Sydney wearing matching
'Australia' jackets. 
One of the photo albums
from 2001 is set to a karaoke performance of the Smokey Robinson song
Cruisin', where a man and a woman can be heard singing: 'This is not a
one-night stand.' 
There is also a huge collection of notes from Mr Phillips. 
One gushes: 'You're all
that matters to me.' Another reads: 'I have never met a woman as
fascinating as you. You are exactly what I've been looking and waiting
for.' 
Miss Wilkins wrote: 'Charles, You have my heart for ever  -  I love you so much.' 
California-based web
designer Bela Kovacs claimed he was asked to build the site,
charlesphillipsandyavaughniewilkins.com, as 'a present for Charles'. 
Last night visitors to the website were met with a 'service unavailable' message. 
The White House refused to comment last night on whether the billboards would affect Mr Phillips's position. 
But an administration aide said it was being treated as a 'private matter.' An
expert software analyst, Phillips is viewed as one of the most powerful
people in the industry. He joined the company in 2003 and previously
worked for Morgan Stanley. He is a former captain in the United States
Marine Corps.
New York bloggers have gone into
overdrive today with some claiming Phillips led a double life -
presenting himself as a divorcee while still married.




Revenge: YaVaughnie Wilkins paid for three posters, which baffled Americans when they first appearedTsarinamisha, who claims to be a
'close friend' of the couple,' wrote on Gawker's website: 'I can assure
you he portrayed himself as having been legally divorced in 2003.'Their closeness and the fact that their relationship was very public led no one to believe otherwise.'They attended family and professional events as a couple, lived together for eight years and bought a home about two years ago.'I was a guest at numerous of their parties and he introduced her to numerous people, including his son, as his girlfriend.'

Spurned: Wilkins posted the details on the affair online after Phillips went back to his wife, Karen
 Dbishty, who like Tsarinamisha, left
a post on Gawker's website said: 'There was never any indication there
was a third party in their relationship. 'Charles
and YaVaughnie spent quite a bit of money on their estate so it doesn't
make sense that things have turned out this way. 'The
realtor at Coldwell Bankers and contractors at Genesis, Inc. and Bethe
Cohen Design associated with the couple have nothing but glowing things
to say about YaVaughnie and Charles. 'If he is married, YaVaughnie did not know. She believed him, as we all did, when he said he was divorced.'However, another blogger on the Gawker site said
Phillips was still attending events with his wife – including the
American Natural History Museum’s gala event last November. 




Details: Wilkins' website detailed photographs dating from 2001
