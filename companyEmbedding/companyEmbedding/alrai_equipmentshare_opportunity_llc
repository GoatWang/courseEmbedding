            A business needs an EIN in order to pay employees and to file business tax returns. 
            To be considered a Partnership, LLC, Corporation, S Corporation, Non-profit, etc. a business must obtain an EIN.

EquipmentShare snaps up $26 mln


January 24, 2017
By Iris Dorbian






EquipmentShare, a provider of construction technology solutions for contractors and original equipment manufacturers, has raised $26 million in funding. Insight Venture Partners and return backer Romulus Capital led the round with participation from Y Combinator. In conjunction with the funding, Harley Miller, vice president at Insight Venture Partners, has been added to EquipmentShare’s board of directors
PRESS RELEASE
COLUMBIA, Mo (Jan. 24, 2017) – EquipmentShare, a leading provider of construction technology solutions that help contractors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) better manage equipment and make smarter business decisions, has secured $26 million in funding led by Insight Venture Partners and existing investor Romulus Capital. Y Combinator, another existing investor, also participated in the round. With this capital, EquipmentShare will launch its mixed-fleet telematics solution, ES Track, and open peer-to-peer marketplace locations in eight additional U.S. markets.
“We’re honored to have the continued support of Romulus Capital, specifically managing partner Neil Chheda, who has played a key role in the company’s growth, and look forward to drawing from Insight’s expertise and experience,” said Willy Schlacks, president of EquipmentShare.
“Since our founding, we’ve committed ourselves to helping the construction industry become more efficient, lucrative and productive,” said Schlacks. “With this funding, we’re able to spark even greater change in the construction industry by further expanding our rental marketplace footprint and providing contractors everywhere with the telematics data they need to optimize their equipment.” 





ES Track is the construction industry’s most robust telematics platform, providing contractors with the ability to track the location, health and use of their fleet in real time, all in one place.
Built specifically for the construction industry, ES Track provides in-depth oversight tools and analytics for both contractors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Previously available only to EquipmentShare’s marketplace users, ES Track will now be available for
contractors everywhere.
“ES Track enables contractors and OEMs to make more informed decisions about their fleets through automated data collection,” said Schlacks. “Not only can contractors automate maintenance and job analytics, but they can also boost the ROI of their fleets by renting their
underutilized assets on the EquipmentShare marketplace.”
ES Track will also play a vital role in helping contractors comply with the upcoming ELD Mandate issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which will require all contractors to prove hours of service compliance using electronic logging devices by Dec. 2017. ES Track is a ready-made solution to this mandate and will enable contractors to comply easily while benefitting from ES Track’s innovative analytics and data for their fleets.
“EquipmentShare is quickly emerging as the gold standard telematics-connectivity platform and marketplace for the construction industry, changing the paradigm on how contractors operate their businesses,” said Harley Miller, vice president at Insight Venture Partners, who will join EquipmentShare’s board of directors. “We are pleased to add EquipmentShare to our portfolio of companies as they continue to outpace the competition and redefine a massive and growing industry.” 





EquipmentShare will also use this funding to expand its peer-to-peer marketplace locations. Currently available in four U.S. cities, EquipmentShare will launch in eight new markets in the South and Midwest in 2017. Contractors in these markets will be able to lend idle equipment for additional revenue or rent equipment at rates lower than traditional rental companies.
“EquipmentShare has become one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the nation. In the 18 months following our investment in their seed round, the company expanded into two new markets and developed a comprehensive telematics platform that will benefit contractors on an entirely new scale,” said Neil Chheda, co-founder and general partner at Romulus Capital. “EquipmentShare is a prime example of company that has taken the collaborative consumption model and evolved it into a more meaningful technology business.”
EquipmentShare will continue to expand its suite of solutions to help contractors use technology to more efficiently manage their fleets. For more information, visit www.equipmentshare.com.

TwoAlity, LLC

										by Olivia Gill - 
										June 15, 2015







Bailye and Brynne Stansberry are not typical entrepreneurs. They’re twins and just 22. They took a teenage idea and turned it into commercial reality.
The Stansberry Twins
While brainstorming a marketable product in a high school class one day, Bailye asked Brynne: “What do we wear?” The cold, dreary day outside prompted Brynne to contemplate the bright boots she preferred on rainy days. She wondered how they could make them more versatile. Together, they came up with boots with clear plastic uppers that would allow the wearer to insert different fabric liners — all-purpose boots for every mood. The boots would combine the water resistance of rain boots, the insulation of snow boots and the functional aspect of muck boots.
TwoAlity, LLC, which thus far sells the twins’ patented clear plastic boots with interchangeable liners online only, was launched in May 2013. Boots by TwoAlity, as the twins call their fun, unique product, was made possible by the care, attention and financial acumen of many individuals, including Jim Gann, the MU SBTDC’s director of technology business development. The twins had connected with Gann at a 2011 Regional Economic Development, Inc. idea bounce pitch competition at which they wowed the judges. They later found a California company that could make their boots. In early 2013, Gann, who lives in mid-Missouri and has made numerous industry contacts over the years, found a textile facility in Glasgow, American Discovery Textile Manufacturing, that could sew the liners.
And that’s important to the twins.
Growing up on a farm outside Moberly, they’ve witnessed first-hand the effects of the global economy on rural Missouri. Try as they might, however, they couldn’t find domestic manufacturers flexible enough to produce what they wanted at a price they could afford. The twins became convinced the boots and liners would have to be manufactured in China, Mexico or elsewhere, which presented a whole new set of headaches, not the least of which is quality control.
Creating jobs in America is more than giving back to the community, the twins say. Domestic manufacturers can scale manufacturing up or down far more quickly than overseas manufacturers, whose shipments can take weeks or even months. The twins forwent outside investors and kept their concept, recently securing an SBA loan to finance the launch.
As of late June 2013, TwoAlity is an online store only. The bright, intuitive website guides shoppers through the process: Choosing the right size of boots, then choosing liners in colors from berry to mellow yellow and basic black then choosing accessories. Because the liners can be printed with almost anything, in any color, licensing agreements represent a particularly fertile opportunity for the company.
“We’d love to have a Mizzou liner and a Cardinals liner!” Bailye says. She adds that sales are going very well.
But what is it like working with your twin?
“We have worked as a team all our lives and have perfected our teamwork to the point that we know how to work with and handle one another extremely well,” Bailye says. “On days that one of us is questioning our direction or future, the other one balances that negativity and brings everything back to usual. People looking in on our relationship are baffled by our ability to work as a team, and to be honest, most days we are too!”
Added Brynne, “Having Bailye by my side is one of the best parts about what we are doing. One industry consultant tried to tell us that instead of completing business tasks together, we should divide all the work — for example Bailye be the CFO and me the CEO. That is the worst advice anyone could ever give us. We do our best work when we work together. No matter how many people tell us how to make our relationship work, only we know how to do that and we are sticking with what we know. After all, we have been working together for 22 years.”

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
