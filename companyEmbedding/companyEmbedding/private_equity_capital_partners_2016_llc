	).


	Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Partnership may sell from time to time through the Manager, as the Partnerships sales agent,
	common units representing limited interests in the Partnership having an aggregate offering price of up to $50,000,000 (the 

	Common Units

	). Sales of the Common Units, if any, will be made be made by means of ordinary brokers
	transactions through the facilities of the NASDAQ Global Select Market (

	NASDAQ

	), any other national securities exchange or facility thereof, a trading facility of a national securities association or an alternate trading system,
	to or through a market maker or directly on or through an electronic communication network, a dark pool or any similar market venue, at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed between us and the Manager. The Agreement
	provides that the Manager, when it is acting as the Partnerships agent, will be entitled to compensation of up to 2% of the gross sales price of the Common Units sold through the Manager from time to time.

	offering expenses, for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, the acquisition of new vessels, the repayment or refinancing of all or a portion of the Partnerships outstanding indebtedness and funding of working
	capital requirements or capital expenditures.


	Under the terms of the Agreement, the Partnership may also sell Common Units from time to
	time to the Manager as principal for its own account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. Any sale of Common Units to the Manager as principal would be pursuant to the terms of a separate terms agreement between the Partnership and the
	Manager.


	The Common Units will be issued pursuant to the Partnerships Registration Statement on Form F-3 effective as of April 25,
	2016 (Registration No. 333-210394). The Partnership filed a prospectus supplement, dated September 12, 2016, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the offer and sale of the Common Units.

	one or more of the then issued Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under

	Prospectus or such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be; each Incorporated Document, at the time such document was filed with the Commission or at the time such document became
	effective, as applicable, complied, in all material respects, with the requirements of the Exchange Act and did not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in

	prepared, used or referred to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus except in compliance with Rules 164 and 433 under the Act; assuming that any such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus is so sent or given after the Registration Statement was filed
	with the Commission (and after such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus was, if required pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, filed with the Commission), the sending or giving, by the Manager, of any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus will satisfy
	the provisions of Rule 164 or Rule 433 (without reliance on subsections (b), (c) and (d) of Rule 164); the registration statement relating to the offering of the Units contemplated hereby, as initially filed with the Commission, includes a

	such qualification is required for the conduct of its business as described in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, except where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing would not,

	Material Adverse Effect

	) or

	SECTION 3. 

	Sale and Delivery of Securities

	.


	(a)       On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained,
	but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Partnership agrees to issue and sell through or to the Manager, as sales agent, and the Manager agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell, as sales agent for the
	Partnership, the Units on the following terms.


	(i)        The Units are to be
	sold on a daily basis or otherwise as shall be agreed to by the Partnership and the Manager on any day that (A) is a trading day for Nasdaq (as defined below) (a 

	Trading Day

	) (other than a Trading Day on which the Nasdaq
	Global Select Market (

	Nasdaq

	) is scheduled to close prior to its regular weekday closing time), (B) the Partnership has instructed the Manager by telephone (confirmed promptly by electronic mail) from any of the individuals
	listed as authorized representatives of the Partnership on

	Schedule


	 


	C

	hereto (as may be updated by the Partnership from time to time) (the 

	Authorized Partnership Representatives

	) to make such sales and
	(C) the Capital Parties have satisfied their obligations under Section 6 of this Agreement. The Partnership will designate the maximum number of Units to be sold by the Manager on any such day, as agreed to by the Manager (in any
	event not in excess of the amount of Units available for issuance under the Prospectus and the currently effective Registration Statement and not in excess of the amount of Units authorized from time to time to be issued and sold under this
	Agreement by the board of directors of the Partnership, or a duly authorized committee thereof, and the General Partner and notified to the Manager in writing) and the minimum price per Unit at which such Units may be sold (in any event not below
	the minimum price authorized from time to time under this Agreement by the board of directors of the Partnership, or a duly authorized committee thereof, and the General Partner and notified to the Manager in writing). Subject to the terms and
	conditions hereof, the Manager shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to offer and sell all of the Units designated on any day;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the Manager shall have no obligation to offer or sell any Units, and the
	Partnership acknowledges and agrees that the Manager shall have no such obligation, in the event an offer or sale of the Units on behalf of the Partnership may in the judgment of the Manager constitute the sale of a block under
	Rule 10b-18(a)(5) under the Exchange Act or a distribution within the meaning of Rule 100 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act or the Manager reasonably believes it may be deemed an underwriter under the Act in a
	transaction that is other than by means of ordinary brokers transactions between members of the Nasdaq that qualify for delivery of a Prospectus to the Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 153 under the Act (such ordinary brokers
	transactions are hereinafter referred to as 

	At the Market Offerings

	). The gross sales price of the Units sold under this Section 3(a) shall be the market price for the Partnerships Units sold by the Manager under this
	Section 3(a) at the time of sale of such Units.


	(ii)        The Partnership or
	the Manager may, upon notice to the other party hereto by telephone (confirmed promptly by electronic mail), suspend the offering of the Units for any reason and at any time;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that such suspension shall not affect or
	impair the parties respective obligations with respect to the Units sold


	 


	18






	hereunder prior to the giving of such notice. During any such period of suspension, the Partnership shall not be obligated to deliver (or cause to be delivered) any of the documents referred
	to in Sections 4(q) to 4(y), be deemed to affirm any of the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement pursuant to Sections 3.8(a)(viii) or 4(ee) hereof, or be obligated to conduct any due diligence session as referred to in
	Section 4(z) until the termination of the suspension and the recommencement of the offering of the Units pursuant to this Agreement (which recommencement shall constitute a Representation Date, as defined in Section 4(p)).


	(iii)        The Manager hereby covenants and agrees not to make any sales of the
	Units on behalf of the Partnership, pursuant to this Section 3(a), other than (A) by means of At the Market Offerings and (B) such other sales of the Units on behalf of the Partnership in its capacity as agent of the Partnership as
	shall be agreed by the Partnership, the General Partner and the Manager. The Manager shall not sell, and the Partnership shall not issue, fractional units.


	(iv)        The compensation to the Manager, as an agent of the Partnership, for
	sales of the Units shall be up to 2.0% of the gross sales price of the Units sold pursuant to this Section 3(a). The remaining proceeds, after further deduction for any transaction fees imposed by any governmental or self-regulatory
	organization in connection with such sales, shall constitute the net proceeds to the Partnership for such Units (the 

	Net Proceeds

	).


	(v)        The Manager shall provide written confirmation to the Partnership
	following the close of trading on Nasdaq each day in which the Units are sold under this Section 3(a) setting forth the aggregate amount of the Units sold on such day, the aggregate gross sale proceeds to the Partnership, the Net Proceeds to
	the Partnership, and the aggregate compensation payable by the Partnership to the Manager with respect to such sales.


	(vi)        Settlement for sales of the Units pursuant to this Section 3(a) will
	occur on the third Trading Day following the date on which such sales are made (provided that, if such third Trading Day is not a business day (as defined below), then settlement will occur on the next succeeding Trading Day that is also a business
	day), unless another date shall be agreed upon by the Partnership and the Manager (each such date, a 

	Settlement Date

	). As used in the preceding sentence and in Section 7 below, the term 

	business day

	
	means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in The City of New York are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. On each Settlement Date, the Units sold through the Manager
	for settlement on such date shall be issued and delivered by the Partnership to the Manager against payment of the Net Proceeds for the sale of such Units. Settlement for all such Units shall be effected by free delivery of the Units by the
	Partnership or its transfer agent to the Managers account, or to the account of the Managers designee, at The Depository Trust Company (

	DTC

	) through its Deposit and Withdrawal at Custodian System
	(

	DWAC

	) or by such other means of delivery as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto, which in all cases shall be freely tradable, transferable, registered Common Units eligible for delivery through DTC, in return for
	payments in


	 


	19






	same day funds delivered to the account designated by the Partnership. If the Partnership, or its transfer agent (if applicable), shall default on its obligation to deliver the Units on any
	Settlement Date, the Partnership shall (A) indemnify and hold the Manager harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Partnership and (B) pay the Manager any commission to which it would
	otherwise be entitled absent such default. If the Manager breaches this Agreement by failing to deliver the aggregate Net Proceeds to the Partnership on any Settlement Date for the Units delivered by the Partnership, the Manager will pay the
	Partnership interest based on the effective overnight federal funds rate on such unpaid amount. The Authorized Partnership Representatives shall be the contact persons for the Partnership for all matters related to the settlement of the
	transfer of the Units through DWAC for purposes of this Section 3(a)(vi).


	(vii)        Subject to the terms of a Terms Agreement, the Manager may sell the
	Units (i) by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Act, including without limitation sales made directly on any existing trading market for the Common Units, (ii) to or through a
	market maker, or (iii) directly on or through an electronic communication network, a dark pool or any similar market venue. Subject to the terms of a Terms Agreement, the Manager may also sell the Units by any other method permitted by
	law, including but not limited to in privately negotiated transactions.


	(viii)        At each Time of Sale, Settlement Date and Representation Date (as
	defined in Section 4(p)), the Capital Parties shall be deemed to have affirmed each representation and warranty contained in this Agreement as if such representation and warranty were made as of such date but modified to incorporate the
	disclosures contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, in each case as amended or supplemented as of such date. Any obligation of the Manager to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the
	Units on behalf of the Partnership shall be subject to the continuing accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Capital Parties herein, to the performance by the Capital Parties of their obligations hereunder and to the continuing
	satisfaction of the additional conditions specified in Section 6 of this Agreement.


	(b)        If the Partnership wishes to issue and sell the Units other than as set
	forth in Section 3(a) of this Agreement (each, a 

	Placement

	), it will notify the Manager of the proposed terms of such Placement. If the Manager, acting as principal, wishes to accept such proposed terms (which it may
	decline to do for any reason in its sole discretion) or, following discussions with the Partnership, wishes to accept amended terms, the Manager and the Partnership will enter into a Terms Agreement setting forth the terms of such Placement. In
	the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Terms Agreement, the terms of such Terms Agreement will control. The parties hereto agree that any entry into a Terms Agreement shall require the consent of the
	board of directors of the Partnership and the General Partner, and, in certain instances, CCC and CCOC.


	 


	20






	(c)        (i)        Under no circumstances
	shall the Partnership cause or request the offer or sale of any Units if, after giving effect to the sale of such Units, the aggregate gross sales proceeds or the aggregate number of the Units sold pursuant to this Agreement would exceed the lesser
	of (A) the amount set forth in Section 1, (B) the amount available for offer and sale under the currently effective Registration Statement and (C) the amount authorized from time to time to be issued and sold under this Agreement
	by the Partnerships board of directors, or a duly authorized committee thereof and the General Partner, and notified to the Manager in writing (in which case the Manager shall not sell any such Units). Under no circumstances shall the
	Partnership cause or request the offer or sale of any Units at a price lower than the minimum price authorized from time to time by the Partnerships board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof or the General Partner, and notified
	to the Manager in writing.


	(ii)        If either party has reason to believe that
	the exemptive provisions set forth in Rule 101(c)(1) of Regulation M under the Exchange Act are not satisfied with respect to the Units, it shall promptly notify the other party and sales of the Units under this Agreement shall be
	suspended until that or other exemptive provisions have been satisfied in the judgment of each party.


	(d)        Each sale of the Units to or through the Manager shall be made in
	accordance with the terms of this Agreement or, if applicable, a Terms Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Manager shall not purchase or sell pursuant to a Terms Agreement, and the Partnership shall not issue,
	fractional units.


	(e)        Subject to such further limitations on offers and
	sales of Units or delivery of instructions to offer and sell Units as are set forth herein and as may be mutually agreed upon by the Partnership and the Manager, offers and sales of Units pursuant to this Agreement shall not be requested by the
	Partnership and need not be made by the Manager at any time when or during any period in which the Partnership is or could be deemed to be in possession of material non-public information.


	(f)        The Capital Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) there can be no
	assurance that the Manager will be successful in selling the Units, (B) the Manager will incur no liability or obligation to the Partnership or any other person or entity if it does not sell Units for any reason other than a failure by the
	Manager to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulations to sell such Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (C) the Manager shall be under
	no obligation to purchase Units on a principal basis pursuant to this Agreement, except as otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the Manager and the Partnership.

	the Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not
	misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Prospectus (the term Prospectus for the purpose of this Section 7 being deemed to include any Basic Prospectus, any Prospectus
	Supplement, any Prospectus and any amendments or supplements to the foregoing), in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, in any issuer information (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) of the Partnership or in any Prospectus
	together with any combination of one or more of the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
	light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except, with respect to such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any
	untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning the Manager furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Manager to the Partnership expressly for use in, such Prospectus or
	Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not
	contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.


	(b)        The Manager agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Capital
	Parties, their directors and officers, and any person who controls the Capital Parties within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and
	against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Capital Parties or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise,
	insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue


	 


	32






	statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning the Manager furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Manager to the Partnership expressly for use in,
	the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post effective amendment thereof by the Capital Parties), or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Registration
	Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or
	(ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning the Manager furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Manager to the Capital Parties expressly for use in,
	the Prospectus Supplement or a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in the Prospectus Supplement or a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such
	information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.


	(c)        If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a 

	Proceeding

	)
	is brought against a person (an 

	indemnified party

	) in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Capital Parties or the Manager (as applicable, the 

	indemnifying party

	) pursuant to subsection (a) or
	(b), respectively, of this Section, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the
	employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any
	liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party or otherwise, unless such lack of notice substantially prejudices the indemnifying party as determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. The
	indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall
	have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel reasonably
	satisfactory to such indemnified party to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with
	those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall
	be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or
	series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written
	consent but, if settled


	 


	33






	with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such
	settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of
	this Section 7(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such
	indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given
	the indemnifying party at least 30 days prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened
	Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional written release of such indemnified party,
	in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such
	indemnified party.


	(d)        If the indemnification provided for in this
	Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to
	therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in order to provide for just and equitable contribution, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims
	(i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Capital Parties, on the one hand, and the Manager, on the other hand, from the offering of the Units or (ii) if the allocation provided by
	clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Capital Parties, on the one hand, and of
	the Manager, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
	Capital Parties, on the one hand, and the Manager, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of fees and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Partnership
	pursuant to this Agreement and any Terms Agreement, and the total fees and commissions received by the Manager pursuant to this Agreement and any Terms Agreement, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Units. The relative fault of
	the Capital Parties, on the one hand, and of the Manager, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to
	information supplied by the Capital Parties or by the Manager and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
	result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or


	 


	34






	expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.


	(e)        The Capital Parties and the Manager agree that it would not be just and
	equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d)
	above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, the Manager shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of commissions received by it under this Agreement and any Terms Agreement. No person guilty of fraudulent
	misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.


	(f)        The Capital Parties and the Manager agree promptly to notify each other of
	the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Capital Parties, against any of the their officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Units, or in connection with the Registration Statement, the Basic
	Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.


	SECTION 8. 

	Representations and
	Agreements to Survive Delivery

	. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Section 7 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Capital Parties contained in this Agreement or in certificates delivered pursuant
	hereto shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Manager or any of its affiliates or its or their directors, officers, employees or agents or any person (including each director, officer,
	employee or agent of such person) who controls the Manager within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Capital Parties, their directors or officers or any person who controls the
	Capital Parties within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Units.


	SECTION 9. 

	Termination

	.


	(a)        The Partnership shall have the right, by giving written notice as
	hereinafter specified, to terminate the provisions of this Agreement relating to the solicitation of offers to purchase the Units in its sole discretion at any time. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other
	party except that (i) if any of the Units have been sold through the Manager for the Partnership, then Section 4(bb) shall remain in full force and effect, (ii) with respect to any pending sale, through the Manager for the
	Partnership, the obligations of the Capital Parties, including in respect of compensation of the Manager, shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination and (iii) the provisions of Sections 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16,
	17, 18 and 19 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination.


	(b)        The Manager shall have the right, by giving written notice as hereinafter
	specified, to terminate the provisions of this Agreement relating to the solicitation of offers to purchase the Units in its sole discretion at any time. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except
	that the provisions of Sections


	 


	35






	5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination.


	(c)        This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless terminated
	pursuant to Sections 9(a) or (b) above or otherwise by mutual agreement of the parties;

	provided

	that any such termination by mutual agreement shall in all cases be deemed to provide that the provisions of Sections 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12,
	15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination.


	(d)        Any termination of this Agreement shall be effective on the date specified
	in such notice of termination;

	provided

	that such termination shall not be effective until the close of business on the date of receipt of such notice by the Manager or the Partnership, as the case may be. If such termination shall occur
	prior to the Settlement Date for any sale of the Units, such sale shall settle in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(a)(vi) of this Agreement.


	SECTION 10. 

	Notices

	. Except as otherwise herein provided, all statements, requests, notices and agreements under this
	Agreement shall be in writing and delivered by hand, overnight courier, mail or facsimile and, if to the Manager, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent to UBS Securities LLC, 1285 Avenue of the Americas New York, New York 10019,
	Attention: Legal Department (fax: (212) 821-4165), with a copy for information purposes to UBS Securities LLC, 677 Washington Blvd., Stamford, CT, 06901, Attention: Legal and Compliance Department, Fax No. (203) 719-0680 and, if to the
	Capital Parties, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent to the Partnership at 3 Iassonos Street, Piraeus 18537 Greece, attention of Gerasimos Kalogiratos. Each party to this Agreement may change such address for notices by
	sending to the parties to this Agreement written notice of a new address for such purpose.


	SECTION 11. 

	Parties at
	Interest

	. The Agreement herein set forth has been and is made solely for the benefit of the Manager and the Capital Parties and to the extent provided in Section 7 of this Agreement the controlling persons, partners, directors,
	officers, members, employees and agents referred to in such section, and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, personal representatives and executors and administrators. No other person, partnership, association or corporation (including
	a purchaser, as such purchaser, from the Manager) shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.


	SECTION
	12. 

	No Fiduciary Relationship

	. The Partnership hereby acknowledges that the Manager is acting solely as sales agent and/or principal in connection with the purchase and sale of the Partnerships securities. The Partnership
	further acknowledges that the Manager is acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arms length basis, and in no event do the parties intend that the Manager act or be responsible as a
	fiduciary to the Partnership, its management, stockholders or creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that the Manager may undertake or have undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Partnerships
	securities, either before or after the date hereof. The Manager hereby expressly disclaims any fiduciary or similar obligations to the Partnership, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading
	up to such transactions, and the Partnership hereby confirms its understanding and agreement to


	 


	36






	that effect. The Partnership and the Manager agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions and that any opinions or
	views expressed by the Manager to the Partnership regarding such transactions, including, but not limited to, any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Partnerships securities, do not constitute advice or
	recommendations to the Partnership. The Partnership hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Partnership may have against the Manager with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary
	or similar duty to the Partnership in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions.


	SECTION 13. 

	Adjustments for Unit Splits or Combinations

	. The parties acknowledge and agree that all unit related numbers
	contained in this Agreement shall be adjusted to take into account any unit split or combination or the like effected with respect to the Units.


	SECTION 14. 

	Entire Agreement

	. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior and
	contemporaneous agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof.


	SECTION 15. 

	Counterparts

	. This Agreement may be signed by the parties in one or more counterparts which together shall
	constitute one and the same agreement among the parties.


	SECTION 16. 

	Law; Construction

	. This Agreement and any claim,
	counterclaim or dispute of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement (

	Claim

	), directly or indirectly, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the
	State of New York.


	SECTION 17. 

	Headings

	. The Section headings in this Agreement have been inserted as a matter of
	convenience of reference and are not a part of this Agreement.


	SECTION 18. 

	Submission to Jurisdiction

	. Except as set
	forth below, no Claim may be commenced, prosecuted or continued in any court other than the courts of the State of New York located in the City and County of New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
	which courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the adjudication of such matters, and the Capital Parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and personal service with respect thereto. The Capital Parties hereby consent to personal
	jurisdiction, service and venue in any court in which any Claim arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement is brought by any third party against the Manager or any indemnified party. The Manager and each Capital Party (on its behalf
	and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its equityholders and affiliates) waive all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) in any way arising out of or
	relating to this Agreement. Each Capital Party agrees that a final judgment in any such action, proceeding or counterclaim brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon the Capital Parties and may be enforced in any other courts to
	the jurisdiction of which the Capital Parties are or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.


	SECTION 19. 

	Successors and
	Assigns

	. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Manager and the Capital Parties and their successors and assigns and any successor or assign of


	 


	37






	any substantial portion of the Capital Parties and the Managers respective businesses and/or assets.


	SECTION 20. 

	Miscellaneous

	. The Manager, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS AG, is not a bank and is separate from
	any affiliated bank, including any U.S. branch or agency of UBS AG. Because the Manager is a separately organized entity, it is solely responsible for its own contractual obligations and commitments, including obligations with respect to sales
	and purchases of securities. Securities sold, offered or recommended by the Manager are not deposits, are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are not guaranteed by a branch or agency, and are not otherwise an obligation or
	responsibility of a branch or agency.

	Registration Statement on Form F-3  Continuous Offering Program  Exhibit 5.1 Opinion



	 


	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as special counsel as to matters of the law of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (

	Marshall Islands Law

	) for Capital
	Product Partners L.P., a Marshall Islands limited partnership (the 

	Partnership

	), in connection with the offering by the Partnership of up to $50,000,000 in aggregate gross sales price of common units of the Partnership (the
	

	Common Units

	) pursuant to the Partnerships registration statement on Form F-3 (File No. 333-210394, the 

	Registration Statement

	) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities
	Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the 

	Securities Act

	). The Common Units are to be issued pursuant to an Equity Distribution Agreement (the 

	Distribution Agreement

	)
	dated September 12, 2016 among the Partnership, UBS Securities LLC, Capital GP L.L.C., Capital Product Operating L.L.C., Crude Carriers Corp., Crude Carriers Operating Corp. and Capital Ship Management Corp.


	In rendering this opinion, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of the following:


	 




	(i)



	the Registration Statement, the base prospectus filed on April 26, 2016 (the 

	Base Prospectus

	) and the
	prospectus supplement filed the date hereof (the 

	Prospectus Supplement

	);





	 




	(ii)



	the Distribution Agreement; and





	 




	(iii)



	such other papers, documents, agreements and certificates of public officials and representatives of the Partnership as
	we have deemed relevant and necessary as the basis for the opinion hereafter expressed.

	In such examination, we have assumed (i) the legal capacity of each natural person, (ii) the
	genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, (iii) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as conformed or photostatic copies, (iv) that the documents reviewed by us
	in connection with the rendering of the opinion set forth herein are true, correct and complete and (v) the truthfulness of each statement as to all factual matters contained in any document or certificate encompassed within the due diligence review
	undertaken by us. As to matters of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, we have relied upon the aforesaid certificates. We have not independently verified the facts so relied on.


	In rendering this opinion, we have also assumed (x) that the Common Units shall be issued and sold in compliance with (i) the Securities Act, (ii) all
	other applicable U.S. federal and state securities and other laws, and (iii) the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Distribution Agreement and all of the
	instruments and other documents relating thereto or executed in connection therewith; (y) that the Distribution Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto (other than the Partnership, Capital GP
	L.L.C., Capital Product Operating L.L.C., Crude Carriers Corp., and Crude Carriers Operating Corp.); and (z) the validity and enforceability of the Distribution Agreement against the parties thereto.


	We have assumed that the Common Units will be issued at or above the price authorized by the Partnership, and that fractional units will not be issued.


	This opinion letter is limited to Marshall Islands Law. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise of any development or circumstance
	of any kind, including any change of law or fact that may occur after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinion expressed herein.


	Based on the facts as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, and having regard to legal
	considerations which we deem relevant, and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that when the Common Units are issued and delivered against payment therefor in accordance with the terms
	of the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Distribution Agreement, the Common Units will be validly issued, fully paid (to the extent required under the Partnership Agreement) and nonassessable (except as
	such nonassessability may be affected by Sections 30, 41, 51 and 60 of the Marshall Islands Limited Partnership Act).

Our Story









Making Businesses Better Since 1991
For over two decades, the Partners of KPS have worked exclusively to acquire and improve businesses that manufacture a diverse array of products across a broad number of industries. 

KPS has developed a unique investment strategy that has consistently resulted in the creation of world-class, industry-leading companies.  KPS’ investment strategy has resulted in meaningful value creation in its portfolio companies for the benefit of its investors, management teams and the Firm across economic and business cycles.  

KPS has completed over 60 controlling investments through four institutional investment funds, comprising over 30 platform investments and over 30 follow-on acquisitions in industries including basic materials, branded consumer, healthcare and luxury products, automotive parts, capital equipment and general manufacturing. 

KPS has experienced substantial growth over the past two decades.  KPS began as an investor exclusively focused on North American companies, with an exclusively U.S. investor base.  KPS is now a global Firm with the ability to execute and create value world-wide, with an investor base from 18 countries.  

KPS has benefited from the continuity of its Partners and senior investment professionals.  Michael Psaros and David Shapiro, two of the three co-Founders of KPS, continue to lead the Firm and, along with Partners Raquel Palmer and Jay Bernstein, are personally involved in every aspect of the Firm’s investment activities, including direct engagement with its portfolio companies and their management teams.  This continuity has created and fostered the culture of a family-owned Firm that is grounded in the core values of the KPS Partners, including integrity, veracity and transparency. 

KPS has also maintained the complete continuity of its investment strategy and core focus.  The Firm’s singular focus will always be developing world-class, industry-leading manufacturing companies.

The collective experience of the KPS team over two decades has provided us with a demonstrated ability to see value where other investors do not and to make businesses better.

Private Equity
Putting Capital to Work, Making Companies Stronger.





Overview Our investments span a wide range of industries around the world in established and growth-oriented businesses alike. Playing a vital role in helping companies realize their growth potential, we uncover value by identifying great companies and enhancing their performance by providing patient capital and operating support to strong management teams. Our approach helps our portfolio companies grow core businesses, launch new initiatives, make transformative acquisitions and upgrade technologies and systems to support their long-term strategy.   
We provide more than just capital. We seek to make the companies we invest in stronger through a bottoms-up strategy of transformation. Crucially, we bring the expertise of our Portfolio Operations Group to provide strategic guidance on a variety of operational improvements, including revenue growth, procurement, leadership development, lean process and IT optimization, energy sustainability, and employee health care.
  







				A Message from Joe Baratta, Global Head of Private Equity
			










DRIVING
Transformative Impact  We strive to create value by investing in great businesses where our capital, strategic insight, global relationships and operational support can drive transformation that unlocks the company’s potential. In addition to benefiting our investors, the improvements in growth and global competitiveness benefit workers, communities and other stakeholders. 
We are patient investors who practice the art of the long view, and are committed to achieving the best long-term outcomes for our businesses and our investors. 
 


DISCIPLINED
Due Diligence  Our investment approach is based on a disciplined due diligence process that measures risk while identifying the catalysts for increased value. We purposefully engage only in friendly transactions and work with talented management teams to achieve transformative results. Our specialized Portfolio Operations Group helps to maximize value by improving processes across varied elements of a business’s operations.    
The returns that these investments earn for our investors – pension funds, academic and charitable institutions, governments and other institutions, as well as retail investors – help to secure and grow the assets needed to support retirees and fund essential programs.

“ “We are constantly looking for situations where we see something, or we are able to add value in a way that our competitors don't. Our people feel the obligation to go out there and find special situations where we can intervene to drive change.”  - Joseph Baratta Global Head of Private Equity   











   
Pro-active, targeted sourcing  Sector-based, theme-driven deal sourcing is the primary responsibility and mandate of our investment professionals. We aim to source high-quality and proprietary investment opportunities by proactively developing and leveraging strong relationships with companies and key deal intermediaries. At regular pipeline meetings with sector teams, we review potential opportunities and determine what resources – both internal and external – are best suited to pursue those opportunities.  




   
Value-oriented discipline In determining value for new investments, we focus on a business’s current outlook and judge the predictability of that outlook over time, while also factoring in what we can do for the business to drive even better outcomes after our acquisition. 
  




   
Transformational operating improvements 
We actively target companies in which significant value can be created through clear strategic and operational change, and created our Portfolio Operations Group to provide hands-on support to help our portfolio companies become more productive, efficient and valuable. Once a company joins the portfolio, we help management craft a plan to reach their full potential over the long term, and provide assistance as they put this plan into practice.

Traditional Leveraged Buyouts 

We pursue control leveraged buyouts of both large and mid-cap companies globally

                Our large buyouts tend to be in companies of global scale with strong brands and high relative market shares, where we can still drive growth and operating improvements.  Our mid-cap buyouts tend to be of companies that are differentiated vs. larger competitors and have protected market niches and multiple avenues of growth and operating improvements.

Buy and Build Platforms

Smaller companies, scalable platforms, backable management teams
