Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-0.15      Market Cap $3.28 M     Shares Outstanding 54.73 M     Public Float 26.55 M     Yield MLFB has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.

Major League Football (MLFB) is a proposed professional American football league based in Lakewood Ranch, Florida; it currently consists of eight announced teams[1] and all teams are league-owned.[2] The league founder and president is former National Football League wide receiver Wes Chandler. Major League Football, Inc., is a publicly traded company. In June 2016, eviction papers were served to the league for non-payment of rent beginning in March 2016 on its offices at the Lakewood Ranch facility.[3] There have been no official updates by the league since March 31, 2016.

League history[edit]
Major League Football was founded in December 2014 with the intention of a being a spring football league in an attempt to fill the void left by minor or development football leagues such as the World Football League, the United States Football League, the XFL and United Football League (all of which lasted less than five years), and the current Fall Experimental Football League (FXFL). The league looked to establish teams in unrecognized U.S. markets such as Birmingham, AL, Memphis, TN, Las Vegas, NV, Orlando, FL, Portland, OR, Sacramento, CA, and San Antonio, TX.[4] It also planned to develop a non-conflicting and competitive league to the National Football League and other sports leagues in the United States (including the Arena Football League and Indoor Football League) and expand the media platform.[5]
The MLFB is a single-entity business model where the league owns and operates all of the teams with franchises in cities that are absent of NFL or Major League Baseball teams. The MLFB's goal is to have franchises be individual owner and operated by 2019 or 2020. Average attendance is expected to be between 12,500 and 15,000 fans by the end of the first season and run from April to July.[6]
The MLFB originally planned on having its inaugural season in spring 2016. In January 2016, the MLFB held a draft for eight teams based on territory. However, in February 2016, a major financial backer of the league backed out of a $20 million commitment putting the league's first season in jeopardy.[7] The league continued to push forward in an attempt to start games in April 2016, but the league was unable to come up with the needed financials in order to operate a full season. On March 31, the league announced that the first season would be postponed and 2016 would be considered a "developmental" year.[8] However, by June 2016, the league would miss at least four months of rent payments on its headquarters in Lakewood Ranch, Florida, and were served with an eviction notice.[3]
In early 2017, the league registered websites for some of their teams that listed eight teams in the league: Alabama Airbourne,[9] Arkansas Attack,[10] Florida Fusion,[10] Ohio Union,[11] Oklahoma Nation,[10] Oregon Crash,[12] Texas Independence,[13] and Virginia Armada.[10]
Rules differences[edit]
The rules of the MLFB are basically the same as the NFL with a few differences such as:[14]

A 30-second play clock instead of the NFL's 40 seconds.
50-yard field goals being worth 4 points (former NFL Europe rule).
The ground can cause a fumble.
In the case of overtime, a 10-minute period will be played to determine a winner. Similar to former NFL rules, first score wins the game. In the event the game is still tied after overtime, there are alternating possessions from the 10-yard line; teams get four plays to score a touchdown and 2-point conversion.

Potential teams[edit]
While currently unannounced, the MLFB has filed trademarks for ten regional teams and have held a territorial draft for eight teams in which coaches draft based on region. The reported names are:[15]

Alabama Airborne
Arkansas Attack
Florida Fusion
Northwest Empire
Ohio Union
Oklahoma Nation
Oregon Crash[16]
Texas Independence
Utah Stand
Virginia Armada[17]

League history[edit]
Major League Football was founded in December 2014 with the intention of a being a spring football league in an attempt to fill the void left by minor or development football leagues such as the World Football League, the United States Football League, the XFL and United Football League (all of which lasted less than five years), and the current Fall Experimental Football League (FXFL). The league looked to establish teams in unrecognized U.S. markets such as Birmingham, AL, Memphis, TN, Las Vegas, NV, Orlando, FL, Portland, OR, Sacramento, CA, and San Antonio, TX.[4] It also planned to develop a non-conflicting and competitive league to the National Football League and other sports leagues in the United States (including the Arena Football League and Indoor Football League) and expand the media platform.[5]
The MLFB is a single-entity business model where the league owns and operates all of the teams with franchises in cities that are absent of NFL or Major League Baseball teams. The MLFB's goal is to have franchises be individual owner and operated by 2019 or 2020. Average attendance is expected to be between 12,500 and 15,000 fans by the end of the first season and run from April to July.[6]
The MLFB originally planned on having its inaugural season in spring 2016. In January 2016, the MLFB held a draft for eight teams based on territory. However, in February 2016, a major financial backer of the league backed out of a $20 million commitment putting the league's first season in jeopardy.[7] The league continued to push forward in an attempt to start games in April 2016, but the league was unable to come up with the needed financials in order to operate a full season. On March 31, the league announced that the first season would be postponed and 2016 would be considered a "developmental" year.[8] However, by June 2016, the league would miss at least four months of rent payments on its headquarters in Lakewood Ranch, Florida, and were served with an eviction notice.[3]
In early 2017, the league registered websites for some of their teams that listed eight teams in the league: Alabama Airbourne,[9] Arkansas Attack,[10] Florida Fusion,[10] Ohio Union,[11] Oklahoma Nation,[10] Oregon Crash,[12] Texas Independence,[13] and Virginia Armada.[10]
Rules differences[edit]
The rules of the MLFB are basically the same as the NFL with a few differences such as:[14]

A 30-second play clock instead of the NFL's 40 seconds.
50-yard field goals being worth 4 points (former NFL Europe rule).
The ground can cause a fumble.
In the case of overtime, a 10-minute period will be played to determine a winner. Similar to former NFL rules, first score wins the game. In the event the game is still tied after overtime, there are alternating possessions from the 10-yard line; teams get four plays to score a touchdown and 2-point conversion.

Potential teams[edit]
While currently unannounced, the MLFB has filed trademarks for ten regional teams and have held a territorial draft for eight teams in which coaches draft based on region. The reported names are:[15]

Alabama Airborne
Arkansas Attack
Florida Fusion
Northwest Empire
Ohio Union
Oklahoma Nation
Oregon Crash[16]
Texas Independence
Utah Stand
Virginia Armada[17]

On March 31, the league announced that the first season would be postponed and 2016 would be considered a "developmental" year.[8] However, by June 2016, the league would miss at least four months of rent payments on its headquarters in Lakewood Ranch, Florida, and were served with an eviction notice.[3]
In early 2017, the league registered websites for some of their teams that listed eight teams in the league: Alabama Airbourne,[9] Arkansas Attack,[10] Florida Fusion,[10] Ohio Union,[11] Oklahoma Nation,[10] Oregon Crash,[12] Texas Independence,[13] and Virginia Armada.[10]
Rules differences[edit]
The rules of the MLFB are basically the same as the NFL with a few differences such as:[14]

A 30-second play clock instead of the NFL's 40 seconds.
50-yard field goals being worth 4 points (former NFL Europe rule).
The ground can cause a fumble.
In the case of overtime, a 10-minute period will be played to determine a winner. Similar to former NFL rules, first score wins the game. In the event the game is still tied after overtime, there are alternating possessions from the 10-yard line; teams get four plays to score a touchdown and 2-point conversion.

Potential teams[edit]
While currently unannounced, the MLFB has filed trademarks for ten regional teams and have held a territorial draft for eight teams in which coaches draft based on region. The reported names are:[15]

Alabama Airborne

League history[edit]
Major League Football was founded in December 2014 with the intention of a being a spring football league in an attempt to fill the void left by minor or development football leagues such as the World Football League, the United States Football League, the XFL and United Football League (all of which lasted less than five years), and the current Fall Experimental Football League (FXFL). The league looked to establish teams in unrecognized U.S. markets such as Birmingham, AL, Memphis, TN, Las Vegas, NV, Orlando, FL, Portland, OR, Sacramento, CA, and San Antonio, TX.[4] It also planned to develop a non-conflicting and competitive league to the National Football League and other sports leagues in the United States (including the Arena Football League and Indoor Football League) and expand the media platform.[5]
The MLFB is a single-entity business model where the league owns and operates all of the teams with franchises in cities that are absent of NFL or Major League Baseball teams. The MLFB's goal is to have franchises be individual owner and operated by 2019 or 2020. Average attendance is expected to be between 12,500 and 15,000 fans by the end of the first season and run from April to July.[6]
The MLFB originally planned on having its inaugural season in spring 2016. In January 2016, the MLFB held a draft for eight teams based on territory. However, in February 2016, a major financial backer of the league backed out of a $20 million commitment putting the league's first season in jeopardy.[7] The league continued to push forward in an attempt to start games in April 2016, but the league was unable to come up with the needed financials in order to operate a full season. On March 31, the league announced that the first season would be postponed and 2016 would be considered a "developmental" year.[8] However, by June 2016, the league would miss at least four months of rent payments on its headquarters in Lakewood Ranch, Florida, and were served with an eviction notice.[3]
In early 2017, the league registered websites for some of their teams that listed eight teams in the league: Alabama Airbourne,[9] Arkansas Attack,[10] Florida Fusion,[10] Ohio Union,[11] Oklahoma Nation,[10] Oregon Crash,[12] Texas Independence,[13] and Virginia Armada.[10]
Rules differences[edit]
The rules of the MLFB are basically the same as the NFL with a few differences such as:[14]

A 30-second play clock instead of the NFL's 40 seconds.
50-yard field goals being worth 4 points (former NFL Europe rule).
The ground can cause a fumble.
In the case of overtime, a 10-minute period will be played to determine a winner. Similar to former NFL rules, first score wins the game. In the event the game is still tied after overtime, there are alternating possessions from the 10-yard line; teams get four plays to score a touchdown and 2-point conversion.

Potential teams[edit]
While currently unannounced, the MLFB has filed trademarks for ten regional teams and have held a territorial draft for eight teams in which coaches draft based on region. The reported names are:[15]

Alabama Airborne
Arkansas Attack
Florida Fusion
Northwest Empire
