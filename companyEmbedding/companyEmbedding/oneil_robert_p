Deepest Sympathy to the O'Neill family. I was so sorry to hear about Robert's illness, he was much to young to be taken away from you all. I hope your memories can eventually bring you peace and laughter. We were friends many years ago Bob was very smart and talented in school, I don't think he realized how smart he was.

I hope your memories can eventually bring you peace and laughter.  We were friends many years ago Bob was very smart and talented in school, I don't think he realized how smart he was. I cannot stop thinking about the time he played Scrooge in a play at Mountview, he was so good and he would sing at the top of his lungs just like Mrs. O'Neill did at CCD! I hope he's watching down on you all and saying "I did a good job" Peace to you. Cathy

Dear Teri and family,         So very sorry for your loss.  Homa was certainly unique and listened to a different drummer. He was the greatest dancer and would always pick me to dance with him at Greendales.  Loved him.  We now have another angle looking over all of us for sure.  May God keep you in his grip.

Christine & Randy -       My wife and I are saddened to hear the news about your dad.  Losing a family member is never the easiest situation to deal with.  But I will assure you that it's only a temporary separation. There are no goodbyes.  Only see you laters, and I'm confident that he left a proud dad knowing he raised great daughter.    God Bless you and your entire family.    Warmest Regards,    Joe & Jen Ricard

Rob O’Neill is one of the most highly-decorated combat veterans of our time and the author of the New York Times best-selling memoir The Operator: Firing the Shots That Killed Osama bin Laden and My Years as a SEAL Team Warrior. A former SEAL Team Six leader with the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, he deployed more than a dozen times and held combat leadership roles in more than 400 combat missions in four different theaters of war. A highly-trained Navy SEAL, he led the military’s most elite and was involved in our nation’s most important campaigns. With most of his career shrouded in a classified cloak, O’Neill was the man on the ground we have never heard of but know exists. He was one of the quiet professionals performing the most difficult tasks in the most difficult circumstances, serving his remarkable career in the shadows and keeping America safe in the process. He is currently a contributor to Fox News.
In the world of high-pressure Navy SEAL missions, instant, critical decision-making is a necessity for success. He has proven experience in exceptionally high-risk and fluid environments. Having trained more than 800 special operations and tactical operators, O’Neill brings this unique expertise to organizations and translates his elite SEAL team training into high-impact, actionable insights on leadership, decision-making, operating in uncertain environments, and how to become the ‘best of the best.’ Exclusively represented by Leading Authorities speakers bureau, his mantra is “never quit,” and he believes this is the single most important factor in determining success. O’Neill reminds us that the servicemen doing the dirtiest work are often making the hardest sacrifices.
Decorations. One of the nation’s most decorated veterans, O’Neill has been decorated more than 52 times with honors, including two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars with Valor, a Joint Service Commendation Medal with Valor, three Presidential Unit citations, and two Navy/Marine Corps Commendations with Valor. Silver Stars, the military’s third highest honor, are awarded for extraordinary gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States. Bronze Stars with Valor are awarded for merit, with Valor signifying a heroic act and direct participation in combat operations. It is the fourth-highest combat award of the U.S. Armed Forces and the ninth highest military award overall. Joint Service Commendation Medals are given for senior service on a joint military staff and is the most senior of the commendation medals.   
Military History. O’Neill rose to the rank of senior chief petty officer in the United States Navy and served as a team leader at DEVGRU, positions not come by easily. O’Neill has a laundry list of certifications, including instructor, physical trainer, master training specialist, special warfare sniper and breacher, diving supervisor, and survival expert. He was also an officer in charge of small arms, demolition, close quarters combat, explosives breaching, fire and maneuvers, and laser systems safety. His military air operations qualifications include high-altitude and high-opening free fall jump master, tandem and bundle master, parachute rigger, master naval parachutist, drop zone safety officer, and air operations trainer/examiner and quality assurance inspector. He has completed more than 1000 jumps.
Since leaving active duty, O’Neill is a co-founder of Your Grateful Nation, which provides individualized transition support for Special Operations heroes and their families. They provide executive-level mentoring, transition services, and family stabilization support.   Continue Reading »

The Operator












Never Quit: The Story of a Life Built on Successful Missions. Rob O’Neill served America as a Navy SEAL, team leader, and senior chief petty officer with the Naval Special Development Group (SEAL Team Six) during several of the most challenging, storied, and clandestine military operations of our time. With this speech, O’Neill shares what he learned during his more than 400 combat missions across four theaters of war. Through his moving and emotional stories, Rob brings to life lessons learned during some of the country’s most headline-stealing conflicts. O’Neill explains to audiences how the best of the military’s best approach strategic planning when mission failure is not an option. Audiences come to appreciate the people who are asked to do the hardest jobs – the warriors, husbands and wives, and family men and women – who they know exist but have never met, and who are focused solely on making their missions successful. Join one of the legends of our nation’s military as he shares his views on the ingredients to a successful mission: the right people, preparedness, decision making under pressure, and, above all, a commitment to never quit.

            Clients say        





                        Robert did an excellent job and was just awesome. Our attendees LOVED him and gave him two standing rounds. Of course, our group are farmers/ranchers and are very supportive of the military. His message on leadership and how to persevere was also awesome and he does a great job of presenting. He answered questions and everyone loved him.
Highly recommend. Of course, now the bar is set for next year!!!

                        For the record, Rob was a huge hit at our party. Everybody really enjoyed his speech, and he was very generous with his time after he finished speaking. He talked to everybody, posed for pictures, had dinner with us, drinks afterwards, etc.                     


Sun & Fun Media, LLC





                        
No one word can describe the excitement, emotions and energy our attendee’s experienced during and after his presentation. It’s still a big topic of conversation in our organization and interestingly I’ve heard from many who were not in attendance but wished that had been invited. Rob’s ability to share his experiences and correlate them to what we face in the business world was well received by the audience. His friendly demeanor from the time he arrived (pre event) to the photo opportunities with our teams left such a great impression. The one on one time with Rob was a lifetime experience. As one of the participants said, “he’s a guy that you’d just want to have as a friend, regardless of his background”. A true American Hero, whose message of “Never Quit”, will resonate with our team for years to come.
                    







                        “Rob did an exceptional job! Great presentation and message. He interacted with our employees extremely well. The photo session was great and he spent quite a bit of time with us in the private event. Great guy. If you did not know who he was, he'd be a guy you'd want as a friend!”                    


Aspen Manufacturing





                        “Just wanted to touch base with you on Rob O’Neill. He was beyond amazing. We’ve never had a keynote who has been given a standing ovation. His presentation was interesting, funny, engaging…I could go on and on. Our CFO, who is rarely happy with anything, was blown away by his presentation and said he’s never heard a speaker as good as Rob and that he could have listened to him for hours. In addition, Rob could not have been more gracious or engaging to our staff and attendees. I only wish that I could have spent some time talking to him because I am also from Montana but I wanted to make sure our attendees had access to him. Can you please let him know what a huge hit he was, how excited we are that he was a part of NextLevel and tell him Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!”                    


SciQuest





                        "Rob O’Neil walked in like “they guy next door” and left a Rock Star.  In the 19 years I have been doing this, no one has ever gotten a standing ovation.  It took me 40 minutes to get him out the door because so many people want to get their picture taken with him and shake his hand.  Frankly, I have never witness our group reacting this way.  Several people stated to me that he was our “best speaker ever!”  That is very high praise indeed."

Robert J. "Rob" O'Neill (born April 10, 1976) is a former United States Navy sailor. A former U.S. Navy SEAL and special warfare operator, O'Neill is best known for claiming to have fired the head shots that killed Osama bin Laden during the raid on his Abbottabad compound on May 1, 2011.[2]

Early life[edit]
O'Neill was born and raised in Butte, Montana.[3] In his youth, his father, Tom, took him hunting and taught him sharpshooting. In 1995, at age 19, a year after graduating from Butte Central Catholic High School,[4] O'Neill joined the U.S. Navy hoping to become a sniper.[5][6]
Career[edit]
O'Neill initially sought to become a sniper and enlist as a U.S. Marine where he had known some friends. On the day he arrived at the recruitment office, the Marine recruiter was not in. Instead, a Navy recruiter suggested that O'Neill enlist in the U.S. Navy, telling him that he could be a sniper in the U.S. Navy SEALs.[7]
As a member of the U.S. Navy, O'Neill was reportedly involved in more than 400 missions,[8] including the mission to save Captain Richard Phillips during the Maersk Alabama hijacking, and Operation Red Wings in which O'Neill helped save Marcus Luttrell.[5] On 11 occasions during his career, O'Neill left home thinking he would not return alive.[9]
In 2012, after 16 years of service, and 4 years shy of retirement, O'Neill left the U.S. Navy. When asked about his decision to leave the Navy before the 20-year retirement mark, O'Neill shared that it was a difficult choice, but that ultimately he did it for his family.[10] He is now a public speaker employed by Leading Authorities, a speakers bureau.[11] O'Neill was hired as a contributor for Fox News Channel in 2015 to lend "his military expertise across the cable channel’s daytime and primetime programs."[12]
O'Neill rose to the rank of Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator (E-8). His 52 decorations include two Silver Stars, four Bronze Star Medals with Valor device, a Joint Service Commendation Medal with Valor device, three Presidential Unit citations, and two Navy and Marine Corps Commendations with Valor device.[13]
In 2017, O'Neill published The Operator, in which he describes his deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, life as a Navy SEAL, and killing Osama bin Laden.[14]
Claims about participation in Operation Neptune Spear[edit]
The claims that O'Neill killed bin Laden came on October 5, 2014, in anticipation of a Fox News special called The Man Who Killed Osama bin Laden,[15] which was expected to reveal his identity and details of the mission Operation Neptune Spear. He had previously been interviewed anonymously in an Esquire magazine article in February 2013.[16][17]
O'Neill's statements resulted in criticism by fellow Navy SEALs. Rear admiral Brian Losey and Force Master Chief Michael Magaraci issued a public statement,

A critical tenant  [sic] of our ethos is "I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions."[18]

In 2012, Matt Bissonette, using the pseudonym "Mark Owen", wrote a book called No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission that Killed Osama bin Laden documenting his participation in the raid. In his book, he does not identify the man who fired the fatal shots at Bin Laden, referring to him as simply the "Point Man". Bisonnette himself admits to firing his weapon at Bin Laden after the fatal shots were fired by the "Point Man" when Bin Laden was already "In his death throes."[19] He has, however, refused to respond directly to O'Neill's claims, adding that he believed the team effort was more important than one person pulling the trigger.[20] The United States Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into whether Bissonnette leaked classified material.[15][21][not in citation given] O'Neill has also been criticized by other former Navy SEALs for disclosing his role.[18]

Robert J. "Rob" O'Neill (born April 10, 1976) is a former United States Navy sailor. A former U.S. Navy SEAL and special warfare operator, O'Neill is best known for claiming to have fired the head shots that killed Osama bin Laden during the raid on his Abbottabad compound on May 1, 2011.[2]

Early life[edit]
O'Neill was born and raised in Butte, Montana.[3] In his youth, his father, Tom, took him hunting and taught him sharpshooting. In 1995, at age 19, a year after graduating from Butte Central Catholic High School,[4] O'Neill joined the U.S. Navy hoping to become a sniper.[5][6]
Career[edit]
O'Neill initially sought to become a sniper and enlist as a U.S. Marine where he had known some friends. On the day he arrived at the recruitment office, the Marine recruiter was not in. Instead, a Navy recruiter suggested that O'Neill enlist in the U.S. Navy, telling him that he could be a sniper in the U.S. Navy SEALs.[7]
As a member of the U.S. Navy, O'Neill was reportedly involved in more than 400 missions,[8] including the mission to save Captain Richard Phillips during the Maersk Alabama hijacking, and Operation Red Wings in which O'Neill helped save Marcus Luttrell.[5] On 11 occasions during his career, O'Neill left home thinking he would not return alive.[9]
In 2012, after 16 years of service, and 4 years shy of retirement, O'Neill left the U.S. Navy. When asked about his decision to leave the Navy before the 20-year retirement mark, O'Neill shared that it was a difficult choice, but that ultimately he did it for his family.[10] He is now a public speaker employed by Leading Authorities, a speakers bureau.[11] O'Neill was hired as a contributor for Fox News Channel in 2015 to lend "his military expertise across the cable channel’s daytime and primetime programs."[12]
O'Neill rose to the rank of Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator (E-8). His 52 decorations include two Silver Stars, four Bronze Star Medals with Valor device, a Joint Service Commendation Medal with Valor device, three Presidential Unit citations, and two Navy and Marine Corps Commendations with Valor device.[13]
In 2017, O'Neill published The Operator, in which he describes his deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, life as a Navy SEAL, and killing Osama bin Laden.[14]
Claims about participation in Operation Neptune Spear[edit]
The claims that O'Neill killed bin Laden came on October 5, 2014, in anticipation of a Fox News special called The Man Who Killed Osama bin Laden,[15] which was expected to reveal his identity and details of the mission Operation Neptune Spear. He had previously been interviewed anonymously in an Esquire magazine article in February 2013.[16][17]
O'Neill's statements resulted in criticism by fellow Navy SEALs. Rear admiral Brian Losey and Force Master Chief Michael Magaraci issued a public statement,

A critical tenant  [sic] of our ethos is "I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions."[18]

In 2012, Matt Bissonette, using the pseudonym "Mark Owen", wrote a book called No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission that Killed Osama bin Laden documenting his participation in the raid. In his book, he does not identify the man who fired the fatal shots at Bin Laden, referring to him as simply the "Point Man". Bisonnette himself admits to firing his weapon at Bin Laden after the fatal shots were fired by the "Point Man" when Bin Laden was already "In his death throes."[19] He has, however, refused to respond directly to O'Neill's claims, adding that he believed the team effort was more important than one person pulling the trigger.[20] The United States Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into whether Bissonnette leaked classified material.[15][21][not in citation given] O'Neill has also been criticized by other former Navy SEALs for disclosing his role.[18]
