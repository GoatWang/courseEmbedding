The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Portfolio. The table does not reflect the fees and expenses of AllianzIM Funds or Variable Contracts (each as defined below) through which investors may invest indirectly into the Portfolio. If it did, expenses would be higher. Shareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment): None Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment) Distribution and/or Service (12b-1) Fees Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses Management Other Expense Portfolio Fees Expenses Reductions (1) NFJ Dividend Value 0.70% 0.25% 0.22% 1.17% (0.17)% 1.00% Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses After Expense Reductions (1) (1) Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses After Expense Reductions reflect the effect of two contractual arrangements entered into by Allianz Global Investors Fund Management LLC (the Manager ). Pursuant to the first arrangement, the Manager has contractually agreed to observe, through April 30, 2017, an irrevocable waiver of a portion of its management fee, which reduces the contractual rate by 0.05%, from 0.70% to 0.65%. Under the second arrangement, the Manager has entered into an Expense Limitation Agreement with the Trust, under which the Manager has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse the Portfolio through April 30, 2017 to the extent that Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses, excluding interest, tax, extraordinary expenses and certain credits and other expenses (after giving effect to the management fee waiver referred to in the preceding sentence), exceed 1.00% for the Portfolio. Under the Expense Limitation Agreement, the Manager may recoup waived or reimbursed amounts for three years, provided total expenses, including such recoupment, do not exceed the annual expense limit in effect at the time of such waiver/reimbursement or recoupment. The Expense Limitation Agreement is terminable by the Trust upon 90 days prior written notice to the Manager or at any time by mutual agreement of the parties. Examples. The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in shares of the Portfolio with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in Portfolio shares for the time periods indicated, your investment has a 5% return each year, and the Portfolio s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, the Examples show what your costs would be based on these assumptions. The Examples are based, for the first year, on Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses After Expense Reductions and, for all other periods, on Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses. These Examples do not take into account the fees and expenses of AllianzIM Funds or Variable Contracts through which investors may invest indirectly into the Portfolio. If they did, expenses would be higher. Portfolio 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 10 Years NFJ Dividend Value $102 $355 $627 $1,405 Portfolio Turnover. The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). The Portfolio s portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 was 49% of the average value of its portfolio. High levels of portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses or in the Examples above, can adversely affect the Portfolio s investment performance. Principal Investment Strategies The Portfolio seeks to achieve its investment objective by normally investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings made for investment purposes) in common stocks and other equity securities of companies that pay or are expected to pay dividends. Under normal conditions, the Portfolio will invest primarily in common stocks of companies with market capitalizations greater than $3.5 billion. The portfolio managers use a value investing style focusing on companies whose securities the portfolio managers believe are undervalued. The portfolio managers partition the Portfolio s selection universe by industry and then identify what they believe to be undervalued securities in each industry to determine potential holdings for the Portfolio representing a broad range of industry groups. The portfolio managers use quantitative factors to screen the Portfolio s selection universe, analyzing factors such as price momentum (i.e., changes in security price relative to changes in overall market prices) and earnings estimate revisions (i.e., changes in analysts earnings-per-share estimates), and also review and consider fundamental changes. In addition, a portion of the securities selected for the Portfolio are identified primarily on the basis of their dividend yields. After further narrowing the universe through a combination of qualitative analysis and fundamental research, the portfolio managers select securities for the Portfolio. In addition to common stocks and other equity securities (such as preferred stocks, convertible securities and warrants), the Portfolio may invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and in non-u.s. securities, including emerging market securities. Prospectus 14 NFJ Dividend Value Portfolio (continued) Principal Risks Performance Information The principal risks of investing in the Portfolio, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return, are (in alphabetical order after the first three risks): Market Risk: The Portfolio will be affected by factors influencing the U.S. or global economies and securities markets or relevant industries or sectors within them. Issuer Risk: The Portfolio will be affected by factors specific to the issuers of securities and other instruments in which the Portfolio invests, including actual or perceived changes in the financial condition or business prospects of such issuers. Equity Securities Risk: Equity securities may react more strongly to changes in an issuer s financial condition or prospects than other securities of the same issuer. Credit and Counterparty Risk: An issuer or counterparty may default on obligations. Currency Risk: The values of non-u.s. securities may fluctuate with currency exchange rates and exposure to non-u.s. currencies may subject the Portfolio to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Emerging Markets Risk: Non-U.S. investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that the Portfolio invests in emerging market securities. These securities may present market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal, political, technical and other risks different from, or greater than, the risks of investing in developed countries. Focused Investment Risk: Focusing on a limited number of issuers, sectors, industries or geographic regions increases risk and volatility. Liquidity Risk: The lack of an active market for investments may cause delay in disposition or force a sale below fair value. Management Risk: The Portfolio will be affected by the allocation determinations, investment decisions and techniques of the Portfolio s management. Non-U.S. Investment Risk: Non-U.S. securities markets and issuers may be more volatile, smaller, less liquid, less transparent and subject to less oversight, particularly in emerging markets. REIT and Real Estate-Related Investment Risk: Adverse changes in the real estate markets may affect the value of REIT investments or real estate-linked derivatives. Smaller Company Risk: Securities issued by smaller companies may be more volatile and present increased liquidity risk relative to securities issued by larger companies. Turnover Risk: High levels of portfolio turnover increase transaction costs and may lower investment performance. Please see Summary of Principal Risks in this Prospectus for a more detailed description of the Portfolio s risks. It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Portfolio. An investment in the Portfolio is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The performance information below provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Portfolio by showing changes in its total return from year to year and by comparing the Portfolio s average annual total returns with those of a broad-based market index and a performance average of similar mutual funds. Performance shown does not reflect any charges or expenses imposed by an insurance company and if it did, performance would be lower. Past performance is not necessarily predictive of future performance.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, shares of the Portfolios also are available to be purchased by insurance dedicated fund-of-funds vehicles ( AllianzIM Funds ) managed by Allianz Investment Management LLC ( AllianzIM ), an affiliate of the Manager (as defined below). The Trust requires no minimum investment for AllianzIM Funds or Separate Accounts, but insurers may require minimum investments from those purchasing Variable Contracts for which the Portfolio is an underlying investment option. Generally, purchase and redemption orders for Portfolio shares are processed at the net asset value (NAV) next calculated after an order is received by the distributor or an authorized intermediary. NAVs are determined only on days when the New York Stock Exchange is open for regular trading. For tax purposes, the shareholders of the Portfolio are the AllianzIM Funds or, in the case of direct investment, insurance companies offering Variable Contracts. If you are investing in the Portfolio through a Variable Contract, please refer to the prospectus for your Separate Account and the Variable Contract for information regarding the federal income tax treatment of distributions to the Separate Account. If you purchase the Portfolio through a broker-dealer, the Portfolio and its related companies may pay the brokerdealer for the sale of Portfolio shares and related services. To the extent that shares of the Portfolio are sold to AllianzIM Funds that in turn are sold to Separate Accounts of insurance companies that fund Variable Contracts, or are sold directly to such Separate Accounts, the Portfolio and/or its related companies may also pay the insurance company and other intermediaries for the (direct or indirect) sale of the Portfolio and/or other services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer, insurance company or intermediary and your salesperson to recommend a Variable Contract and the Portfolio over another investment. Ask your insurance company or salesperson or visit your financial intermediary s Web site for more information. Prospectus 36 RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio Investment Objective Fees and Expenses of the Portfolio The Portfolio seeks long term capital appreciation. The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Portfolio. The table does not reflect the fees and expenses of AllianzIM Funds or Variable Contracts (each as defined below) through which investors may invest indirectly into the Portfolio. If it did, expenses would be higher. Shareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment): None Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment) Portfolio Management Fees Distribution and/or Service (12b-1) Fees Other Expenses Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses (1)(2) Expense Reductions (3) Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses After Expense Reductions (3) RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT 0.70% 0.25% 0.86% 0.05% 1.86% (0.66)% 1.20% (1) Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses do not match the Ratio of Expenses to Average Net Assets of the Fund as set forth in the Financial Highlights table of the Fund s prospectus, in part, because the Ratio of Expenses to Average Net Assets in the prospectus reflects the operating expenses of the Fund and does not include Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. (2) Expenses have been restated to reflect current fees. (3) Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses After Expense Reductions reflect the effect of a contractual agreement by Allianz Global Investors Fund Management LLC ( Allianz Global Fund Management or the Manager ) to irrevocably waive its management fee and/or reimburse the Portfolio through April 30, 2017 to the extent that Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses, excluding interest, tax, and extraordinary expenses, and certain credits and other expenses, plus the Portfolio s Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, exceed 1.20% for Portfolio shares. Under the Expense Limitation Agreement, the Manager may recoup waived or reimbursed amounts for three years, provided total expenses, including such recoupment, do not exceed the annual expense limit in effect at the time of such waiver/reimbursement or recoupment. Examples. The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in shares of the Portfolio with the costs of investing in other mutual funds.

If they did, expenses would be higher. Portfolio 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 10 Years RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio $122 $521 $944 $2,126 Portfolio Turnover. The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). The Portfolio s portfolio turnover rate from its inception on April 27, 2015 through the end of its fiscal year on December 31, 2015 was 58% of the average value of its Portfolio. High levels of portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses or in the Examples above, can adversely affect the Portfolio s investment performance. Principal Investment Strategies The Portfolio seeks to achieve its investment objective through a combination of active allocation between asset classes and actively managed strategies within those asset classes. The Portfolio invests directly and indirectly in a globally diverse combination of equity securities, and U.S. dollar denominated fixed income securities, in each case including emerging market securities. The Portfolio s baseline long-term asset allocation consists of 60% to equity exposure (the Equity Component ) and 40% to fixed income exposure (the Fixed Income Component ), which is also the allocation of the blended benchmark index against which the Portfolio is managed. The portfolio managers will typically over- or under-weight the Portfolio against this baseline long-term allocation, depending upon the portfolio managers view of the relative attractiveness of the investment opportunities available, which will change over time. The Portfolio may invest significantly below its target with respect to the Equity Component and significantly above its target with respect to the Fixed Income Component. Under normal circumstances, the Portfolio will not invest more than 20% of its assets in any combination of the following asset classes: high yield debt (commonly known as junk bonds ), bank loans, global bonds, emerging markets equities, emerging markets debt, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities ( TIPS ) and real estate securities, including U.S. and non-u.s. real estate investment trusts ( REITs ). The Portfolio may either invest directly in these different asset classes or indirectly through derivatives and other instruments, such as through investments in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). 4 Premier Multi-Series VIT7 RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio (continued) The portfolio managers currently expect that the Portfolio s average duration with respect to any fixed-income asset class in which the Portfolio invests directly will typically resemble that of a related broad-based index. The portfolio managers allocate the Portfolio s investments among asset classes in response to changing market, economic, and political factors and events that the portfolio managers believe may affect the value of the Portfolio s investments. The Portfolio seeks to limit downside risk by moving toward less volatile asset classes during periods of high market volatility. Volatility is a statistical measure of risk relating to the magnitude of up and down fluctuations in the value of a financial instrument or index over time and typically results from rapid price swings. Under normal circumstances, the Portfolio will seek to maintain a one year annualized volatility level at or below 12% over a market cycle. A higher volatility level indicates more frequent or rapid up and down fluctuations in the values of the Portfolio s investments relative to a lower volatility level. There can be no assurance that investment decisions made in seeking to manage Portfolio volatility will achieve the desired results. The Portfolio s actual or realized volatility will be dependent on the market environment. The portfolio managers may adjust the Portfolio s exposure to the Equity Component and the Fixed Income Component in response to momentum and momentum reversion signals in an effort to mitigate downside risk in times of severe market stress and to increase the return potential in favorable markets. Momentum is the tendency of a performance trend to continue to move in the same direction. Momentum reversion is the tendency that a performance trend will ultimately change and move in an opposite direction. While the portfolio managers attempt to mitigate the downside risk to stabilize performance, there can be no assurance that the Portfolio will be successful in doing so. The portfolio managers also apply fundamental analysis to adjust the Portfolio s exposure to the asset classes that exhibit the strongest return prospects. The Portfolio may invest in securities of companies of any capitalization, including smaller capitalization companies. The Portfolio also may make investments intended to provide exposure to one or more securities indices, currencies, and real estate-related securities. The Portfolio is expected to be highly diversified across industries, sectors, and countries. In implementing these investment strategies, the Portfolio may make substantial use of over-the-counter (OTC) or exchange-traded derivatives, including futures contracts, interest rate swaps, total return swaps, credit default swaps, currency forwards, and structured notes. The Portfolio may use derivatives for a variety of purposes, including: as a hedge against adverse changes in the market price of securities, interest rates, or currency exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to increase the Portfolio s return as a non-hedging strategy that may be considered speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. The Portfolio may maintain a significant percentage of its assets in cash and cash equivalents which will serve as margin or collateral for the Portfolio s obligations under derivative transactions. The Portfolio may, at any time, invest in affiliated and unaffiliated funds, ETFs and pooled investment vehicles. The Portfolio may participate in initial public offerings (IPOs). Principal Risks The principal risks of investing in the Portfolio, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return, are (in alphabetical order after the first five risks): Credit and Counterparty Risk: An issuer or counterparty may default on obligations. Currency Risk: The values of non-u.s. securities may fluctuate with currency exchange rates and exposure to non-u.s. currencies may subject the Portfolio to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Derivatives Risk: Derivative instruments are complex, have different characteristics than their underlying assets and are subject to additional risks, including leverage, liquidity and valuation. Equity Securities Risk: Equity securities may react more strongly to changes in an issuer s financial condition or prospects than other securities of the same issuer. Fixed Income Risk: Fixed income (debt) securities are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, may be speculative and may decline in value due to changes in interest rates or an issuer s or counterparty s deterioration or default. Prospectus 58 RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio (continued) Emerging Markets Risk: Non-U.S. investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that the Portfolio invests in emerging market securities. These securities may present market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal, political, technical and other risks different from, or greater than, the risks of investing in developed countries. High Yield Risk: High-yield or junk bonds are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, may be speculative and may decline in value due to increases in interest rates or an issuer s deterioration or default. Index Risk: Investments in index-linked derivatives are subject to the risks associated with the applicable index. Interest Rate Risk: Fixed income securities may decline in value because of increases in interest rates. IPO Risk: Securities purchased in initial public offerings have no trading history, limited issuer information and increased volatility. Issuer Risk: The Portfolio will be affected by factors specific to the issuers of securities and other instruments in which the Portfolio invests, including actual or perceived changes in the financial condition or business prospects of such issuers. Leveraging Risk: Instruments and transactions that constitute leverage magnify gains or losses and increase volatility. Liquidity Risk: The lack of an active market for investments may cause delay in disposition or force a sale below fair value. Management Risk: The Portfolio will be affected by the allocation determinations, investment decisions and techniques of the Portfolio s management. Market Risk: The Portfolio will be affected by factors influencing the U.S. or global economies and securities markets or relevant industries or sectors within them. Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed Risk: Investing in mortgage- and asset-backed securities involves interest rate, credit, valuation, extension and liquidity risks and the risk that payments on the underlying assets are delayed, prepaid, subordinated or defaulted on. Non-U.S. Investment Risk: Non-U.S. securities markets and issuers may be more volatile, smaller, less liquid, less transparent and subject to less oversight, particularly in emerging markets. REIT and Real Estate-Related Investment Risk: Adverse changes in the real estate markets may affect the value of REIT investments or real estate-linked derivatives. Smaller Company Risk: Securities issued by smaller companies may be more volatile and present increased liquidity risk relative to securities issued by larger companies. Turnover Risk: High levels of portfolio turnover increase transaction costs and may lower investment performance. Variable Distribution Risk: Periodic distributions by investments of variable or floating interest rates vary with fluctuations in market interest rates. Please see Summary of Principal Risks in this Prospectus for a more detailed description of the Portfolio s risks. It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Portfolio. An investment in the Portfolio is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.

Prospectus 710 Principal Investments and Strategies of Each Portfolio This section, together with the next section entitled Summary of Principal Risks, provides more detailed information regarding each Portfolio s investment objective, principal investments and strategies and principal risks. It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Portfolios. The fact that a Portfolio may have had good performance in the past is no assurance that the value of the Portfolio s investments will not decline in the future or appreciate at a slower rate. 8 Premier Multi-Series VIT11 Principal Investments and Strategies Principal Risks NFJ Dividend Value Portfolio Investment Objective Seeks long-term growth of capital and income Portfolio Category Value stocks Portfolio Focus Income producing common stocks with potential for capital appreciation Approximate Primary Capitalization Range Greater than $3.5 billion Dividend Frequency Annually The Portfolio seeks to achieve its investment objective by normally investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings made for investment purposes) in common stocks and other equity securities of companies that pay or are expected to pay dividends. Under normal market and other conditions, the Portfolio will invest primarily in common stocks of companies with market capitalizations greater than $3.5 billion.

In addition, a portion of the securities selected for the Portfolio are identified primarily on the basis of their dividend yields. After still further narrowing the universe through a combination of qualitative analysis and fundamental research, the portfolio managers select approximately 40 to 60 securities for the Portfolio. The portfolio managers consider selling a security when any of the factors leading to its purchase materially changes or when a more attractive candidate is identified, including when an alternative security with strong fundamentals demonstrates a lower valuation ratio, a higher dividend yield or favorable qualitative metrics. In response to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the Portfolio may deviate from its principal strategies by making temporary investments of some or all of its assets in high-quality fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents. The Portfolio may be less likely to achieve its investment objective when it does so. Among the principal risks of investing in the Portfolio, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return, are (in alphabetical order after the first three risks): Market Risk Issuer Risk Equity Securities Risk Credit and Counterparty Risk Currency Risk Emerging Markets Risk Focused Investment Risk Liquidity Risk Management Risk Non-U.S. Investment Risk REIT and Real Estate- Related Investment Risk Smaller Company Risk Turnover Risk Please see Summary of Principal Risks following this section for a description of these and other risks of investing in the Portfolio.

To gain exposure to the various asset classes, the Portfolio incorporates actively managed strategies and/or passive instruments, including affiliated and unaffiliated funds, pooled investment vehicles, exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) and exchange-traded notes, and derivative instruments such as futures. The Portfolio invests directly and indirectly in a globally diverse combination of equity securities, and U.S. dollar denominated fixed income securities, in each case including emerging market securities. The Portfolio s baseline long-term asset allocation consists of 60% to equity exposure (the Equity Component ) and 40% to fixed income exposure (the Fixed Income Component ), which is also the allocation of the blended benchmark index against which the Portfolio is managed.

The Portfolio may either invest directly in these different asset classes or indirectly through derivatives and other instruments, such as through investments in mutual funds or ETFs. The portfolio managers currently expect that the Portfolio s average duration with respect to any fixed-income asset class (e.g. governments) in which the Portfolio invests directly (i.e., not through derivatives or ETFs) will typically resemble that of a related broad-based index. For example, with respect to government securities, the portfolio managers target a maximum duration of one year above the duration of the Barclays Aggregate Government Bond Index. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security s price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security s duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates. The portfolio managers allocate the Portfolio s investments among asset classes in response to changing market, economic, and political factors and events that the portfolio managers believe may affect the value of the Portfolio s investments. In making investment decisions for the Portfolio, the portfolio managers seek to identify trends and turning points in the global markets. The portfolio managers analyze market cycles, economic cycles and valuations of each asset class and their components and may adjust the Portfolio s exposures to individual holdings and asset classes. The portfolio managers also employ a risk management strategy, which may cause an adjustment to the Portfolio s asset allocation in an effort to mitigate certain downside risks. Depending on market conditions, the Equity Component may range between approximately 10% and 65% of the Portfolio s assets and the Fixed Income Component may account for up to 90% of the Portfolio s assets at the time of investment. The Portfolio seeks to limit downside risk by moving toward less volatile asset classes during periods of high market volatility. Volatility is a statistical measure of risk relating to the magnitude of up and down fluctuations in the value of a financial instrument or index over time and typically results from rapid price swings. Under normal circumstances, the Portfolio will seek to maintain a one year annualized volatility level at or below 12% over a market cycle. A higher volatility level indicates more frequent or rapid up and down fluctuations in the values of the Portfolio s investments relative to a lower volatility level. There can be no assurance that investment decisions made in seeking to manage Portfolio volatility will achieve the desired results. The Portfolio s actual or realized volatility will be dependent on the market environment. The portfolio managers may adjust the Portfolio s exposure to the Equity Component and the Fixed Income Component in response to momentum and momentum reversion signals in an effort to mitigate downside risk in times of severe market stress and to increase the return potential in favorable markets. Momentum is the tendency of a performance trend to continue to move in the same direction. Momentum reversion is the tendency that a performance trend will ultimately change and move in an opposite direction. The portfolio 10 Premier Multi-Series VIT13 RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio (continued) Principal Risks managers look for signals through use of quantitative metrics which may signal momentum or momentum reversion. The portfolio managers believe positive momentum suggests future periods of positive investment returns and typical levels of market volatility. When the momentum signals for an asset class indicate positive momentum, the portfolio managers may increase the Portfolio s exposure to that asset class. The portfolio managers believe negative momentum suggests future periods of negative investment returns and increased volatility. When the portfolio managers recognize negative momentum for an asset class, the Portfolio may reduce its exposure to that asset class. Momentum reversion signals indicate when momentum appears excessive. In such circumstances the portfolio managers may act counter to the momentum. In evaluating momentum and momentum reversion signals, the portfolio managers will designate sub-categories of asset classes within the Equity Component and the Fixed Income Component, which may change over time. While the portfolio managers attempt to mitigate the downside risk to stabilize performance, there can be no assurance that the Portfolio will be successful in doing so. In addition to the momentum and momentum reversion signals, the portfolio managers also apply fundamental analysis to adjust the Portfolio s exposure to the asset classes that exhibit the strongest return prospects. The fundamental analysis attempts to locate opportunities not identified from momentum-related signals. After determining the asset allocation among the Components, the portfolio managers select particular investments in an effort to obtain exposure to the relevant mix of asset classes. The Portfolio may invest in any type of equity or fixed income security, including common and preferred stocks, ETFs, warrants, mortgagebacked securities, asset-backed securities and government and corporate bonds. The Portfolio may invest in securities of companies of any capitalization, including smaller capitalization companies. The Portfolio also may make investments intended to provide exposure to one or more securities indices, currencies, and real estaterelated securities. The Portfolio is expected to be highly diversified across industries, sectors, and countries. The Portfolio may liquidate a holding if it locates another instrument that offers a more attractive exposure to an asset class or when there is a change in the Portfolio s target asset allocation, or if the instrument is otherwise deemed inappropriate. In implementing these investment strategies, the Portfolio may make substantial use of over-the-counter (OTC) or exchange-traded derivatives, including futures contracts, interest rate swaps, total return swaps, credit default swaps, currency forwards, and structured notes. The Portfolio may use derivatives for a variety of purposes, including: as a hedge against adverse changes in the market price of securities, interest rates, or currency exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to increase the Portfolio s return as a non-hedging strategy that may be considered speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. The Portfolio may maintain a significant percentage of its assets in cash and cash equivalents which will serve as margin or collateral for the Portfolio s obligations under derivative transactions. The Portfolio may, at any time, invest in affiliated and unaffiliated funds (which may include certain affiliated mutual funds and ETFs sponsored by Allianz Asset Management of America L.P. or its subsidiaries (the Underlying Funds ) and ETFs, mutual funds and pooled investment vehicles other than the Underlying Funds ( Other Acquired Funds )). The Portfolio may participate in initial public offerings (IPOs). Among the principal risks of investing in the Portfolio, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return, are (in alphabetical order after the first five risks): Credit and Counterparty Risk Currency Risk Derivatives Risk Equity Securities Risk Fixed Income Risk Emerging Markets Risk High Yield Risk Index Risk Interest Rate Risk IPO Risk Issuer Risk Leveraging Risk Liquidity Risk Management Risk Market Risk Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed Risk Non-U.S. Investment Risk REIT and Real Estate- Related Investment Risk Smaller Company Risk Turnover Risk Variable Distribution Risk Please see Summary of Principal Risks following this section for a description of these and other risks of investing in the Portfolio. Prospectus 1114 Credit and Counterparty Risk Currency Risk Derivatives Risk Summary of Principal Risks The value of your investment in a Portfolio changes with the values of that Portfolio s investments. Many factors can affect those values. The factors that are most likely to have a material effect on a particular Portfolio s portfolio as a whole are called principal risks. The principal risks of each Portfolio are summarized in the Portfolio Summaries and are described in more detail in this section. Each Portfolio may be subject to additional risks other than those described below because the types of investments made by a Portfolio can change over time. Securities and investment techniques appearing in bold type below are described in greater detail under Characteristics and Risks of Securities and Investment Techniques. That section and Investment Objectives and Policies in the Statement of Additional Information also include more information about the Portfolios, their investments and the related risks. There is no guarantee that a Portfolio will be able to achieve its investment objective. It is possible to lose money by investing in a Portfolio. A Portfolio could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security (including a security purchased with securities lending cash collateral) is unable or unwilling, or is perceived (whether by market participants, ratings agencies, pricing services or otherwise) as unable or unwilling, to make timely principal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Securities are subject to varying degrees of credit risk, which are often reflected in their credit ratings and a fund holding a fixed income security is subject to the risk that the security s credit rating will be downgraded. Securities issued by the U.S. Treasury historically have presented minimal credit risk. However, at least one major rating agency downgraded the long-term U.S. credit rating in 2011 due to the rising public debt burden and perception of greater policymaking uncertainty in the U.S. and introduced greater uncertainty about the ability of the U.S. to repay its obligations. A further credit rating downgrade or a U.S. credit default could decrease the value and increase the volatility of a Portfolio s investments, to the extent that a Portfolio has exposure to securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. Counterparty Risk. A Portfolio is also subject to the risk that a counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement, aloan of portfolio securities or an unsettled transaction may be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments or otherwise honor its obligations to the Portfolio. If a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, goes bankrupt, or otherwise experiences a business interruption, a Portfolio could miss investment opportunities or otherwise hold investments it would prefer to sell, resulting in losses for the Portfolio. Counterparty risk may be pronounced during unusually adverse market conditions and may be particularly acute in environments in which financial services firms are exposed to systemic risks of the type evidenced by the 2008 insolvency of Lehman Brothers and subsequent market disruptions. Portfolios that invest directly in foreign (non-u.s.) currencies, or in securities that trade in, or receive revenues in, foreign currencies, or in derivatives that provide exposure to foreign currencies are subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar, or, in the case of hedging positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline in value relative to the currency being hedged. Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates, intervention (or the failure to intervene) by U.S. or non-u.s. governments, central banks or supranational entities such as the International Monetary Fund, or by the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the United States or abroad. As a result, a Portfolio s exposure to foreign currencies, including investments in foreign currencydenominated securities, may reduce the returns of that Portfolio. The local emerging market currencies in which a Portfolio may be invested from time to time may experience substantially greater volatility against the U.S. dollar than the major convertible currencies of developed countries. Derivatives are financial contracts whose value depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, reference rate or index. The derivatives that may be used by a Portfolio are discussed in more detail under Characteristics and Risks of Securities and Investment Techniques Derivatives in this Prospectus and described in more detail under Investment Objectives and Policies in the Statement of Additional Information. A Portfolio may (but is not required to) use derivatives as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks, such as risks associated with changes in interest rates or currency risk. A Portfolio may also use derivatives for leverage, which increases opportunities for gain but also involves greater risk of loss due to leveraging risk, and to gain exposure to issuers, indices, sectors, currencies and/or geographic regions. A Portfolio s use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. A Portfolio s investment in a derivative instrument could lose more than the principal amount invested, and the use of certain derivatives may subject a Portfolio to the potential for unlimited loss. Derivatives are subject to a number of risks described elsewhere in this section, such as liquidity risk, market risk, credit and counterparty risk and management risk. As a seller of a credit default swap, a Portfolio effectively adds economic leverage because, in addition to its total net assets, the Portfolio is 12 Premier Multi-Series VIT15 Emerging Markets Risk subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap. See Leveraging Risk. Additionally, holding a position in a credit default swap could result in losses if a Portfolio does not correctly evaluate the creditworthiness of the company on which the credit default swap is based. To the extent a Portfolio writes call options on individual securities that it does not hold in its portfolio (i.e., naked call options), it is subject to the risk that a liquid market for the underlying security may not exist at the time an option is exercised or when a Portfolio otherwise seeks to close out an option position. Naked call options have speculative characteristics and the potential for unlimited loss. Derivatives also involve the risk of mispricing or improper valuation, the risk of ambiguous documentation, and the risk that changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Also, suitable derivative transactions may not be available in all circumstances and there can be no assurance that a Portfolio will engage in these transactions to reduce exposure to other risks when that would be beneficial or that, if used, such strategies will be successful. Under recently adopted rules and regulations, transactions in some types of swaps (including interest rate swaps and credit default swaps on North American and European indices) are required to be centrally cleared. In a cleared derivatives transaction, a Portfolio s counterparty is a clearing house, rather than a bank or broker. Since a Portfolio is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house can participate directly in the clearing house, a Portfolio will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. In cleared derivatives transactions, a Portfolio will make payments (including margin payments) to and receive payments from a clearing house through their accounts at clearing members. Clearing members guarantee performance of their clients obligations to the clearing house. Centrally cleared derivative arrangements may be less favorable to mutual funds than bilateral arrangements. For example, a Portfolio may be required to provide greater amounts of margin for cleared derivatives transactions than for bilateral derivatives transactions. Also, in contrast to bilateral derivatives transactions, following a period of notice to a Portfolio, a clearing member generally can require termination of existing cleared derivatives transactions at any time or increases in margin requirements above the margin that the clearing member required at the beginning of a transaction. Clearing houses also have broad rights to increase margin requirements for existing transactions or to terminate transactions at any time. Other recent U.S. and non-u.s. legislative and regulatory reforms, including those related to the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the 1940 Act restrictions with respect to senior securities, have resulted in, and may in the future result in, new regulation of derivative instruments and the Portfolios use of such instruments. New regulations could, among other things, restrict a Portfolio s ability to engage in derivative transactions (for example, by making certain types of derivative instruments or transactions no longer available to a Portfolio), establish new margin requirements and/or increase the costs of derivatives transactions, and the Portfolio may as a result be unable to execute its investment strategies in a manner its Sub- Adviser might otherwise choose. A Portfolio that invests in non-u.s. securities and/or currencies may experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than a portfolio that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. issuers or securities that trade exclusively in U.S. markets. See Non-U.S. Investment Risk below. Non-U.S. investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that a Portfolio invests in emerging market securities, that is, securities of issuers tied economically to countries with developing economies. These securities may present market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal, political, technical and other risks different from, or greater than, the risks of investing in developed countries. Certain emerging market countries may impose restrictions on foreign investment and repatriation of investment income and capital. In addition, foreign investors, including a Portfolio, may be required to register the proceeds of sales, and future economic or political crises could lead to price controls, forced mergers, nationalization or the creation of government monopolies. The currencies of emerging market countries may experience significant declines against the U.S. dollar, and devaluation may occur subsequent to investments in these currencies by a Portfolio. See Currency Risk. Inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had, and may continue to have, negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market countries. Emerging market securities may trade in more limited volume than comparable securities in developed foreign markets. Emerging market securities may have different clearance and settlement procedures, which may be unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions or otherwise make it difficult to engage in such transactions. Settlement problems may cause a Portfolio to miss attractive investment opportunities, hold a portion of its assets in cash pending investment, or be delayed in disposing of a portfolio security, all of which would negatively affect the Portfolio s performance. Prospectus 1316 Equity Securities Risk Fixed Income Risk In addition, the risks associated with investing in a narrowly-defined geographic area (discussed below under Non-U.S. Investment Risk and Focused Investment Risk ) are generally more pronounced with respect to investments in emerging market countries. A Portfolio may also be subject to Emerging Markets Risk if it invests in derivatives or other securities or instruments whose value or returns are related to the value or returns of emerging market securities. Equity securities represent an ownership interest, or the right to acquire an ownership interest, in an issuer. Equity securities may take the form of shares of common stock of a corporation, membership interests in a limited liability company, limited partnership interests, or other forms of ownership interests. Equity securities also include, among other things, preferred stocks, convertible securities and warrants. The value of a company s equity securities may fall as a result of factors directly relating to that company, such as decisions made by its management or lower demand for the company s products or services. The value of an equity security may also fall because of factors affecting not just the company, but also companies in the same industry or in a number of different industries, such as increases in production costs. The value of a company s equity securities may also be affected by changes in financial markets that are relatively unrelated to the company or its industry, such as changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates or adverse circumstances involving the credit markets. In addition, because a company s equity securities rank junior in priority to the interests of bond holders and other creditors, a company s equity securities will usually react more strongly than its bonds and other debt to actual or perceived changes in the company s financial condition or prospects. To the extent a Portfolio invests in equity-related instruments it will also be subject to these risks. A Portfolio s investments may focus on equity securities of companies that its portfolio managers believe will experience relatively rapid earnings growth (growth securities) or that its portfolio managers believe are selling at a price lower than their true value (value securities). Growth securities typically trade at higher multiples of current earnings than other securities. Therefore, the value of growth securities may be more sensitive to changes in current or expected earnings than the value of other securities. Companies that issue value securities may have experienced adverse business developments or may be subject to special risks that have caused their securities to be out of favor. If a portfolio manager s assessment of a company s prospects is wrong, or if the market does not recognize the value of the company, the price of its securities may decline or may not approach the value that the portfolio manager anticipates. A Portfolio that invests in fixed income instruments is subject to interest rate risk. Changes in the market values of fixed income instruments are largely a function of changes in the current level of interest rates. The value of a Portfolio s investments in fixed income instruments will typically change as the level of interest rates fluctuate. During periods of declining interest rates, the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to rise. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to decline. Duration is one measure of the expected life of a fixed income instrument that is used to determine the sensitivity of a security s price to changes in interest rates. Securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates, usually making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations. As a general rule, a 1% rise in interest rates means a 1% fall in value for every year of positive duration. Similarly, as a general rule, if a Portfolio exhibited a negative duration profile and interest rates declined by 1%, there would be a 1% fall in value for every year of negative duration. Inflation-indexed securities, including Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPs), decline in value when interest rates rise. In certain interest rate environments, such as when real interest rates are rising faster than nominal interest rates, inflation-indexed securities may experience greater losses than other fixed income instruments with similar durations. A nominal interest rate can be described as the sum of a real interest rate and an expected inflation rate. Also, some portfolios (e.g., portfolios with mortgage-backed and other prepayable securities) have changing durations and may have increasing durations precisely when that is least advantageous (i.e., when interest rates are rising). A Portfolio that invests in securities that are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in prevailing interest rates is subject to relatively high levels of interest rate risk. Such securities include various mortgage-related securities (e.g., the interest-only or IO class of a stripped mortgage-backed security) and zero coupon securities (fixed income instruments, including certain U.S. Government securities, that do not make periodic interest payments and are purchased at a discount from their value at maturity). The Portfolios may invest in securities issued by U.S. Government agencies or government enterprises. Although some of these securities may be guaranteed as to the payment of principal or interest by the relevant enterprise or agency, others may not be guaranteed, and therefore may be riskier than securities guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. 14 Premier Multi-Series VIT17 High Yield Risk Index Risk Interest Rate Risk IPO Risk Focused Investment Risk A Portfolio that invests in high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (sometimes referred to as high yield securities or junk bonds ) may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than a Portfolio that does not invest in such securities. These securities are considered predominately speculative with respect to the issuer s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments. An economic downturn or period of rising interest rates could adversely affect the market for these securities and reduce a Portfolio s ability to sell these securities (liquidity risk). If the issuer of a security is in default with respect to interest or principal payments, a Portfolio may lose its entire investment. Because of the risks involved in investing in high yield securities, an investment in a Portfolio that invests in such securities should be considered speculative. The debt instruments of many non-u.s. governments, including their agencies, sub-divisions and instrumentalities, are below investment grade, and are therefore considered high yield instruments. Because certain Underlying Funds and Other Acquired Funds invest in derivatives that are linked to the performance of an index, they will be subject to the risks associated with changes in the applicable index. If the applicable index changes, such a fund could receive lower interest payments (in the case of a debt-related derivative) or experience a reduction in the value of the derivative to below what the fund paid. Certain indexed securities may create leverage to the extent that they increase or decrease in value at a rate that is a multiple of the changes in the applicable index. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed income securities valuations will change because of changes in interest rates. During periods of rising nominal interest rates, the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to decline. Conversely, during periods of declining nominal interest rates, the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to rise. To the extent that a Portfolio effectively has short positions with respect to fixed income instruments, the values of such short positions would generally be expected to rise when nominal interest rates rise and to decline when nominal interest rates decline. A nominal interest rate can be described as the sum of a real interest rate and an expected inflation rate. Fixed income securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates, usually making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations. The values of equity and other non-fixed income securities may also decline due to fluctuations in interest rates. Variable and floating rate securities generally are less sensitive to interest rate changes but may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Conversely, floating rate securities will not generally increase in value if interest rates decline. Inverse floating rate securities may decrease in value if interest rates increase. Inverse floating rate securities may also exhibit greater price volatility than a fixed rate obligation with similar credit quality. When a Portfolio holds variable or floating rate securities, a decrease (or, in the case of inverse floating rate securities, an increase) in market interest rates will adversely affect the income received from such securities and the net asset value of the Portfolio s shares. Securities offered in initial public offerings (IPOs) are subject to many of the same risks of investing in companies with smaller market capitalizations and often to a heightened degree. Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history, and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods. In addition, the prices of securities sold in IPOs may be highly volatile. At any particular time or from time to time, a Portfolio may not be able to invest in securities issued in IPOs, or invest to the extent desired, because, for example, only a small portion (if any) of the securities being offered in an IPO may be made available to that Portfolio. In addition, under certain market conditions, a relatively small number of companies may issue securities in IPOs. Similarly, as the number of funds to which IPO securities are allocated increases, the number of securities issued to any one fund may decrease. The investment performance of a Portfolio during periods when it is unable to invest significantly or at all in IPOs may be lower than during periods when that Portfolio is able to do so. In addition, as a Portfolio increases in size, the impact of IPOs on that Portfolio s performance will generally decrease. Focusing Portfolio investments in a small number of issuers, industries, foreign currencies or regions increases risk. Portfolios that are non-diversified because they may invest a significant portion of their assets in a relatively small number of issuers may have more risk because changes in the value of a single security or the impact of a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence may have a greater adverse impact on a Portfolio s net asset value. Similarly, certain underlying bond funds may have more risk because they may invest a substantial portion of their assets in bonds of similar projects or from issuers of the same status. Some of those issuers also may present substantial credit or other risks. Diversified Portfolios that invest in a relatively small number of issuers are subject to similar risks. In addition, a Portfolio may be subject to increased risk to the extent it focuses its investments in securities denominated in a particular foreign currency or in a narrowly defined geographic area, for example, regional economic risks relating to weather emergencies and natural disasters. Similarly, a Portfolio that focuses its investments in a certain type of issuer is particularly vulnerable to Prospectus 1518 Issuer Risk Leveraging Risk Liquidity Risk Management Risk events affecting such type of issuer. Also, a Portfolio may have greater risk to the extent it invests a substantial portion of its assets in a group of related industries (or sectors ). The industries comprising any particular sector and investments in a particular foreign currency or in a narrowly defined geographic area outside the United States may share common characteristics, are often subject to similar business risks and regulatory burdens, and react similarly to economic, market, political or other developments. Furthermore, certain issuers, industries and regions may be adversely affected by the impacts of climate change on the demand for and the development of goods and services and related production costs, and the impacts of legislation, regulation and international accords related to climate change, as well as any indirect consequences of regulation or business trends driven by climate change. The value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that directly relate to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer s goods or services as well as the historical and prospective earnings of the issuer and the value of its assets. Leverage, including borrowing, will cause the value of a Portfolio s shares to be more volatile than if the Portfolio did not use leverage. This is because leverage tends to exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Portfolio s portfolio securities. A Portfolio may engage in transactions or purchase instruments that give rise to forms of leverage. Such transactions and instruments may include, among others, the use of reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowings, the investment of collateral from loans of portfolio securities, or the use of when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward commitment transactions. The use of derivatives and short sales may also involve leverage. The use of leverage may cause a Portfolio to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements. Certain types of leveraging transactions, such as short sales that are not against the box, could theoretically be subject to unlimited losses in cases where a Portfolio, for any reason, is unable to close out the transaction. In addition, to the extent a Portfolio borrows money, interest costs on such borrowings may not be recovered by any appreciation of the securities purchased with the borrowed amounts and could exceed the Portfolio s investment returns, resulting in greater losses. Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell, possibly preventing a Portfolio from purchasing or selling such illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price, or possibly requiring a Portfolio to dispose of other investments at unfavorable times or prices in order to satisfy its obligations. Portfolios with principal investment strategies that involve securities of companies with smaller market capitalizations, non-u.s. securities, Rule 144A securities, derivatives or securities with substantial market and/or credit risk tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity risk. Additionally, the market for certain investments may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions independent of any specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer. In such cases, a Portfolio, due to limitations on investments in illiquid securities and the difficulty in purchasing and selling such securities or instruments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain issuer or sector. Each Portfolio is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed investment portfolio. The Manager, the respective Sub-Adviser and the individual portfolio managers will apply investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Portfolios, but there can be no guarantee that these will produce the desired results. To the extent the portfolio managers employ quantitative models, whether proprietary or maintained by third parties, there can be no assurance that such models will behave as expected in all market conditions, including due to deviations between expected and actual relationships among variables. Any imperfections, errors, or limitations in such models could affect a Portfolio s performance. By necessity, such models make simplifying assumptions that limit their effectiveness. In addition, the computer programming used to construct, or the data employed by, quantitative models may contain errors, which may cause losses for a Portfolio or reduce performance. In the event third-party models become increasingly costly or unavailable, the portfolio managers may be forced to rely on proprietary models or to reduce or discontinue their use of quantitative models. The Portfolios are also subject to the risk that deficiencies in the operational systems or controls of the Manager or another service provider will cause losses for the Portfolios or hinder Portfolio operations. For example, trading delays or errors (both human and systemic) could prevent a Portfolio from purchasing a security expected to appreciate in value. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may affect the investment techniques available to the Manager, each Sub-Adviser and each individual portfolio manager in connection with managing the Portfolios and may also adversely affect the ability of the Portfolios to achieve their respective investment objectives. 16 Premier Multi-Series VIT19 Market Risk Mortgage-Related and Other Asset- Backed Risk To the extent portfolio managers employ strategies that are not correlated to broader markets, or that are intended to seek returns under a variety of market conditions, certain Portfolios may outperform the general securities market during periods of flat or negative market performance, and underperform the securities market during periods of strong market performance. The market price of securities owned by a Portfolio may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. To the extent a Portfolio invests substantially in common stocks and/or other equity securities, a principal risk of investing in the Portfolio is that the investments in its portfolio will decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries or sectors represented in those markets. The values of securities may decline due to general market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency rates, adverse changes to credit markets or adverse investor sentiment generally. They may also decline due to factors that disproportionately affect a particular industry, group of related industries or sector, such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry or sector. The market price of fixed income securities, as well as equity securities and other types of investments, may decline due to changes in interest rates or other factors affecting the applicable markets generally. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities, although under certain market conditions fixed income securities may have comparable or greater price volatility. During a general downturn in securities markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value simultaneously. The Portfolios are subject to the risk that geopolitical and other events will disrupt securities markets, adversely affect global economies and markets and thereby decrease the value of the Portfolios investments. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have had a substantial effect on the economies and securities markets of the U.S. and other countries. Terrorism in the U.S. and around the world has had a similar global impact and has increased geopolitical risk. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 resulted in the closure of some U.S. securities markets for four days, and similar attacks are possible in the future. Securities markets may be susceptible to market manipulation (e.g., the potential manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)) or other fraudulent trade practices, which could disrupt the orderly functioning of these markets or adversely affect the value of investments traded in these markets, including investments of the Portfolios. While the U.S. government has honored its credit obligations continuously for the last 200 years, it remains possible that the U.S. could default on its obligations. While it is impossible to predict the consequences of such an unprecedented event, it is likely that a default by the U.S. would be highly disruptive to the U.S. and global securities markets and could significantly impair the value of the Portfolios investments. Similarly, political events within the U.S. at times have resulted, and may in the future result, in a shutdown of government services, which could negatively affect the U.S. economy, decrease the value of many Portfolio investments, and increase uncertainty in or impair the operation of the U.S. or other securities markets. The uncertainty surrounding the sovereign debt of a significant number of European Union countries, as well as the continued existence of the European Union itself, have disrupted and may continue to disrupt markets in the U.S. and around the world. If one or more countries leave the European Union or the European Union dissolves, the world s securities markets likely will be significantly disrupted. Substantial government interventions (e.g., currency controls) also could negatively impact the Portfolios. War, terrorism, economic uncertainty, and related geopolitical events have led, and in the future may lead, to increased short-term market volatility and may have adverse long-term effects on U.S. and world economies and markets generally. Likewise, natural and environmental disasters, such as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in early 2011, and systemic market dislocations of the kind surrounding the insolvency of Lehman Brothers in 2008, if repeated, would be highly disruptive to economies and markets, adversely affecting individual companies and industries, securities markets, interest rates, credit ratings, inflation, investor sentiment, and other factors affecting the value of the Portfolios investments. During such market disruptions, the Portfolios exposure to the risks described elsewhere in this Summary of Principal Risks section will likely increase. Market disruptions, including sudden government interventions, can also prevent a Portfolio from implementing its investment program for a period of time and achieving its investment objective. For example, a market disruption may adversely affect the orderly functioning of the securities markets and may cause the Portfolios derivatives counterparties to discontinue offering derivatives on some underlying commodities, securities, reference rates, or indices, or to offer them on a more limited basis. To the extent a Portfolio has focused its investments in the stock index of a particular region, adverse geopolitical and other events could have a disproportionate impact on the Portfolio. A Portfolio that invests in a variety of mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities is subject to certain additional risks. Generally, rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of fixed-rate mortgage-related securities, making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates. As a result, in a period of rising interest rates, Prospectus 1720 Non-U.S. Investment Risk REIT and Real Estate-Related Investment Risk Smaller Company Risk Turnover Risk to the extent a Portfolio holds mortgage-related securities, it may exhibit additional volatility. This is known as extension risk. In addition, adjustable and fixed-rate mortgage-related securities may involve special risks relating to unanticipated rates of prepayment on the mortgages underlying the securities. This is known as prepayment risk. When interest rates decline, borrowers may pay off their mortgages sooner than expected. This can reduce the returns of a Portfolio because the Portfolio may have to reinvest that money at the lower prevailing interest rates. A Portfolio s investments in other asset-backed securities are subject to risks similar to those associated with mortgage-related securities, as well as additional risks associated with the nature of the assets and the servicing of those assets. The market for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities has recently experienced high volatility and a lack of liquidity. As a result, the value of many of these securities has significantly declined. There can be no assurance that these markets will become more liquid or less volatile, and it is possible that the value of these securities could decline further. A Portfolio that invests in non-u.s. securities may cause it to experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than portfolios that invest exclusively in securities of U.S. issuers or securities that trade exclusively in U.S. markets. The securities markets of many non-u.s. countries are relatively small, with a limited number of companies representing a small number of industries. Additionally, issuers of non-u.s. securities are often not subject to the same degree of regulation as U.S. issuers. Reporting, accounting and auditing standards of non-u.s. countries differ, in some cases significantly, from U.S. standards. Also, nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, market disruption, political changes, security suspensions or diplomatic developments could adversely affect a Portfolio s investments in a non-u.s. country. In the event of nationalization, expropriation or other confiscation, a Portfolio could lose its entire investment in non-u.s. securities. The more a Portfolio invests its assets in a particular currency or geographic area, the more exposure it will generally have to regional economic risks, including weather emergencies and natural disasters. For example, to the extent a Portfolio may invest more than 25% of its assets in particular countries, it may be subject to increased risks due to political, economic, social or regulatory events in those countries. Adverse developments in certain regions can also adversely affect securities of other countries whose economies appear to be unrelated. In addition, a Portfolio s investments in non-u.s. securities may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by countries outside the U.S., which could reduce the return on an investment in a Portfolio. To the extent that a Portfolio invests in real estate-related investments, such as securities of real estate-related companies, real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate operating companies (REOCs) and related instruments and derivatives, it will be subject to the risks associated with owning real estate and with the real estate industry generally. These include difficulties in valuing and disposing of real estate, the possibility of declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and local economic conditions, the possibility of adverse changes in the climate for real estate, environmental liability risks, the risk of increases in property taxes and operating expenses, possible adverse changes in zoning laws, the risk of casualty or condemnation losses, limitations on rents, the possibility of adverse changes in interest rates and in the credit markets and the possibility of borrowers paying off mortgages sooner than expected, which may lead to reinvestment of assets at lower prevailing interest rates. The value of investments in the real estate sector also may be affected by macroeconomic developments, and social and economic trends. To the extent a Portfolio invests in REITs and/ or REOCs, it will also be subject to the risk that a REIT or REOC will default on its obligations or go bankrupt. By investing in REITs and/or REOCs indirectly through a Portfolio, a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of a Portfolio, but also, indirectly, similar expenses of such REITs or REOCs. The general risks associated with investing in equity securities and liquidity risk are particularly pronounced for securities of companies with smaller market capitalizations. These companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources or they may depend on a few key employees. Securities of smaller companies may trade less frequently and in lesser volume than more widely held securities, and their values may fluctuate more sharply than other securities. They may also trade in the over-the-counter market or on a regional exchange, or may otherwise have limited liquidity. Companies with medium-sized market capitalizations also have substantial exposure to these risks. A change in the securities held by a Portfolio is known as portfolio turnover. Higher portfolio turnover involves correspondingly greater expenses to a Portfolio, including brokerage commissions or dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestments in other securities. Such sales may also adversely impact a Portfolio s after-tax returns. The trading costs and tax effects associated with portfolio turnover may adversely affect a Portfolio s performance. 18 Premier Multi-Series VIT  View more

 Thomas J. Fuccillo  President &
CEO 




  Dear Shareholder,  The US economy
expanded at an uneven pace during the six-month reporting period ended June 30, 2016. Economic activity overseas was mixed and generally lackluster. Against this backdrop, US equities posted a modest gain, whereas international developed equities
generated poor results. However, the US bond market posted a strong return during the reporting period.  For the six-month reporting period ended June 30, 2016, the
NFJ Dividend Value Portfolio (the Portfolio) returned 3.79%, underperforming the 6.30% return of the Russell 1000 Value Index over the same period.  US
gross domestic product (GDP), which is an approximation of the value of all goods and services produced in the country, the broadest measure of economic activity and a key indicator of economic performance, expanded at a revised 0.9%
annualized pace during the fourth quarter of 2015. During the reporting period economic growth then decelerated, as GDP grew at an annualized pace of 0.8% during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the US Commerce Departments initial
estimate for the second quarter of 2016 showed that GDP  released after the reporting period had ended  grew at an annualized pace of 1.2% for the second quarter of 2016. 
At its meeting in December 2015 the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. More specifically, the US
central bank increased the federal funds rate from a range between 0% and 0.25% to a range between 0.25% and 0.50%. However, since that time the Fed has paused increases in interest rates and has downgraded its projections for growth in the US for
2016. In its official statement following its meeting in June 2016 the Fed said, The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate
is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  Given generally tepid growth and low inflation outside the
US, a number of international central banks pursued highly accommodative monetary policies during the reporting period. For example, both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan introduced negative interest rates. Meanwhile, the Bank of
England (BoE) kept rates unchanged during the reporting period. However, given the June 23, 2016 referendum to leave the European Union (Brexit) and expectations for moderating growth, the BoE lowered rates to a new record
low of 0.25% at its meeting on August 3, 2016.

Table of Contents
Outlook  Nine years since the
financial crisis started, monetary easing is continuing with few signs of an end in sight. This appears to be especially true in a post-Brexit world rife with economic uncertainty and generally weak growth around the world. Against this backdrop,
investor sentiment is likely to be challenged at times. Other questions facing investors are the upcoming November elections in the US and a host of geopolitical issues. 
In such an environment, we expect investors to be in for a choppy ride. However, in our view it wont be without opportunity, especially for those with long term
outlooks, a healthy risk appetite and the latitude to invest actively. As always, we will continue to conduct extensive research and focus on quality and sustainability to help our shareholders navigate the many uncertainties around the globe. 
On behalf of Allianz Global Investors Fund Management LLC, the Portfolios investment manager, and NFJ Investment Group LLC, the Portfolios sub-adviser,
thank you for investing with us. We encourage you to consult with your financial advisor and to visit our website, us.allianzgi.com, for additional information. We remain dedicated to serving your investment needs. 
Sincerely,    

 Thomas J. Fuccillo  President & Chief
Executive Officer  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Unless otherwise noted, index returns reflect the reinvestment of income dividends and capital
gains, if any, but do not reflect fees, brokerage commissions or other expenses of investing. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NFJ Dividend Value Portfolio  For the period of January 1, 2016 through June
30, 2016, as provided by the NFJ Investment Team.   




 Portfolio Insights

 
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the NFJ Dividend Value Portfolio (the Portfolio) returned 3.79%,
underperforming the Russell 1000 Value Index (the benchmark) which returned 6.30%.  Market Overview 
US large cap equities outpaced their small cap counterparts during the reporting period as the Russell 1000 Index gained 3.74% versus the Russell 2000 Index which
appreciated 2.22%. US equities, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, suffered the worst start to a calendar year in decades, touching a 22-month low in mid-February 2016, before recovering to end the
reporting period with modest gains. The reporting period closed on a historic, somewhat unexpected note, with the United Kingdom choosing to exit the European Union on June 23. The days that followed the vote saw a spike in uncertainty, with the
S&P 500 Index dropping 5.4% in two daysa 3+ standard deviation event. As a result of the volatility in the financial markets, the Fed has taken a dovish stance on interest rates thus far in 2016 and reduced the number of rate increases it
expects in 2016 from four to two.  Portfolio Review  Relative
underperformance over the reporting period was due to negative stock selection while


sector allocation was positive. Selection across the consumer staples and information technology sectors boosted relative returns, but gains were overwhelmed by holdings in the financials and
health care sectors, which failed to keep pace with benchmark shares. Investors continued to favor more defensive and bond-proxy-like equities while rising oil prices boosted performance across the energy and materials sectors. Within the benchmark,
five sectors delivered double-digit total returns: utilities, telecom services, energy, materials and consumer staples. In terms of sector allocation, two sectors dipped into negative territory over the reporting period, including financials and
consumer discretionary. The Portfolios overweight in telecom services and underweight in financials contributed to performance results. Conversely, an underweight in utilities and overweight in consumer discretionary detracted from the
Portfolios relative performance.  Outlook  As we have done for over
26 years, NFJ Investment Group is giving prudence to its philosophy and maintaining a disciplined adherence to its investment process. Allianz Global Investors and NFJ continue to advocate that clients must take risk to generate an excess return,
and that an active approach at current valuation levels will be


necessary to generate alpha. NFJs focus on dividend-paying stocksone of the three pillars that the NFJ framework was founded on in 1989may be one solution to help investors
generate returns and protect purchasing power in an era where equity appreciation may be more challenged. Over time, the NFJ Investment Team seeks to offer a dividend premium relative to their corresponding benchmarks, in order to generate income
for investors at sound valuation levels. Additionally, dividend-paying stocks may protect investors from market volatility, potentially providing an income stream that is independent of market movements. As value equity managers, our philosophy is
to continuously style tilt toward low valuation and higher-quality equities. Over time research has shown investing in low valuation equities has generated excess return persistently across time periods and pervasively across regions worldwide
(Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny, 1994; Fama and French, 1992; Rosenberg, Reid and Lanstein, 1985). Positioning to dividends and value is time tested, and we believe it looks attractive in the current market environment dominated by financial
repression, increased volatility and historically rich valuations.

Important Information 
The NFJ Dividend Value Portfolio (the Portfolio) currently offers one share class. Shares of the Portfolio currently available to
be purchased by segregated asset accounts that fund variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America and Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York, or other affiliated or
unaffiliated insurance companies. To the extent permitted by applicable law, shares of the Portfolio also are available to be purchased by insurance dedicated fund-of-funds vehicles managed by Allianz Investment Management LLC, an affiliate of
Allianz Global Investors Fund Management LLC.  The Lipper Averages are calculated by Lipper, Inc. (Lipper). They are
based on the total return performance, with distributions reinvested and operating expenses deducted, of funds included by Lipper in the stated category. Lipper does not take into account sales charges. 
The Average Returns chart for the Portfolio assumes the initial investment was made on the first day of the Portfolios initial fiscal
year. Results assume that all dividends and capital gain distributions were reinvested. They do not take into account the effect of taxes. The benchmark cumulative return began on the last day of the month of the Portfolios inception date.
 The following disclosure provides important information regarding the Portfolios Shareholder Expense Example, which appears on the
Portfolio Summary page in this Semiannual Report. Please refer to this information when reviewing the Shareholder Expense Example for the Portfolio. 
Shareholder Expense Example  Shareholders
incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs; and (2) ongoing costs, including investment management fees, distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees, and other Portfolio expenses. The Shareholder Expense Example is intended to help shareholders
understand ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Portfolio and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Shareholder Expense Example is based on an investment of $1,000.00 invested at the
beginning of the period, as indicated, and held for the entire period through June 30, 2016.  Actual Expenses 
The information in the table for Actual Performance provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may
use the information in these columns, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000.00 (for example, an $8,600.00 account value divided by $1,000.00 = 8.6),
then multiply the result by the number in the column entitled Expenses Paid During Period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period. 
Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes 
The information in the table for Hypothetical Performance (5% return before expenses) provides information about hypothetical
account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Portfolios actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Portfolios actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses
may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Portfolio and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of other funds.  Please note that the expenses shown in
the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs. Therefore, the information for Hypothetical Performance (5% return before expenses) is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will
not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher. 
Proxy Voting  The Trusts Investment
Manager and Sub-Adviser have adopted written proxy voting policies and procedures (Proxy Policy) as required by Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Proxy Policy has been adopted by the Trust as the policies

which are available on the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov. A copy of the Trusts Form N-Q is available without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-498-5413. In addition, the Trusts Form N-Q may be reviewed and copied at
the SECs Public Reference Room in Washington, DC. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.

Calculated on average shares outstanding during the year. 


(1)
Total return is calculated assuming a purchase of a share on the first day of the period and a sale of a share on the last day of each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for purposes
of this calculation, to be reinvested. Total return includes the effect of any fee waivers and reimbursements. 


 
Total return may reflect adjustments to conform to U.S. GAAP. Total return for a period of less than one year is not annualized. 


(2)
Inclusive of custody expenses offset by credits earned on cash balances at the custodian bank. (See (1)(g) in the Notes to Financial Statements). 


(3)
Annualized. 


(4)
The amount shown for a share outstanding throughout the period is not reflective of the aggregate net realized and unrealized gain (loss) for that period due to the timing of sales and redemptions of the Portfolio
shares in relation to the fluctuating market value of the investments in the Portfolio.

insurance policies and to insurance-dedicated fund-of-funds vehicles sponsored by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life), an affiliate of the Investment Manager. AAM and Allianz Life are indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Allianz SE, a publicly-traded European insurance and financial services company. The Trust may issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest with $0.00001 par value. 
The Portfolios objective is to seek long-term growth of capital and income. There can be no assurance that the Portfolio will meet its
stated objective.  The preparation of the Portfolios financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the Portfolios financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  In the normal course of business, the Portfolio enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations that
provide general indemnifications. The Portfolios maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Portfolio that have not yet occurred. 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Portfolio: 
(a) Valuation of Investments  Portfolio
securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations are readily available are stated at market value. Market value is generally determined on the basis of official closing prices, last reported sales prices, or if no sales or
closing prices are reported, on the basis of quotes obtained from a quotation reporting system, established market makers, or independent pricing services. The Portfolios investments are valued daily using prices supplied by an independent
pricing service or broker/dealer quotations, or by using the last sale or settlement price on the exchange that is the primary market for such securities, or the mean between the last bid and ask quotations. The market value for NASDAQ Global Market
securities and NASDAQ Capital Market securities may also be calculated using the NASDAQ Official Closing Price instead of the last reported sales price. Independent pricing services use information provided by market makers or estimates of market
values obtained from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics. The Board of Trustees (the
Board) has adopted procedures for valuing portfolio securities and other financial instruments in circumstances where market quotations are not readily available (including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be
unreliable), and has delegated primary responsibility for applying the valuation methods to the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser. The Trusts Valuation Committee was established by the Board to oversee the implementation of the
Portfolios valuation methods and to make fair value determinations on behalf of the Board, as instructed by the Board. The Sub-Adviser monitors the continued appropriateness of methods applied and identifies to the Investment Manager
circumstances and events that may require fair valuation. The Investment Manager, in turn, determines if adjustments should be made in light of market changes, events affecting the issuer, or other factors. If the Investment Manager (in consultation
with the Sub-Adviser) determines that a valuation method may no longer be appropriate, another valuation method may be selected or the Valuation Committee will be convened to consider the matter and take any appropriate action in accordance with
procedures set forth by the Board. The Board shall review and ratify the appropriateness of the valuation methods and these methods may be amended or supplemented from time to time by the Valuation Committee. 
Short-term debt instruments maturing in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, if their original term to maturity was 60 days or less,
or by amortizing premiums or discounts based on their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if the original term to maturity exceeded 60 days.

(continued)     
The prices used by the Portfolio to value investments may differ from the value that would be
realized if the investments were sold, and these differences could be material to the Portfolios financial statements. The Portfolios net asset value (NAV) is normally determined as of the close of regular trading
(normally, 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on each day the NYSE is open for business.  (b) Fair Value
Measurements  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
(i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:   


 
●
 
 Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical investments that the Portfolio has the ability to
access 


 
●
 
 Level 2  valuations based on other significant observable inputs, which may include, but are not
limited to, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates or other market corroborated inputs 


 
●
 
 Level 3  valuations based on significant unobservable inputs (including the Sub-Advisers or
Valuation Committees own assumptions and securities whose price was determined by using a single brokers quote) 
The valuation techniques used by the Portfolio to measure fair value during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were intended to maximize the
use of observable inputs and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The Portfolios policy is to recognize transfers between
levels at the end of the reporting period. An investment assets or liabilitys level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level input, individually or in aggregate, that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The objective of fair value measurement remains the same even when there is a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability and regardless of the valuation techniques used. Investments categorized as Level 1 or 2
as of period end may have been transferred between Level 1 and 2 since the prior period due to changes in the valuation method utilized in valuing the investments.
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
securities. The following are certain inputs and techniques that the Portfolio generally uses to evaluate how to classify each major category of assets and liabilities for Level 2 and Level 3, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Equity Securities (Common and Preferred Stock)  Equity securities traded in inactive markets are valued using inputs which
include broker-dealer quotes, recently executed transactions adjusted for changes in the benchmark index, or evaluated price quotes received from independent pricing services that take into account the integrity of the market sector and issuer, the
individual characteristics of the security, and information received from broker-dealers and other market sources pertaining to the issuer or security. To the extent that these inputs are observable, the values of equity securities are categorized
as Level 2. To the extent that these inputs are unobservable, the values are categorized as Level 3.  (c) Investment Transactions and Investment Income
 Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on investments are determined on an identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Dividend income on the Statement of Operations is shown net of any foreign taxes withheld on income from foreign securities. Interest income and expenses are recorded on an accrual
basis. (d) Federal Income Taxes  The
Portfolio intends to distribute all of its taxable income and to comply with the other requirements of Subchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for
U.S. federal income taxes is required. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes establishes for all entities, including pass through
entities such as the Portfolio, a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of positions taken in filing tax returns (including whether an entity is taxable in a particular jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax
disclosures. In accordance with provisions set forth under U.S. GAAP, the Investment Manager has reviewed the Portfolios tax positions for all open tax years. As of June 30, 2016, the Portfolios federal income tax returns for the prior
three years, as applicable, remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The Portfolio has recorded no liability for net unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax positions it has taken.

(continued)     
(e) Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders 
The Portfolio declares dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains, if any, at least
annually. The Portfolio records dividends and distributions on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains is determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. GAAP. These book-tax differences are considered either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital
accounts based on their federal income tax treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes, they are
reported as dividends and/or distributions to shareholders from return of capital.  (f) Repurchase Agreements 
The Portfolio is a party to Master Repurchase Agreements (Master Repo Agreements) with select counterparties. The Master Repo
Agreements maintain provisions for initiation, income payments, events of default, and maintenance of collateral. The Portfolio enters
into transactions, under the Master Repo Agreements, with its custodian bank or with securities brokerage firms whereby it purchases securities under agreements to resell such securities at an agreed upon price and date (repurchase
agreements). The Portfolio, through its custodian, takes possession of securities collateralizing the repurchase agreement. Such agreements are carried at the contract amount in the financial statements, which is considered to represent
fair-value. Collateral pledged (the securities received), which consists primarily of U.S. government obligations and asset-backed securities, is held by the custodian bank for the benefit of the Portfolio until maturity of the repurchase agreement.
Provisions of the repurchase agreements and the procedures adopted by the Portfolio require that the market value of the collateral, including accrued interest thereon, be sufficient in the event of default by the counterparty. If the counterparty
defaults under the Master Repo Agreements, and the value of the collateral declines or if the counterparty enters an insolvency proceeding, realization of the collateral by the Portfolio may be delayed or limited. The gross value is included in the
Portfolios Schedule of Investments. The value of the related collateral exceeded the value of the repurchase agreements outstanding at June 30, 2016.
(g) Custody Credits on Cash Balances  The
Portfolio had an expense offset arrangement with its custodian bank, whereby uninvested cash balances earned credits that reduce monthly custodian and accounting agent expenses. Had these cash balances been invested in income-producing
securities, they would have generated income for the Portfolio. Cash overdraft charges, if any, are included in custodian and accounting agent fees. 
2. Principal Risks  In the normal course
of business, the Portfolio trades financial instruments and enters into financial transactions where risk of potential loss exists due to, among other things, changes in the market (market risk) or failure of the other party to a transaction to
perform (counterparty risk). The market values of securities may decline due to general market conditions (market risk) which are not
specifically related to a particular company, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment. They may also decline
due to factors that affect a particular industry or industries, such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry. Equity securities and equity-related investments generally have greater market price
volatility than fixed income securities.  The Portfolio is exposed to counterparty risk, or the risk that an institution or other entity
with which the Portfolio has unsettled or open transactions will default. The potential loss to the Portfolio could exceed the value of the financial assets recorded in the Portfolios financial statements. Financial assets, which potentially
expose the Portfolio to counterparty risk, consist principally of cash due from counterparties and investments. The Sub-Adviser seeks to minimize the Portfolios counterparty risk by performing reviews of each counterparty and by minimizing
concentration of counterparty risk by undertaking transactions with multiple customers and counterparties on recognized and reputable exchanges. Delivery of securities sold is only made once the Portfolio has received a payment. Payment is made on a
purchase once the securities have been delivered by the counterparty. The trade will fail if either party fails to meet its obligation.
The counterparty risk associated with certain contracts may be reduced by master netting arrangements to the extent that if an event
of default occurs, all amounts with the counterparty are terminated and settled on a net basis. The Portfolios overall exposure to counterparty risk with respect to transactions subject to master netting arrangements can change
substantially within a short period, as it is affected by each transaction subject to the arrangement.

3. Investment Manager/Sub-Adviser/Distributor Fees & Deferred Compensation 
The Trust, on behalf of the Portfolio, has an Investment Management Agreement (the Agreement) with the Investment Manager. Subject
to the supervision of the Portfolios Board, the Investment Manager is responsible for managing, either directly or through others selected by it, the Portfolios investment activities, business affairs and administrative matters. Pursuant
to the Agreement, the Investment Manager receives an annual fee, payable monthly (net of any reimbursements or recoupment), at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Portfolios average daily net assets. Effective January 1, 2016, the Investment
Manager contractually agreed to observe, through April 30, 2017, an irrevocable waiver of a portion of its management fees, which reduces the contractual rate by 0.05%, from 0.70% to 0.65% of average daily net assets. For the six months ended June
30, 2016, the Portfolio paid effective investment management fees at a rate of 0.65% of the portfolios daily net assets.  The
Investment Manager has retained the Sub-Adviser to manage the Portfolios investments. Subject to the supervision of the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for making all of the Portfolios investment decisions. The
Investment Manager, not the Portfolio, pays a portion of the fees it receives as Investment Manager to the Sub-Adviser in return for its services. 
Allianz Global Investors Distributors LLC (the Distributor), an affiliate of AAM, the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser,
serves as the distributor of the Trusts shares. The Trust has adopted a Distribution and Servicing Plan (the Plan). The Plan permits the Trust, or the Distributor acting as agent of the Trust, to make payments to participating
insurance companies, plan sponsors and other financial institutions as compensation for services rendered or expenses borne in connection with certain enumerated services, which include the provision of personal services to segregated asset account
shareholders and maintenance of shareholder accounts (servicing fees). The Plan permits the share class currently offered by the Portfolio to pay servicing fees at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the Portfolios average daily net
assets. Payments are accrued daily and paid monthly. Trustees do not currently receive any pension or retirement benefits from the Trust.
The Trust has adopted a deferred compensation plan for the Trustees that went into place on January 1, 2015 and permits the Trustees to defer their receipt of compensation from the Trust, at their election, in accordance with the terms of the plan.
Under the plan, each Trustee may elect not to receive all or a portion of his or her fees from the Trust on a current basis but to receive in a subsequent period chosen by the Trustee an amount equal to the value of such compensation if such
compensation had been invested in one or more series of the Allianz Funds Multi-Strategy Trust, AllianzGI Institutional Multi-Series Trust or Allianz Funds, selected by the Trustees from and after the normal payment dates for such compensation. The
deferred compensation program is structured such that the Trust remains in substantially the same financial position whether Trustee fees are paid when earned or deferred. 
4. Expense Limitation  During the
reporting period, the Trust and the Investment Manager were subject to an Expense Limitation Agreement whereby the Investment Manager agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse the Portfolio through April 30, 2017 to the extent that total annual
Portfolio operating expenses (after application of fee waiver described in note 3 above), excluding interest, tax and extraordinary expenses, and certain credits and other expenses, exceeded 1.00% of the Portfolios average daily net assets.
The Investment Manager, as per the Expense Limitation Agreement, may recoup waived/reimbursed amounts for a period of up to three years, provided total expenses, including such recoupment, do not exceed the annual expense limit in effect at the time
of such waiver/recoupment.  5. Investments in Securities 
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, purchases and sales of investments, other than short-term securities, were $7,480,252 and $10,458,374,
respectively.  6. Income Tax Information
At June 30, 2016, the cost basis of portfolio securities for federal income tax purposes was $82,025,766. Gross unrealized appreciation was
$11,304,863, gross unrealized depreciation was $5,581,625, and net unrealized appreciation was $5,723,238. The difference between book and tax basis was attributable to wash sale loss deferrals.

7. Affiliated Transactions 
At June 30, 2016, six affiliated insurance-dedicated fund-of-fund vehicles sponsored by Allianz Life owned 100% of the Portfolio. Portfolio
share subscription and redemption activity by the fund-of-fund vehicles with respect to Portfolio shares could have a material impact on the Portfolio. 
8. Borrowings  On July 31, 2015, the
Trust entered into a new credit agreement (the Northern Trust Agreement), among the Trust, AllianzGI Institutional Multi-Series Trust, Allianz Funds and Allianz Funds Multi-Strategy Trust, as borrowers (collectively, the AllianzGI
Borrowers and certain series thereof, each AllianzGI Borrower Fund), and Northern Trust Company, as lender, for a committed line of credit. The Northern Trust Agreement permits the AllianzGI Borrowers to borrow up to $200 million
in aggregate, subject to (i) a requirement that each AllianzGI Borrower Funds asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness be 300% or higher, and (ii) certain other limitations and conditions. Each AllianzGI
Borrower Fund is obligated to pay interest on any amounts borrowed under the facility at the greater of (i) the federal funds overnight rate plus 1.00% or (ii) 1.50%, subject to upward adjustment when past-due payments are outstanding. The AllianzGI
Borrowers will also pay a usage fee at an annualized rate of 0.15% on undrawn amounts, allocated pro rata among the AllianzGI Borrower Funds on the basis of net assets. Amounts borrowed may be repaid and reborrowed on a revolving basis during the
term of the facility. The Portfolio did not utilize the line of credit during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Northern Trust Agreement had an original maturity date of July 29, 2016, which was extended by 90 days to October 27, 2016, unless
further extended, or renewed with revised terms. 9. Subsequent Events 
In preparing these financial statements, the Portfolios management has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or
disclosure through the date the financial statements were issued. There were no other subsequent events identified that require
recognition or disclosure.

Matters Relating to the Trustees Consideration of the Investment Management and
Portfolio Management Agreements (unaudited)  NFJ Dividend Value Portfolio 
   
The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), requires that both the full Board of Trustees (the Board
or the Trustees) and a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust (the Independent Trustees), voting separately, annually approve the continuation of (i) the Trusts Investment Management
Agreement (the Investment Management Agreement) on behalf of NFJ Dividend Value Portfolio (the Portfolio) with Allianz Global Investors Fund Management LLC (the Investment Manager) and (ii) the Sub-Advisory
Agreement between the Investment Manager and NFJ Investment Group LLC (the Sub-Adviser) with respect to the Portfolio. The Investment Management Agreement and the Sub-Advisory Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the
Agreements.  The Trusts Contracts Committee, which is comprised of all of the Independent Trustees, met on March 10, 2016
and March 22, 2016 with independent counsel to discuss the materials provided by the Investment Manager in response to the Independent Trustees written request for information regarding the annual renewal. Representatives from fund management
attended portions of those meetings to review, among other topics, the comparative fee and expense information and comparative performance information prepared and provided by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge) for the
Portfolio using its Broadridge peer universe for performance and expense comparisons.  At an in-person meeting held on March 22, 2016 (the
March Meeting), the Board and the Independent Trustees unanimously approved the continuation of the Agreements for an additional one-year period from April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017.
The material factors and conclusions that formed the basis of these approvals for the Portfolio are discussed below. 
The Independent Trustees were assisted in their evaluation of the Agreements and the factors that they deemed to be material, including those
factors described below, by independent legal counsel, from whom they received separate legal advice and with whom they met separately from fund management during their contract review meeting. 
In connection with their deliberations regarding the approval of the Agreements, the Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, considered
such information and factors as they believed, in light of the legal advice furnished to them and their own business judgment, to be relevant. As described below, the Trustees considered the nature, quality and extent of the various investment
management, administrative and other services performed by the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser under the Agreements.  In connection
with their contract review meetings, the Trustees received and relied upon materials provided by the Investment Manager including, among other items: (i) information provided by Broadridge, an independent third party, for the Portfolio on the
investment performance of a group of funds with investment classifications and/or objectives comparable to those of the Portfolio identified by Broadridge (the Broadridge performance universe), the performance of applicable benchmark
indices and the total return investment performance (based on net assets) of the Portfolio for various time periods; (ii) information on the Portfolios management fees and other expenses and information compiled by Broadridge, as applicable,
on the management fees and other expenses of comparable funds identified by Broadridge; (iii) information regarding the investment performance and fees for other funds and accounts managed by the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser, including
institutional and separate accounts, with a similar investment objective and policies to those of the Portfolio; (iv) an estimate of profitability to the Investment Manager from its relationship with the Portfolio for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2015; (v) descriptions of various functions performed by the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser for the Portfolio, such as portfolio management, compliance monitoring and portfolio trading practices; (vi) information regarding the
overall organization of the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser, including, without limitation, information regarding senior management, portfolio managers and other personnel providing or proposed to provide investment management, administrative
and other services and corporate ownership and business operations unrelated to the Portfolio; (vii) a fact card for the Portfolio including, among other information, performance comparisons between the Portfolio and its Broadridge peer group, total
expense ratio and management fee comparisons between the Portfolio and its Broadridge peer group and trends in profitability to the Investment Manager of its advisory relationship with the Portfolio; and (viii) a Focus Group Scorecard
that presented the Portfolios performance with respect to selected metrics against Broadridge peers.  The Trustees
conclusions as to the approval of the Agreements were based on a comprehensive consideration of all information provided to the Trustees and were not the result of any single factor. Some of the factors that figured particularly in the
Trustees deliberations are described below, although individual Trustees may have evaluated the information presented differently from one another, giving different weights to various factors. The Trustees recognized that the fee arrangements
for the Portfolio are the result of years of review and discussion between the Trustees and the Investment Manager, that certain aspects of such arrangements may receive greater scrutiny in some years than in others and that the Trustees
conclusions may be based, in part, on their consideration of the same arrangements during the course of the year and in prior years. The Trustees also took into account that the Investment Manager had proposed the continuation of expense caps for
the Portfolio. The Trustees also considered the risk profile of the Portfolio.

Performance Information 
Performance results for the Portfolio reviewed by the Trustees are discussed below. The comparative performance information was prepared and
provided by Broadridge and was not independently verified by the Trustees. Due to the passage of time, these performance results may differ from the performance results for more recent periods, including those shown elsewhere in this report. The
Trustees reviewed, among other information, comparative information showing performance for Portfolio shares against its Broadridge performance universe for the one-year period ended September 30, 2015. For the Portfolio, performance was below
median (in the fifth quintile) for the one-year and three-year periods. In addition, the Trustees considered matters bearing on the
Portfolio and its advisory arrangements at their meetings throughout the year, including a review of performance data at each regular meeting. 
As part of their review, the Trustees examined the ability of the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser to provide high-quality investment
management and other services to the Portfolio. Among other information, the Trustees considered the investment philosophy and research and decision making processes of the Sub-Adviser; the experience of key advisory personnel of the Sub-Adviser
responsible for portfolio management of the Portfolio; the ability of the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser to attract and retain capable personnel; and the capability of the senior management and staff of the Investment Manager and the
Sub-Adviser. In addition, the Trustees reviewed the quality of the Investment Managers and the Sub-Advisers services with respect to regulatory compliance and ability to comply with the investment and compliance policies and procedures
of the Portfolio; the nature, extent and quality of certain administrative services the Investment Manager is responsible for providing to the Portfolio; and conditions that might affect the ability of the Investment Manager or the Sub-Adviser to
provide high quality services to the Portfolio in the future under the Agreements, including, but not limited to, each organizations respective financial condition and operational stability. Based on the foregoing, the Trustees concluded that
the Sub-Advisers investment process, research capabilities and philosophy were well-suited to the Portfolio given its respective investment objectives and policies, and that the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser would be able to continue
to meet and/or meet any reasonably foreseeable obligations under each Agreement.  Fee and Expense Information 
In assessing the reasonableness of the Portfolios fees under the Agreements, the Trustees considered, among other information, the
Portfolios management fee and total expense ratio as a percentage of average daily net assets and the management fees and total expense ratios of a peer group of funds based on information provided by Broadridge. The Trustees also noted the
expense limitation agreement observed by the Investment Manager for the Portfolio that caps the total annual expenses of the Portfolio. The Trustees also considered, among other items: (i) the level of the Portfolios sub-advisory fees; (ii)
the allocation of the management fee between the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser, and the services provided by the Investment Manager, on the one hand, and the Sub-Adviser, on the other hand; and (iii) that the Investment Manager (and not the
Portfolio) pays the Sub-Advisory fee.  In comparing the Portfolio to its Broadridge peers, with respect to expenses, the Trustees noted
that the Portfolio was not charged a separate administration fee, recognizing that their management fee includes a component for administrative services, while many peer funds in the Broadridge category have separate advisory and administration
agreements with separate fees.  The Trustees also considered information showing the advisory fees charged by the Investment Manager and
Sub-Adviser to other funds and accounts, including institutional and separate accounts, with a similar investment objective and policies to those of the Portfolio. In comparing these fees, the Trustees considered information provided by the
Investment Manager as to the generally broader and more extensive services provided to the Portfolio in comparison to institutional or separate accounts, the higher demands placed on the Investment Managers investment personnel and trading
infrastructure as a result of the daily cash in-flows and outflows of the Portfolio, the greater entrepreneurial risk in managing mutual funds and the impact on the Investment Manager and expenses associated with the more extensive regulatory regime
to which the Portfolio is subject in comparison to institutional or separate accounts.  The Trustees reviewed information provided by
Broadridge comparing the Portfolios management fee and ratios of total expenses to net assets (total expense ratios) to those of a group of comparable funds for the most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The Trustees
noted that the Broadridge data takes into account any fee reductions or expense limitations that were in effect during the Portfolios last fiscal year. The fee and expense results discussed below were prepared and provided by Broadridge, as
applicable, and were not independently verified by the Trustees. The Portfolios fee and expense rankings are discussed below relative to the median of the Broadridge-selected group of comparable funds. The Portfolios management fees and
total expense ratios (taking fee waivers and/or expense limitations into account) were approximately at median.

Matters Relating to the Trustees Consideration of the Investment Management and Portfolio Management
Agreements (unaudited) (continued)  NFJ Dividend Value Portfolio 
   
The Trustees considered the estimated profitability to the Investment Manager of its
relationship with the Portfolio and determined that such profitability did not appear to be excessive. The Trustees considered the extent to which the Investment Manager and Sub-Adviser may realize economies of scale or other efficiencies in
managing and supporting the Portfolio. The Trustees took into account that, as an open-end investment company, the Portfolio intends to raise additional assets, so as the assets of the Portfolio grow over time, certain economies of scale and other
efficiencies may be realized through spreading certain fixed costs across a larger asset base or across a variety of products and services, while also taking into account the expense limitation arrangements observed by the Investment Manager for the
Portfolio. Additionally, the Trustees considered so-called fall-out benefits to the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates, such as reputational value derived from serving as Investment Manager and Sub-Adviser to the
Portfolio.  After reviewing these and other factors described herein, the Trustees concluded, within the context of their overall
conclusions regarding the Agreements, that they were satisfied with the Investment Managers and Sub-Advisers responses and efforts relating to the investment performance of the Portfolio, including efforts to improve performance. The
Trustees also concluded that the fees payable under each Agreement represent reasonable compensation in light of the nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Investment Manager or Sub-Adviser, as the case may be, and should be
continued. Based on their evaluation of factors that they deemed to be material, including, but not limited to, those factors described above, the Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, unanimously concluded that the continuation of the
Agreements with respect to the Portfolio were in the interests of the Portfolio and its shareholders, and determined to approve such continuation. 
In addition, at an in-person meeting held on June 8, 2016 (the June Meeting), the Board and the Independent Trustees unanimously
approved the extension of the Agreements for an additional three-month period from April 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017 in order to align the terms of the Agreements for all series of the Trust. The Trustees noted that, at the March Meeting, it
had considered and unanimously approved the renewal of the Agreements with respect to the Portfolio for an additional one-year period through March 31, 2017. The Trustees further noted that the Investment Manager had requested that the Board and the
Independent Trustees approve the extension of the Agreements with respect to the Portfolio for an additional three months (i.e., through June 30, 2017) solely for the purpose of reducing the number of meetings where the Board must consider
annual contract renewals for the Trust and the other investment companies overseen by the Trustees. The Independent Trustees were assisted
in their evaluation of the Agreements and the factors that they deemed to be material by independent legal counsel, from whom they received separate legal advice and with whom they met separately from fund management during their contract review
meeting.  In connection with their deliberations regarding the extension of the Agreements, the Trustees, including the Independent
Trustees, considered such information and factors as they believed, in light of the legal advice furnished to them and their own business judgment, to be relevant. As described below, the Trustees considered the nature, quality and extent of the
various investment management, administrative and other services performed by the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser under the Agreements. 
The Trustees took into account information prepared by the Investment Manager, including memoranda and other materials addressing the factors
set out above and provided to the Trustees prior to the meeting. The information related to the extension of the Agreements provided to the Trustees included, among other things, detailed information about the advisory roles of the Investment
Manager and the Sub-Adviser, updated since the March Meeting, and updated performance information for the Portfolio. The Trustees also took into account information provided to the Trustees at prior Board meetings, including its March Meeting.
That information described, among other things, the services to be provided by the Investment Manager, as well as the Investment Managers investment personnel, proposed management fee, performance information and other matters. During the June
Meeting, the Trustees met with senior representatives of the Investment Manager to discuss the Agreements and the information provided.
After reviewing these materials in relation to their consideration of the factors described herein, the Trustees concluded, within the context
of their overall conclusions regarding the Agreements, that they were satisfied with the Investment Managers and Sub-Advisers responses and efforts relating to the investment performance of the Portfolio, including efforts to improve
performance. The Trustees also concluded that the fees payable under each Agreement represent reasonable compensation in light of the nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Investment Manager or Sub-Adviser, as the case may be, and
should be extended. Based on their evaluation of factors that they deemed to be material, including, but not limited to, those factors described herein, the Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, unanimously concluded that the extension
of the Agreements with respect to the Portfolio were in the interests of the Portfolio and its shareholders, and determined to approve such extension.

 Thomas J. Fuccillo  President &
CEO 




  Dear Shareholder,  The US economy
expanded at an uneven pace during the six-month reporting period ended June 30, 2016. Economic activity overseas was mixed and generally lackluster. Against this backdrop, US equities posted a modest gain, whereas international developed equities
generated poor results. However, the US bond market posted a strong return during the reporting period.  For the six-month reporting period ended June 30, 2016, the
RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio (the Portfolio) returned 1.08% underperforming the blended benchmark index, 35% S&P 500/20% MSCI EAFE/5% MSCI EM/25% Barclays US Aggregate Government/10% Barclays US Corporate Bond/5% JPM
EMBI+ Index, which returned 3.55% over the same period.  US gross domestic product (GDP), which is an approximation of the value of all goods and
services produced in the country, the broadest measure of economic activity and a key indicator of economic performance, expanded at a revised 0.9% annualized pace during the fourth quarter of 2015. During the reporting period economic growth then
decelerated, as GDP grew at an annualized pace of 0.8% during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the US Commerce Departments initial estimate for the second quarter of 2016 showed that GDP  released after the reporting period had
ended  grew at an annualized pace of 1.2% for the second quarter of 2016.  At its meeting in December 2015 the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) raised
interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. More specifically, the US central bank increased the federal funds rate from a range between 0% and 0.25% to a range between 0.25% and 0.50%. However, since that time the Fed has paused increases
in interest rates and has downgraded its projections for growth in the US for 2016. In its official statement following its meeting in June 2016 the Fed said, The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will
warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. 
Given generally tepid growth and low inflation outside the US, a number of international central banks pursued highly accommodative monetary policies during the
reporting period. For example, both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan introduced negative interest rates. Meanwhile, the Bank of England (BoE) kept rates unchanged during the reporting period. However, given the
June 23, 2016 referendum to leave the European Union (Brexit) and expectations for moderating growth, the BoE lowered rates to a new record low of 0.25% at its meeting on August 3, 2016.

Outlook  Nine years since the
financial crisis started, monetary easing is continuing with few signs of an end in sight. This appears to be especially true in a post-Brexit world rife with economic uncertainty and generally weak growth around the world. Against this backdrop,
investor sentiment is likely to be challenged at times. Other questions facing investors are the upcoming November elections in the US and a host of geopolitical issues. 
In such an environment, we expect investors to be in for a choppy ride. However, in our view it wont be without opportunity, especially for those with long term
outlooks, a healthy risk appetite and the latitude to invest actively. As always, we will continue to conduct extensive research and focus on quality and sustainability to help our shareholders navigate the many uncertainties around the globe. 
On behalf of Allianz Global Investors Fund Management LLC, the Portfolios investment manager and Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC, the Portfolios
sub-adviser, thank you for investing with us. We encourage you to consult with your financial advisor and to visit our website, us.allianzgi.com, for additional information. We remain dedicated to serving your investment needs. 
Sincerely,    

 Thomas Fuccillo  President & Chief
Executive Officer  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Unless otherwise noted, index returns reflect the reinvestment of income dividends and

RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio  For the period of January 1,
2016 through June 30, 2016, as provided by the Multi-Asset US Group.   




 Portfolio Insights

 
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio (the Portfolio)
gained 1.08%, underperforming the 35% S&P 500 Index/20% MSCI EAFE Index/5% MSCI EM Index/25% Barclays US Aggregate Government Bond Index/10% Barclays US Corporate Bond Index/5% JPM EMBI+ Index (the blended benchmark index), which
returned 3.55%.  Strategy Recap  The RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT
Portfolio (DMAP) seeks to provide enhanced risk-adjusted returns and risk mitigation relative to a global 60% equities/40% fixed-income benchmark. To achieve this objective, the Portfolio dynamically allocates its assets based on the investment
management teams assessment of asset class trends and their underlying fundamentals. The strategy favors riskier asset classes when trends and fundamentals are positive and becomes more defensive in its positioning when they are not. The
investment team has the ability to dynamically adjust the equity allocation up to 65% when markets are favorable and down to 10% in times of market stress. 
Market Overview  During the reporting period, equities experienced bouts of
volatility while global bonds rallied, boosted in part by more aggressive monetary easing from developed-country central banks. Initially, concerns about a slowdown in China and a further decline in oil prices contributed to a sell-off in equities
from the start of 2016 through March. Despite this early volatility, many equity markets subsequently recovered losses as the reporting period progressed, helped by a recovery in oil and more sanguine forecasts for global growth. However, in late
June 2016, news that the UK had voted in favor of leaving the EU contributed to another brief decline in equities. Ultimately, US equities ended the reporting period in positive territory, as measured by the S&P 500 Index which was up 3.84%.
However, equities in Japan in local currency terms declined 19.47%, as measured by the MSCI Japan Index, and equities in Europe fell in local currency terms by 3.75%, as measured by the MSCI Europe Index. The MSCI EAFE Index as measured in local
currency terms posted a negative result of 7.21% while the losses were less pronounced in dollar terms in light of modest dollar weakness for the period, down 4.42% in USD. For the reporting period, fixed income returns outpaced equities, both
globally and in the US, returning 8.96% and 5.31%, respectively, as measured by the Barclays Global Aggregate and Barclays US Aggregate Bond Indices. In the US, weaker than expected US jobs data early in the reporting period contributed to delayed
expectations of interest rate increases by the Fed lending support to US Treasuries, which


finished the period up 5.37%, according to the Barclays Aggregate Bond Treasury Index, and outperforming US equities which returned 3.84%, as measured by the S&P 500 Index. Within global
bonds, emerging market bonds denominated in dollars were one of the best performers returning 12.29%, as measured by the JPM EMBI+.  Portfolio Review 
In global equities, the Portfolio entered the reporting period with an underweight of 55% versus 60% for the benchmark. The Portfolio had a reduced emphasis on both
developed equities outside the US with a weight of 18% versus a weight of 20% for the benchmark and emerging market equities with a weight of 1% versus 5% for the benchmark. Conversely, the Portfolio was modestly overweight US large cap equities
with a 36% weight versus a 35% weight for the benchmark. During the reporting period, equity positions were broadly decreased amidst the early 2016 sell-off with underweights to US and EAFE reaching -10% (25% versus 35% benchmark) and -12% (8%
versus 20% benchmark). Exposures to both were subsequently increased, although EAFE remained 9% underweight at just 11% compared to a benchmark of 20% at the end of the reporting period. US Equities ended the reporting period roughly equal weighted
versus the benchmark at 35% of the Portfolio.  In fixed income, the Portfolio entered the reporting period with an underweight of 31%, versus 40% for the benchmark,
reflecting underweights to US government bonds with a weight of 18%, versus 25% for the benchmark, and corporate bonds with a weight of 7% versus 10% for the benchmark. Meanwhile the Portfolios exposure to emerging market debt was roughly in
line with the benchmarks 5% weight. As the Portfolio was de-risked in the early year sell-off, allocations to treasuries and cash were increased, reaching 36% and 20%, respectively. By the end of the reporting period, US Government bonds were
reduced to a 10% portfolio weight versus 25% benchmark weight. Conversely, the Portfolio ended the reporting period with overweights to emerging market bonds with a portfolio weight of 8%, versus 5% for the benchmark, and US Corporates with a weight
of 15% versus 10% for the benchmark.  In the Portfolios opportunistic segment, which represents fixed income or equity investments that are outside the
benchmark, a roughly 4% weight to Italian government bonds was held at the beginning of the reporting period, although the position was closed out during the period in favor of an allocation to US high yield bonds. Real Estate Investment Trusts
(REITs) were added early in the reporting period and ended with a 4% weight.

While the Portfolio ultimately ended the reporting period with a return below the benchmark, the result included a
combination of detractors and contributors. The primary detractor from relative results over the reporting period was the intra-period underweight to equities as markets rallied off their early year declines. The preponderance of underperformance
was accrued in March 2016 when developed equity markets gained around 7% and emerging markets topped 13%, thus the Portfolios defensive position detracted. The effect was partially offset by the contributive effects of being overweight
emerging market bonds, which gained over 12% in the first half of 2016. Positioning effects in the Portfolios opportunistic exposure also added modestly.  In
terms of absolute performance, all but one of the asset classes in the Portfolios benchmark posted gains over the reporting period. In developed equities, the US market, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, gained 3.84%, while markets outside
the US, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index declined 4.42%. US fixed income also ended higher, as measured by the Barclays Capital US Government Bond (5.22%) and US Corporate Investment Grade (7.68%) Indices. Emerging market equities and fixed income
respectively gained 6.41% and 12.29%, as measured by the MSCI EM and JPM EMBI+ Indices (in USD).  Outlook 
While in the initial aftermath of the UK referendum many risk markets seemed to ignore the result, we expect that the triumph of the leave camp will have real
and lasting economic and political effects. In the near term, we believe it may contribute to slower global economic growth and more accommodative monetary policy around the world. In addition, we believe that the political fallout may also
contribute to bouts of higher volatility across asset markets through year-end.  The US and Asia may be less directly affected by the political swings in Europe.
However, we have seen repercussions in these markets as well. The Fed has signaled that it is on hold for the near future and awaiting developments in global markets before resuming its interest rate hiking cycle. Our current firm view is for one 25
basis-point hike by year-end. In Japan, the Yen has been a beneficiary of the global flight to quality in the aftermath of the UK referendum.  From an investment
perspective, the Portfolio entered the third quarter with underweights to global equities and US treasuries, an overweight to US Corporate and emerging market bonds and opportunistic exposure to US high yield bonds and REITS.

Important Information  The RCM Dynamic
Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio (the Portfolio) currently offers one share class. Shares of the Portfolio currently are available to be purchased by segregated asset accounts that fund variable annuity contracts and variable life
insurance policies issued by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America and Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York, or other affiliated or unaffiliated insurance companies. To the extent permitted by applicable law, shares of the
Portfolio also are available to be purchased by insurance dedicated fund-of-funds vehicles managed by Allianz Investment Management LLC, an affiliate of Allianz Global Investors Fund Management LLC. 
The Lipper Averages are calculated by Lipper, Inc. (Lipper). They are based on the total return performance, with
distributions reinvested and operating expenses deducted, of funds included by Lipper in the stated category. Lipper does not take into account sales charges. 
The Average Returns chart for the Portfolio assumes the initial investment was made on the first day of the Portfolios initial fiscal
year. Results assume that all dividends and capital gain distributions were reinvested. They do not take into account the effect of taxes. The benchmark cumulative return began on the last day of the month of the Portfolios inception date.
 The following disclosure provides important information regarding the Portfolios Shareholder Expense Example, which appears on the
Portfolio Summary page in this Semiannual Report. Please refer to this information when reviewing the Shareholder Expense Example for the Portfolio. 
Shareholder Expense Example  Shareholders
incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs; and (2) ongoing costs, including investment management fees, distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees, and other Portfolio expenses. The Shareholder Expense Example is intended to help shareholders
understand ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Portfolio and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Shareholder Expense Example is based on an investment of $1,000.00 invested at the
beginning of the period, as indicated, and held for the entire period through June 30, 2016.  Actual Expenses 
The information in the table for Actual Performance provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may
use the information in these columns, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000.00 (for example, an $8,600.00 account value divided by $1,000.00 = 8.6),
then multiply the result by the number in the column entitled Expenses Paid During Period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period. 
Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes 
The information in the table for Hypothetical Performance (5% return before expenses) provides information about hypothetical
account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Portfolios actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Portfolios actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses
may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Portfolio and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of other funds.  Please note that the expenses shown in
the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs. Therefore, the information for Hypothetical Performance (5% return before expenses) is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will

RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio June 30, 2016
(unaudited)    1. Organization and
Significant Accounting Policies  Premier Multi-Series VIT (the Trust) was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on
May 30, 2012. As of June 30, 2016, the Trust consisted of two separate investment series. These financial statements pertain to the RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio (the Portfolio). Prior to commencing operations on April 27,
2015, the Portfolio had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and registration as a diversified, open-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and accordingly, follows the
investment company accounting and reporting guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 946 Financial Services - the Investment Companies. Allianz Global
Investors Fund Management LLC (the Investment Manager) and Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC (AllianzGI U.S. or the Sub-Adviser), an affiliate of the Investment Manager, serve as the Portfolios investment
manager and sub-adviser, respectively, and are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Allianz Asset Management of America L.P. (AAM). The Portfolio currently offers one share class. Shares of the Portfolio currently are sold to
segregated asset accounts of insurance companies that fund variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies and to insurance-dedicated fund-of-funds vehicles sponsored by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz
Life), an affiliate of the Investment Manager. AAM and Allianz Life are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Allianz SE, a publicly-traded European insurance and financial services company. The Trust may issue an unlimited number of shares
of beneficial interest with $0.00001 par value. The Portfolio sold and issued 1,500,000 shares of beneficial interest to Allianz Funds Investments, Inc. (AFI) at an aggregate purchase price of $15,000,000.
The Portfolios objective is to seek long term capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the Portfolio will meet its stated
objective.  The preparation of the Portfolios financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the Portfolios financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  In the normal course of business, the Portfolio enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations that provide
general indemnifications. The Portfolios maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Portfolio that have not yet occurred. 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Portfolio: 
(a) Valuation of Investments  Portfolio
securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations are readily available are stated at market value. Market value is generally determined on the basis of official closing prices, last reported sales prices, or if no sales or
closing prices are reported, on the basis of quotes obtained from a quotation reporting system, established market makers, or independent pricing services. Investments in mutual funds are valued at the net asset value (NAV) as reported
on each business day. The Portfolios investments are valued daily using prices supplied by an independent pricing service or broker/dealer quotations, or by using the last sale or settlement price on the exchange that is the primary market for
such securities, or the mean between the last bid and ask quotations. The market value for NASDAQ Global Market securities and NASDAQ Capital Market securities may also be calculated using the NASDAQ Official Closing Price instead of the last
reported sales price. Independent pricing services use information provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics. Exchange traded futures are
valued at the price determined by the relevant exchange.  The Board of Trustees (the Board) has adopted procedures for valuing
portfolio securities and other financial instruments in circumstances where market quotations are not readily available (including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable), and has delegated primary responsibility for
applying the valuation methods to the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser. The Trusts Valuation Committee was established by the Board to oversee the implementation of the Portfolios valuation methods and to make fair value
determinations on behalf of the Board, as instructed by the Board. The Sub-Adviser monitors the continued appropriateness of methods applied and identifies to the Investment Manager circumstances and events that may require fair valuation. The
Investment Manager, in turn, determines if adjustments should be made in light of market changes, events affecting the issuer, or other factors. If the Investment Manager (in consultation with the Sub-Adviser) determines that a valuation method may
no longer be appropriate, another valuation method may be selected or the Valuation Committee will be convened to consider the matter and take any appropriate action in accordance with procedures set forth by the Board. The Board shall review and
ratify the appropriateness of the valuation methods and these methods may be amended or supplemented from time to time by the Valuation Committee.

(unaudited) (continued)     
Short-term debt instruments maturing in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, if
their original term to maturity was 60 days or less, or by amortizing premiums or discounts based on their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if the original term to maturity exceeded 60 days. 
Investments initially valued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates obtained from
pricing services. As a result, the NAV of a Portfolio may be affected by changes in the value of currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. The value of securities traded in markets outside the United States or denominated in currencies other than
the U.S. dollar may be affected significantly on a day that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is closed.  The prices used by
the Portfolio to value investments may differ from the value that would be realized if the investments were sold, and these differences could be material to the Portfolios financial statements. The Portfolios NAV is normally
determined as of the close of regular trading (normally, 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on the NYSE on each day the NYSE is open for business.  (b) Fair Value
Measurements  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e.,
the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:   


 
●
 
 Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical investments that the Portfolio has the ability to
access 


 
●
 
 Level 2  valuations based on other significant observable inputs, which may include, but are not
limited to, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates or other market corroborated inputs 


 
●
 
 Level 3  valuations based on significant unobservable inputs (including the Sub-Advisers or
Valuation Committees own assumptions and securities whose price was determined by using a single brokers quote) 
The valuation techniques used by the Portfolio to measure fair value during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were intended to maximize the
use of observable inputs and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The Portfolios policy is to recognize transfers between
levels at the end of the reporting period. An investment assets or liabilitys level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level input, individually or in aggregate, that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The objective of fair value measurement remains the same even when there is a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability and regardless of the valuation techniques used. Investments categorized as Level 1 or 2
as of period end may have been transferred between Level 1 and 2 since the prior period due to changes in the valuation method utilized in valuing the investments.
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
securities. The following are certain inputs and techniques that the Portfolio generally uses to evaluate how to classify each major category of assets and liabilities for Level 2 and Level 3, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Equity Securities (Common and Preferred Stock)  Equity securities traded in inactive markets are valued using inputs which
include broker-dealer quotes, recently executed transactions adjusted for changes in the benchmark index, or evaluated price quotes received from independent pricing services that take into account the integrity of the market sector and issuer, the
individual characteristics of the security, and information received from broker-dealers and other market sources pertaining to the issuer or security. To the extent that these inputs are observable, the values of equity securities are categorized
as Level 2. To the extent that these inputs are unobservable, the values are categorized as Level 3.  U.S. Treasury Obligations
 U.S. Treasury obligations are valued by independent pricing services based on pricing models that evaluate the mean between the most recently quoted bid and ask price. The models also take into consideration data received from active
market makers and broker-dealers, yield curves, and the spread over comparable U.S. Treasury issues. The spreads change daily in response to market conditions and are generally obtained from the new issue market and broker-dealer sources. To the
extent that these inputs are observable, the values of U.S. Treasury obligations are categorized as Level 2. To the extent that these inputs are unobservable, the values are categorized as Level 3. 
Government Sponsored Enterprise and Mortgage-Backed Securities  Government sponsored enterprise and mortgage-backed securities
are valued by independent pricing services using pricing models based on inputs that include issuer type, coupon, cash flows, mortgage prepayment projection tables and Adjustable Rate Mortgage evaluations that incorporate index data, periodic life
caps and the next coupon reset date. To the extent that these inputs are observable, the values of government sponsored enterprise and mortgage-backed securities are categorized as Level 2. To the extent that these inputs are unobservable, the
values are categorized as Level 3.

(unaudited) (continued)     
Sovereign Debt Obligations  Sovereign debt obligations are valued by independent
pricing services based on discounted cash flow models that incorporate option adjusted spreads along with benchmark curves and credit spreads. In addition, international bond markets are monitored regularly for information pertaining to the issuer
and/or the specific issue. To the extent that these inputs are observable, the values of sovereign debt obligations are categorized as Level 2. To the extent that these inputs are observable, the values are categorized as Level 3.
Corporate Bonds & Notes  Corporate bonds & notes are generally comprised of two main categories; investment grade bonds
and high yield bonds. Investment grade bonds are valued by independent pricing services using various inputs and techniques, which include broker-dealer quotations, live trading levels, recently executed transactions in securities of the issuer or
comparable issuers, and option adjusted spread models that include base curve and spread curve inputs. Adjustments to individual bonds can be applied to recognize trading differences compared to other bonds issues by the same issuer. High yield
bonds are valued by independent pricing services based primarily on broker-dealer quotations from relevant market makers and recently executed transactions in securities of the issuer or comparable issuers. The broker-dealer quotations received are
supported by credit analysis of the issuer that takes into consideration credit quality assessments, daily trading activity, and the activity of the underlying equities, listed bonds and sector-specific trends. To the extent that these inputs are
observable, the values of corporate bonds & notes are categorized as Level 2. To the extent that these inputs are unobservable, the values are categorized as Level 3.
(c) Investment Transactions and Investment Income 
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on investments are determined on an identified cost
basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities purchased are accreted or
amortized, respectively, to interest income. Dividends from underlying funds are recorded as dividend income, while capital gain distributions are recorded as net capital gain distributions received from underlying funds on the Statement of
Operations. Expenses are recorded on an accrual basis and such expenses exclude those of the underlying funds. Expenses of the underlying funds are reflected in the net asset values of those funds.
(d) Federal Income Taxes  The Portfolio
intends to distribute all of its taxable income and to comply with the other requirements of Subchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal
income taxes is required. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes establishes for all entities, including pass through entities such as
the Portfolio, a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of positions taken in filing tax returns (including whether an entity is taxable in a particular jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax disclosures. In
accordance with provisions set forth under U.S. GAAP, the Investment Manager has reviewed the Portfolios tax positions for all open tax years. As of June 30, 2016, the Portfolio has recorded no liability for net unrecognized tax benefits
relating to uncertain income tax positions it has taken. The Portfolios federal income tax returns for the prior three years, as applicable, remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. 
(e) Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders 
The Portfolio declares dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually. The
Portfolio records dividends and distributions on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains is determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which
may differ from U.S. GAAP. These book-tax differences are considered either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on
their federal income tax treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes, they are reported as
dividends and/or distributions to shareholders from return of capital. (f) Foreign Currency Translation 
The Portfolios accounting records are maintained in U.S. dollars as follows: (1) the foreign currency market values of investments and
other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at the end of the period; and (2) purchases and sales, income and expenses are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the respective
dates of such transactions. The resulting net foreign currency gain (loss) is included in the Portfolios Statement of Operations. 
  16

RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio  June 30, 2016
(unaudited) (continued)     
The Portfolio does not generally isolate that portion of the results of operations arising as
a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from the fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices of securities. Accordingly, such foreign currency gain (loss) is included in net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on
investments. However, the Portfolio does isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when determining the gain (loss) upon the sale or maturity of foreign currency denominated debt obligations pursuant to U.S. federal
income tax regulations; such amount is categorized as foreign currency gain (loss) for both financial reporting and income tax reporting purposes.  (g)
Repurchase Agreements  The Portfolio is a party to Master Repurchase Agreements (Master Repo Agreements) with select
counterparties. The Master Repo Agreements maintain provisions for initiation, income payments, events of default, and maintenance of collateral.
The Portfolio enters into transactions, under the Master Repo Agreements, with its custodian bank or with securities brokerage firms whereby
it purchases securities under agreements to resell such securities at an agreed upon price and date (repurchase agreements). The Portfolio, through its custodian, takes possession of securities collateralizing the repurchase agreement.
Such agreements are carried at the contract amount in the financial statements, which is considered to represent fair-value. Collateral pledged (the securities received), which consists primarily of U.S. government obligations and asset-backed
securities, is held by the custodian bank for the benefit of the Portfolio until maturity of the repurchase agreement. Provisions of the repurchase agreements and the procedures adopted by the Portfolio require that the market value of the
collateral, including accrued interest thereon, be sufficient in the event of default by the counterparty. If the counterparty defaults under the Master Repo Agreements, and the value of the collateral declines or if the counterparty enters an
insolvency proceeding, realization of the collateral by the Portfolio may be delayed or limited. The gross value is included in the Portfolios Schedule of Investments. The value of the related collateral exceeded the value of the repurchase
agreements outstanding at June 30, 2016. (h) U.S. Government Agencies or Government-Sponsored Enterprises 
Securities issued by U.S. Government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises may not be guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. The Government
National Mortgage Association (GNMA or Ginnie Mae), a wholly-owned U.S. Government corporation, is authorized to guarantee, with the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, the timely payment of principal and interest
on securities issued by institutions approved by GNMA and backed by pools of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Government-related guarantors not backed by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. Government include the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC or Freddie Mac). Pass-through securities
issued by FNMA are guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by FNMA, but are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. FHLMC guarantees the timely payment of interest and ultimate collection of principal, but
its participation certificates are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.  (i) Exchange-Traded Funds 
The Portfolio may invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which typically are index-based investment companies that hold
substantially all of their assets in securities representing their specific index, but may also be actively-managed investment companies. Shares of ETFs trade throughout the day on an exchange and represent an investment in a portfolio of securities
and other assets. As a shareholder of another investment company, the Portfolio would bear their pro rata portion of the other investment companys expenses, including advisory fees, in addition to the expenses the Portfolio bear directly
in connection with its own operations.  (j) Organizational and Offering Costs
Organizational costs are expensed at the inception of the Portfolio. Offering costs are amortized over a twelve-month period from the
commencement of the Portfolio.  2. Principal Risks 
In the normal course of business, the Portfolio trades financial instruments and enters into financial transactions where risk of potential
loss exists due to, among other things, changes in the market (market risk) or failure of the other party to a transaction to perform (counterparty risk). The Portfolio is also exposed to other risks such as, but not limited to, interest rate,
foreign currency and credit risks. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed income securities valuations will change because of
changes in interest rates. During periods of rising nominal interest rates, the values of fixed income instruments are generally expected to decline. Conversely, during periods of declining nominal interest rates, the values of fixed income
instruments are generally expected to rise. A nominal interest rate can be described as the sum of a real interest rate and an expected inflation rate. Fixed income securities with longer durations tend to
be
  17 


Table of Contents
Notes to Financial Statements 
RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio  June 30, 2016
(unaudited) (continued)     

more sensitive to changes in interest rates, usually making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations. Duration is used primarily as a measure of the sensitivity of a fixed
income securitys market price to interest rate (i.e. yield) movements. Interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable, and the Portfolio may lose money as a result of movements in interest rates. The Portfolio may not be able to
hedge against changes in interest rates or may choose not to do so for cost or other reasons. In addition, any hedges may not work as intended. 
The Portfolio is exposed to credit risk, which is the risk of losing money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security is unable or
unwilling, or is perceived (whether by market participants, rating agencies, pricing services or otherwise) as unable or unwilling, to make timely principal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Securities are subject
to varying degrees of credit risk, which are often reflected in credit ratings.  To the extent the Portfolio directly invests in foreign
currencies or in securities that trade in, and receives revenues in, foreign currencies, or in derivatives that provide exposure to foreign currencies, it will be subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S.
dollar, or, in the case of hedging positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline in value relative to the currency being hedged. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons,
including economic growth, inflation, changes in interest rates, intervention (or the failure to intervene) by U.S. or foreign governments, central banks or supranational entities such as the International Monetary Fund, or the imposition of
currency controls or other political developments in the United States or abroad. As a result, the Portfolios investments in foreign currency-denominated securities may reduce the returns of the Portfolio. The local emerging market
currencies in which the Portfolio may be invested may experience substantially greater volatility against the U.S. dollar than the major convertible currencies in developed countries. 
The Portfolio is subject to elements of risk not typically associated with investments in the U.S., due to concentrated investments in foreign
issuers located in a specific country or region. Such concentrations will subject the Portfolio to additional risks resulting from future political or economic conditions in such country or region and the possible imposition of adverse governmental
laws or currency exchange restrictions affecting such country or region, which could cause the securities and their markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies.
The market values of securities may decline due to general market conditions (market risk) which are not specifically related to a particular
company, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment. They may also decline due to factors that affect a particular
industry or industries, such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry. Equity securities and equity-related investments generally have greater market price volatility than fixed income
securities, although under certain market conditions fixed income securities may have comparable or greater price volatility. Credit ratings downgrades may also negatively affect securities held by the Portfolio. Even when markets perform well,
there is no assurance that the investments held by the Portfolio will increase in value along with the broader market. In addition, market risk includes the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt the economy on a national or global level. 
The Portfolio is exposed to counterparty risk, or the risk that an institution or other entity with which the Portfolio has unsettled or open
transactions will default. The potential loss to the Portfolio could exceed the value of the financial assets recorded in the Portfolios financial statements. Financial assets, which potentially expose the Portfolio to counterparty risk,
consist principally of cash due from counterparties and investments. The Sub-Adviser seeks to minimize the Portfolios counterparty risk by performing reviews of each counterparty and by minimizing concentration of counterparty risk by
undertaking transactions with multiple customers and counterparties on recognized and reputable exchanges. Delivery of securities sold is only made once the Portfolio has received a payment. Payment is made on a purchase once the securities have
been delivered by the counterparty. The trade will fail if either party fails to meet its obligation. The counterparty risk associated
with certain contracts may be reduced by master netting arrangements to the extent that if an event of default occurs, all amounts with the counterparty are terminated and settled on a net basis. The Portfolios overall exposure to
counterparty risk with respect to transactions subject to master netting arrangements can change substantially within a short period, as it is affected by each transaction subject to the arrangement.
3. Underlying Funds and Other Acquired Funds Risk 
The Portfolio may, at any time, invest in affiliated and unaffiliated funds (which may include certain affiliated mutual funds and ETFs
sponsored by AAM or its subsidiaries (the Underlying Funds) and ETFs, mutual funds and pooled investment vehicles other than the Underlying Funds (Other Acquired Funds)). Accordingly, the investment performance of the
Portfolio depends upon a favorable allocation among the Underlying Funds and Other Acquired Funds as well as the ability of the Underlying Funds and Other Acquired Funds to achieve their objectives. There can be no assurance that the investment
objective of any Underlying Fund or Other Acquired Fund will be achieved. The risks associated with investing in each Fund are closely related to the risks associated with the securities and other investments held by the Underlying Funds and
Other Acquired Funds.

Investing in the Underlying Funds and Other Acquired Funds involves certain additional
expenses and tax results that would not be present in a direct investment in the Underlying Funds or Other Acquired Funds. The Portfolios NAV will fluctuate in response to changes in the net asset values of the Underlying Funds and Other
Acquired Funds in which it invests. The extent to which the investment performance and risks associated with Portfolio correlate to those of a particular Underlying Fund or Other Acquired Fund will depend upon the extent to which Portfolios
assets are allocated from time to time for investment in the Underlying Fund or Other Acquired Fund, which will vary. The Portfolio may invest in other investment companies during periods when it has large amounts of uninvested cash, during periods
when there is a shortage of attractive securities available in the market, or when a Sub-Adviser believes share prices of other investment companies offer attractive values. To the extent that a Portfolio invests a significant portion of its assets
in an Underlying Fund, it will be particularly sensitive to the risks associated with that Underlying Fund.  4. Financial Derivative Instruments
 Disclosure about derivatives and hedging activities requires qualitative disclosure regarding objectives and strategies for using
derivatives, quantitative disclosure about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivatives, and disclosure about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The disclosure requirements distinguish between derivatives,
which are accounted for as hedges, and those that do not qualify for such accounting. Although the Portfolio at times use derivatives for hedging purposes, the Portfolio reflect derivatives at fair value and recognize changes in fair
value through the Portfolios Statement of Operations, and such derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
Futures Contracts. The Portfolio uses futures contracts to manage their exposure to the securities markets or the movements in interest
rates and currency values. A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a financial instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a contract, the Portfolio is required to pledge to the broker an amount
of cash or securities equal to the minimum initial margin requirements of the exchange. Pursuant to the contracts, the Portfolio agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash or securities equal to the daily fluctuation
in the value of the contracts. Such receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the Portfolio as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When the contracts are closed, the Portfolio records a realized gain or
loss equal to the difference between the value of the contracts at the time they were opened and the value at the time they were closed. Any unrealized appreciation or depreciation recorded is simultaneously reversed. The use of futures transactions
involves various risks, including the risk of an imperfect correlation in the movements in the price of futures contracts, interest rates and underlying hedging assets, and possible inability or unwillingness of counterparties to meet the terms of
their contracts.  5. Investment Manager/Sub-Adviser/Distributor Fees & Deferred Compensation 
The Trust, on behalf of the Portfolio, has an Investment Management Agreement (the Agreement) with the Investment Manager. Subject
to the supervision of the Portfolios Board, the Investment Manager is responsible for managing, either directly or through others selected by it, the Portfolios investment activities, business affairs and administrative matters. Pursuant
to the Agreement, the Investment Manager receives an annual fee, payable monthly (net of any reimbursements or recoupment), at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Portfolios average daily net assets. 
The Investment Manager has retained the Sub-Adviser to manage the Portfolios investments. Subject to the supervision of the Investment
Manager, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for making all of the Portfolios investment decisions. The Investment Manager, not the Portfolio, pays a portion of the fees it receives as Investment Manager to the Sub-Adviser in return for its
services.  Allianz Global Investors Distributors LLC (the Distributor), an affiliate of AAM, the Investment Manager and the
Sub-Adviser, serves as the distributor of the Trusts shares. The Trust has adopted a Distribution and Servicing Plan (the Plan). The Plan permits the Trust, or the Distributor acting as agent of the Trust, to make payments to
participating insurance companies, plan sponsors and other financial institutions as compensation for services rendered or expenses borne in connection with certain enumerated services, which include the provision of personal services to segregated
asset account shareholders and maintenance of shareholder accounts (servicing fees). The Plan permits the share class currently offered by the Portfolio to pay servicing fees at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the Portfolios
average daily net assets. Payments are accrued daily and paid monthly.  The Trustees do not currently receive any pension or retirement
benefits from the Trust or the fund complex. The Trust has adopted a deferred compensation plan for the Trustees that went into place on January 1, 2015 and permits the Trustees to defer their receipt of compensation from the Trust, at their
election, in accordance with the terms of the plan. Under the plan, each Trustee may elect not to receive all or a portion of his or her fees from the Trust on a current basis but to receive in a subsequent period chosen by the Trustee an amount
equal to the value of such compensation if such compensation had been invested in a Portfolio or Portfolios or in one or

more series of Allianz Funds MultiStrategy Trust or Allianz Funds, selected by the
Trustees from and after the normal payment dates for such compensation. The deferred compensation program is structured such that the Trust remains in substantially the same financial position whether the Trustee fees are paid when earned or
deferred.  6. Expense Limitation  The
Trust and the Investment Manager have entered into an Expense Limitation Agreement whereby the Investment Manager has agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse any acquired fund fees and expenses to the Portfolio through April 30, 2017, to the extent
that total annual Portfolio operating expenses, including payment of organizational expenses but excluding interest, tax and extraordinary expenses, and certain credits and other expenses, exceed 1.20% of the Portfolios average net assets. The
Investment Manager, as per the Expense Limitation Agreement, may recoup waived and/or reimbursed amounts for a period of up to three years, provided total expenses, including such recoupment, do not exceed the annual expense limit in effect at the
time of such waiver/reimbursement. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Investment Manager reimbursed $53,791 to the Portfolio as disclosed on the Statement of Operations. The Investment Manager may recoup $140,713 of expenses
waived/reimbursed in fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  7. Investments in Securities 
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, purchases and sales of investments, other than short-term securities, were:

 8. Income Tax Information 
At June 30, 2016, the cost basis of portfolio securities for federal income tax purposes was $21,366,910. Gross unrealized appreciation was
$271,039, gross unrealized depreciation was $24,067 and net unrealized appreciation was $246,972. The difference between book and tax basis was attributable to wash sale loss deferrals and the differing treatment of bond premium amortization.
9. Affiliated Transactions 
At June 30, 2016, two affiliated insurance-dedicated fund-of-fund vehicles sponsored by Allianz Life owned 100% of the Portfolio. Portfolio
share subscription and redemption activity by the fund-of-fund vehicles with respect to Portfolio shares could have a material impact on the Portfolio.

 10. Borrowings 
On July 31, 2015, the Trust entered into a new credit agreement (the Northern Trust Agreement), among the Trust, AllianzGI
Institutional Multi-Series Trust, Allianz Funds and Allianz Funds Multi-Strategy Trust, as borrowers (collectively, the AllianzGI Borrowers and certain series thereof, each an AllianzGI Borrower Fund), and Northern Trust
Company, as lender, for a committed line of credit. The Northern Trust Agreement permits the AllianzGI Borrowers to borrow up to $200 million in aggregate, subject to (i) a requirement that each AllianzGI Borrower Funds asset coverage with
respect to senior securities representing indebtedness be 300% or higher, and (ii) certain other limitations and conditions. Each AllianzGI Borrower Fund is obligated to pay interest on any amounts borrowed under the facility at the greater
of (i) the federal funds overnight rate plus 1.00% or (ii) 1.50%, subject to upward adjustment when any past-due payments are outstanding. The AllianzGI Borrowers also pay a usage fee at an annualized rate of 0.15% on undrawn amounts,
allocated pro rata among the AllianzGI Borrower Funds on the basis of net assets. Amounts borrowed may be repaid and reborrowed on a revolving basis, subject to availability and compliance with the terms of the Northern Trust Agreement, during the
term of the facility. The Portfolio did not

utilize the line of credit during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Northern Trust
Agreement had an original maturity date of July 29, 2016, which was extended by 90 days to expire on October 27, 2016, unless further extended, or renewed with revised terms.
11. Subsequent Events  In preparing these financial
statements, the Portfolios management has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the date the financial statements were issued.

Matters Relating to the Trustees Consideration of the Investment Management and
Portfolio Management Agreements (unaudited)  RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio 
  The Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), requires that both the full Board of Trustees (the Board or the Trustees) and a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust (the Independent
Trustees), voting separately, annually approve the continuation of (i) the Trusts Investment Management Agreement (the Investment Management Agreement) on behalf of RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio (the
Portfolio) with Allianz Global Investors Fund Management LLC (the Investment Manager) and (ii) the Sub-Advisory Agreement between the Investment Manager and Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC (the
Sub-Adviser) with respect to the Portfolio. The Investment Management Agreement and the Sub-Advisory Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the Agreements. 
The Trusts Contracts Committee, which is comprised of all of the Independent Trustees, met on May 24, 2016 and June 8, 2016 with
independent counsel to discuss the materials provided by the Investment Manager in response to the Independent Trustees written request for information regarding the annual renewal. Representatives from fund management attended portions of
those meetings to review, among other topics, the comparative fee and expense information and comparative performance information prepared and provided by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge) for the Portfolio using its
Broadridge peer universe for performance and expense comparisons.  At an in-person meeting held on June 8, 2016, the Board and the
Independent Trustees unanimously approved the continuation of the Agreements for an additional one-year period from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017.
The material factors and conclusions that formed the basis of these approvals for the Portfolio are discussed below. 
The Independent Trustees were assisted in their evaluation of the Agreements and the factors that they deemed to be material, including, but
not limited to, those factors described below, by independent legal counsel, from whom they received separate legal advice and with whom they met separately from fund management during their contract review meeting. 
In connection with their deliberations regarding the approval of the Agreements, the Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, considered
such information and factors as they believed, in light of the legal advice furnished to them and their own business judgment, to be relevant. As described below, the Trustees considered the nature, quality and extent of the various investment
management, administrative and other services performed by the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser under the Agreements.  In connection
with their contract review meetings, the Trustees received and relied upon materials provided by the Investment Manager including, among other items: (i) information provided by Broadridge, an independent third party, for the Portfolio on the
investment performance of a group of funds with investment classifications and/or objectives comparable to those of the Portfolio identified by Broadridge (the Broadridge performance universe), the performance of applicable benchmark
indices and the total return investment performance (based on net assets) of the Portfolio for various time periods; (ii) information on the Portfolios management fees and other expenses and information compiled by Broadridge, as applicable,
on the management fees and other expenses of comparable funds identified by Broadridge; (iii) information regarding the investment performance and fees for other funds and accounts managed by the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser, including
institutional and separate accounts, with a similar investment objective and policies to those of the Portfolio; (iv) an estimate of profitability to the Investment Manager from its relationship with the Portfolio for the twelve months ended March
31, 2016; (v) descriptions of various functions performed by the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser for the Portfolio, such as portfolio management, compliance monitoring and portfolio trading practices; (vi) information regarding the overall
organization of the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser, including, without limitation, information regarding senior management, portfolio managers and other personnel providing or proposed to provide investment management, administrative and
other services and corporate ownership and business operations unrelated to the Portfolio; and (vii) a fact card for the Portfolio including, among other information, performance comparisons between the Portfolio and its Broadridge peer group, total
expense ratio and management fee comparisons between the Portfolio and its Broadridge peer group hard return and trends in profitability to the Investment Manager of its advisory relationship with the Portfolio. The Trustees conclusions
as to the approval of the Agreements were based on a comprehensive consideration of all information provided to the Trustees and were not the result of any single factor. Some of the factors that figured particularly in the Trustees
deliberations are described below, although individual Trustees may have evaluated the information presented differently from one another, giving different weights to various factors. The Trustees recognized that the fee arrangements for the
Portfolio are the result of prior review and discussion between the Trustees and the Investment Manager, that certain aspects of such arrangements may receive greater scrutiny in some years than in others, and that the Trustees conclusions may
be based, in part, on their consideration of the same arrangements during the course of the year and in prior years. The Trustees also took into account that the Investment Manager had proposed the continuation of expense caps for the Portfolio. The
Trustees also considered the risk profile of the Portfolio.

Performance Information 
Performance results for the Portfolio reviewed by the Trustees are discussed below. The comparative performance information was prepared and
provided by Broadridge and was not independently verified by the Trustees. Due to the passage of time, these performance results may differ from the performance results for more recent periods, including those shown elsewhere in this report. The
Trustees reviewed, among other information, comparative information showing performance for Portfolio shares against its Broadridge performance universe for the period since inception and ending March 31, 2016. In reviewing the comparative
performance information for the Portfolio, the Trustees took into account that the Portfolio had been in existence for less than a year and had a relatively short performance history. For the Portfolio, performance was below median (in the
fifth quintile) for the period since inception. In addition, the Trustees considered matters bearing on the Portfolio and its advisory
arrangements at their meetings throughout the year, including a review of performance data at each regular meeting.  As part of their
review, the Trustees examined the ability of the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser to provide high-quality investment management and other services to the Portfolio. Among other information, the Trustees considered the investment philosophy and
research and decision making processes of the Sub-Adviser; the experience of key advisory personnel of the Sub-Adviser responsible for portfolio management of the Portfolio; the ability of the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser to attract and
retain capable personnel; and the capability of the senior management and staff of the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser. In addition, the Trustees reviewed the quality of the Investment Managers and the Sub-Advisers services with
respect to regulatory compliance and ability to comply with the investment and compliance policies and procedures of the Portfolio; the nature, extent and quality of certain administrative services the Investment Manager is responsible for providing
to the Portfolio; and conditions that might affect the ability of the Investment Manager or the Sub-Adviser to provide high quality services to the Portfolio in the future under the Agreements, including each organizations respective financial
condition and operational stability. Based on the foregoing, the Trustees concluded that the Sub-Advisers investment process, research capabilities and philosophy were well-suited to the Portfolio given its respective investment objectives and
policies, and that the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser would be able to continue to meet and/or meet any reasonably foreseeable obligations under each Agreement. 
Fee and Expense Information  In
assessing the reasonableness of the Portfolios fees under the Agreements, the Trustees considered, among other information, the Portfolios management fee and total expense ratio as a percentage of average daily net assets and the
management fees and total expense ratios of a peer group of funds based on information provided by Broadridge. The Trustees also noted the expense limitation agreement observed by the Investment Manager for the Portfolio that caps the total annual
expenses of the Portfolio. The Trustees also considered, among other items: (i) the level of the Portfolios sub-advisory fees; (ii) the allocation of the management fee between the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser, and the services
provided by the Investment Manager, on the one hand, and the Sub-Adviser, on the other hand; and (iii) that the Investment Manager (and not the Portfolio) pays the Sub-Advisory fee. 
In comparing the Portfolio to its Broadridge peers, with respect to expenses, the Trustees noted that the Portfolio was not charged a separate
administration fee, recognizing that their management fee includes a component for administrative services, while many peer funds in the Broadridge category have separate advisory and administration agreements with separate fees. 
The Trustees also considered information showing the advisory fees charged by the Investment Manager and Sub-Adviser to other funds and
accounts, including institutional and separate accounts, with a similar investment objective and policies to those of the Portfolio. In comparing these fees, the Trustees considered information provided by the Investment Manager as to the generally
broader and more extensive services provided to the Portfolio in comparison to institutional or separate accounts, the higher demands placed on the Investment Managers investment personnel and trading infrastructure as a result of the daily
cash in-flows and out-flows of the Portfolio, the greater entrepreneurial risk in managing mutual funds and the impact on the Investment Manager and expenses associated with the more extensive regulatory regime to which the Portfolio is subject in
comparison to institutional or separate accounts.  The Trustees reviewed information provided by Broadridge comparing the Portfolios
management fee and ratios of total expenses to net assets (total expense ratios) to those of a group of comparable funds for the most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The Trustees noted that the Broadridge data takes into
account any fee reductions or expense limitations that were in effect during the 
  24

Agreements (unaudited) (continued)  RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT Portfolio 
   
Portfolios last fiscal year. The fee and expense results discussed below were prepared
and provided by Broadridge, as applicable, and were not independently verified by the Trustees. The Portfolios management fees and total expense ratios (taking fee waivers and/or expense limitations into account) were below the median of the
Broadridge-selected group of comparable funds. The Trustees considered the estimated profitability to the Investment Manager of its
relationship with the Portfolio and determined that such profitability did not appear to be excessive. The Trustees considered the extent to which the Investment Manager and Sub-Adviser may realize economies of scale or other efficiencies in
managing and supporting the Portfolio. The Trustees took into account that, as an open-end investment company, the Portfolio intends to raise additional assets, so as the assets of the Portfolio grow over time, certain economies of scale and other
efficiencies may be realized through spreading certain fixed costs across a larger asset base or across a variety of products and services, while also taking into account the expense limitation arrangements observed by the Investment Manager for the
Portfolio. Additionally, the Trustees considered so-called fall-out benefits to the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates, such as reputational value derived from serving as Investment Manager and Sub-Adviser to the
Portfolio.  After reviewing these and other factors described herein, the Trustees concluded, within the context of their overall
conclusions regarding the Agreements, that they were satisfied with the Investment Managers and Sub-Advisers responses and efforts relating to the investment performance of the Portfolio, including efforts to improve performance. The
Trustees also concluded that the fees payable under each Agreement represent reasonable compensation in light of the nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Investment Manager or Sub-Adviser, as the case may be, and should be
continued. Based on their evaluation of factors that they deemed to be material, including, but not limited to, those factors described above, the Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, unanimously concluded that the continuation of the
Agreements with respect to the Portfolio were in the interests of the Portfolio and its shareholders, and determined to approve such continuation.

Vitamin C: A Response to Jane Brody 
VITAMIN C & E MAY PROTECT THE AGING BRAIN
Taking vitamin C and vitamin E supplements may help protect memory and mental decline as you age. A new study has found that elderly men who took vitamin E and C supplements at least once a week over a number of years were protected from dementia and actually showed improvements in cognitive function -- a catch-all term including memory, creativity and mental acuity. Although a protective effect was seen for two different types of dementia in men who took both vitamins, the supplements did not appear to prevent dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The authors note that men who took both vitamin E and C supplements together for many years showed a substantially greater improvement, suggesting that long-term use is required to improve cognitive function in late life. The researchers believe that vitamin C and E may protect from brain damage because they are antioxidants and can mop up brain-damaging free radical particles.
