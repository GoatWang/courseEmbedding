Stephen F. Fisher Toronto Knife Maker, Handmade knife toronto | Helve Haft & Handle 



INVENTORYABOUTCONTACTCAREHELVE HAFT & HANDLELIMITED EDITION / HANDMADE KNIVES








“These knives are all unique, and because everything is done by hand, no two are exactly alike. I see this as an exercise in transforming discarded materials, or perhaps materials with un-tapped potentials into better tools.” - Stephen FisherFisher at Sugimoto Knife Shop in  Tsukiji Fish Market, Tokyo,  Japan. STEPHEN F. FISHER.Coming from a family of those who worked with their hands from a Tin-Smith, to Aircraft Mechanic, to classical Musician, Farmer, Engineer and Bricklayer; being creative, curious, and building things from raw materials is in Fisher’s blood. Largely self taught, Fisher’s endeavor into knifemaking started in 2011 and has steadily increased in intensity with the establishment of Helve Haft & Handle in 2012, and the commencement of limited commercial, and retail sales of knives and other select products across Canada and the US. Fisher’s knowledge of knifemaking continues to expand with every new knife he makes.Taking inspiration from local blacksmiths, builders, chefs and other artisans (many of whom are personal friends), Fisher decided to take his interest in making objects to the next level when he put his career as a visual artist on the back burner for a while to see what he could do. He quickly realized that knifemaking would be a life-changing passion. Fisher wanted to combine his extensive camping, hiking, and traveling experiences, with his love for cooking and so Helve Haft & Handle serves as an outlet for these interests, and as a name to create quality, functional artworks under.Fisher was born in Wolfville, Nova Scotia in 1979. He attended NSCAD University from 2000 to 2004. In 2008 Fisher relocated to Ontario to attend and complete the Masters of Fine Arts degree at The University of Guelph. Fisher now lives and works in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada.ABOUT HH&HHelve Haft & Handle’s ideology is rooted in the idea that everyone is capable of making the tools they need. At HH&H we set aside time for researching and sourcing the right metals for long lasting blades, and harvesting hardwoods from local trees and discarded exotic wood scraps from local sources. At Helve Haft & Handle we adopt the idea of making something with what is at hand, which continues to establish and maintain an environment of experimentation and innovation in everything we produce.Our feelings about handmade knives can hug a line between the natural and supernatural, we can’t help but feel that being a maker of  humanity’s oldest and first tool has some special mojo around it, not only in the mystical nostalgia of the blacksmiths and bladesmiths of legend, but also perhaps that the knife is as close to an embodyment of the human story as you can get. It is a tool that is at once extremely useful, yet in the wrong hands, extremely dangerous. We can change our environment with it by carving, dividing, sharpening, and hunting. In ancient times it meant the difference between survival and death, but today the knife symbolizes a choice to do something for one’s self, the choice to make or change something with your own hands, rather than simply consume. Its about preparing your food, not just eating it, and about chopping that kindling for a fire. We believe this is of utmost importance in todays world of mass manufacturing and the removal of our connection to the natural world.We believe that people can form lasting relationships with well-made tools and objects they use in their daily lives. We promote regular maintenance and understanding of how your knife works, rather than continuing to buy throw-away knives and tools you can find anywhere.All metals are shaped, carved, honed, and gathered 100% by Fisher himself.All hardwoods are either harvested by us, or obtained as scraps from local furniture makers, and other woodworkers.Burning a hidden tang Deba into its handle in the traditional method.Helve Haft & Handle is a small Knifemaking studio based in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, specializing in custom handmade Kitchen knives and other woodland products. At HH&H our main interest has been to embody the idea of self sufficiency and making tools from what one has at hand. To us, that has meant collecting used metals, hardwoods, and other items to be re-purposed and given new life as functional tools, and maybe something thats amazing to look at as well!All of the knives and other items produced by HH&H are made with re-used, reclaimed and found hardwoods, repurposed metals, and leather scraps we find locally. Everything we make is handmade right here in Downtown Toronto, Ontario.To see what we have to offer, use the navigation menue above to check out our Inventory, to contact us, and for further information on our products! Also, be sure to follow us on all our social media outlets, links found above.MADE IN CANADAMANUFACTURED BY HANDIN TORONTO, ONTARIOALL OUR WOOD IS HANDHARVESTED IN ONTARIOFROM DOWNED TREES, ORRECLAIMED FROM OTHERLOCAL INDUSTRYALL OUR STEEL IS HIGHQUALITY, LOCALLY SOURCED,AND RECLAIMED FROMLOCAL INDUSTRY.  HH&H is pleased to be able to share this documentary vignette created by the very tallented Vancouver and Toronto based filmmaker Sean Stiller. The short is the result of Sean spending some time filming the process behind HH&H's knifemaking, and discussing some of the philosphies behind what we're trying to imbue our knives and other works with.
