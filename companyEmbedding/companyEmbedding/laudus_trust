Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, or if available, the summary prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Please read it carefully before investing.



Not FDIC-Insured · No Bank Guarantee · May Lose Value

Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), the investment advisor for Schwab's proprietary funds, and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (Schwab, Member SIPC), the distributor for Schwab Funds, are separate but affiliated companies and subsidiaries of The Charles Schwab Corporation.

Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor's shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV). 

The values of target date funds will fluctuate up to and after the target dates. There is no guarantee the funds will provide adequate income at or through retirement.

The target date funds are built for investors who expect to start gradual withdrawals of fund assets on the target date, to begin covering expenses in retirement. The principal value of the funds is not guaranteed at any time, and will continue to fluctuate up to and after the target date.

Target date funds asset allocations are subject to change over time in accordance with each fund's prospectus. 

Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. All of these factors can subject the funds to increased loss of principal. 

The Laudus Group® of Funds includes the Laudus Mondrian Funds and Laudus U.S. Large Cap Growth Fund, which are part of the Laudus Trust and distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc., and the Laudus MarketMasters Funds®, which are part of the Schwab Capital Trust and distributed by Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ALPS Distributors, Inc. and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. are unaffiliated entities. 

All Funds with the exception of Schwab Variable Share Price Money Fund: You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. All Schwab Money Funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, but cannot guarantee they will do so. Effective October 14, 2016, all funds with the exception of Schwab Government Money Fund, Schwab Treasury Money Fund, Schwab Treasury Obligations Fund, Schwab Government Money Market Portfolio, and Schwab Retirement Government Money Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The money market fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.

Schwab Variable Share Price Money Fund: You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. Effective October 14, 2016, the fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.

Schwab reserves the right to exempt certain funds from this fee, including Schwab Funds®, which may charge a separate redemption fee, and funds that accommodate short-term trading. For each of these trade orders placed through a broker, a $25 service charge applies. Funds are also subject to management fees and expenses. Trades in no-load mutual funds available through Mutual Funds OneSource service (including SchwabFunds) as well as certain other funds, are available without transaction fees when placed through schwab.com or our automated phone channels. For each of these trade orders placed through a broker, a $25 service charge applies. Schwab reserves the right to change the funds we make available without transaction fees and to reinstate fees on any funds. Funds are also subject to management fees and expenses. Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., member of SIPC, receives remuneration from fund companies for record keeping, shareholder services, and other administrative services for shares purchased through its Mutual Fund OneSource service. Schwab also may receive remuneration from transaction fee fund companies for certain administrative services.The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Except as noted below, all data provided by Morningstar, Inc.

Schwab Bank Collective Trust Funds
1. The Charles Schwab Collective Trust Funds ("Funds") are maintained by Charles Schwab Bank ("Schwab Bank"), trustee of the funds, and are available for investment only by eligible retirement plans and entities. The Funds are not mutual funds and are exempt from registration and regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), and their units are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or applicable securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction. Unit holders of the Funds are not entitled to the protections of the 1940 Act. The decision to invest in the Funds should be carefully considered. The Funds' unit values will fluctuate and may be worth more or less when redeemed, so unit holders may lose money. The Funds are not sold by prospectus and are not available for investment by the public; Fund prices are not quoted in newspapers.

ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).

Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. All of these factors can subject the funds to increased loss of principal.

Investment income may be subject to certain state and local taxes and, depending on your tax status, the federal alternative minimum tax. Capital gains are not exempt from federal income tax.

 The fund normally invests a substantial amount of its assets in equity securities of companies outside the United States. The adviser expects to invest in companies across all market capitalization ranges. It typically focuses on developed markets, but may invest in companies from emerging markets as well. The fund may use derivatives, primarily futures contracts, to seek returns on the fund's otherwise uninvested cash assets. The investment managers may use futures contracts as a substitute for investing directly in an underlying asset or to increase returns.Details52 Week Range$20.46 - $25.30YTD ReturnYTD Return is adjusted for possible sales charges, and assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.21.41%as of 07/24/2017Gross Expense Ratio1.54%Net Expense Ratio1.25%Tax-Equivalent Yield--30-Day SEC Yield--Distribution Yield TTMDistribution Yield is the Trailing 12-Month End Yield - Morningstar computes this figure by summing the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the sum by the last month's ending Net Asset Value (NAV), plus capital gains distributed over the same time period.

Some of the data may not be applicable to your plan's core retirement plan investments.Schwab's Financial and Other Relationships with Mutual FundsInvestors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 1-800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.Past performance does not guarantee future performance. Investment value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost. If an expense waiver was in place during the period, the net expense ratio was used to calculate fund performance.Schwab's short-term redemption fee of $49.95 will be charged on redemption of funds purchased through Schwab's Mutual Fund OneSource® service (and certain other funds with no transaction fee) and held for 90 days or less. Schwab reserves the right to exempt certain funds from this fee, including Schwab Funds®, which may charge a separate redemption fee, and funds that accommodate short-term trading. For each of these trade orders placed through a broker, a $25 service charge applies. Funds are also subject to management fees and expenses. Trades in no-load mutual funds available through Mutual Funds OneSource service (including SchwabFunds) as well as certain other funds, are available without transaction fees when placed through schwab.com or our automated phone channels. For each of these trade orders placed through a broker, a $25 service charge applies. Schwab reserves the right to change the funds we make available without transaction fees and to reinstate fees on any funds. Funds are also subject to management fees and expenses. Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., member of SIPC, receives remuneration from fund companies for record keeping, shareholder services, and other administrative services for shares purchased through its Mutual Fund OneSource service. Schwab also may receive remuneration from transaction fee fund companies for certain administrative services.The Laudus Group® of Funds includes the Laudus Mondrian Funds and Laudus U.S. Large Cap Growth Fund, which are part of the Laudus Trust and distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc.; and the Laudus MarketMasters Funds®, which are part of the Schwab Capitial Trust and distributed by Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ALPS Distributors, Inc. and Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. are unaffiliated entities.The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Except as noted below, all data provided by Morningstar, Inc.
