LEAWOOD, Kan., Sept. 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Palmer Square Capital Management, along with Montage Investments and Atlantic Asset Management, today announced a partnership with Geneva Arbitrage Fund L.P.  Geneva invests in equity opportunities of companies that are engaged primarily in corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions while simultaneously seeking to reduce portfolio risk through hedging.  In addition to securing investment capital, the relationship provides Geneva with access to the distribution channels of Montage and Atlantic.
"We are thrilled to offer our investors access to the experience and innovation of Geneva," said Christopher D. Long, president of Palmer Square. "Geneva strictly adheres to an investment process that has a proven track record since its inception in 2004. We believe that Geneva's merger arbitrage strategy is the right one for our investors due to Geneva's in-depth risk management, experience and focus on capital preservation."
The agreement to partner with Geneva was done in affiliation with Montage Investments – a unique group of asset managers offering multiple investment solutions, including mutual funds, closed-end funds, separately managed accounts and alternative investments to financial intermediaries. The agreement was further enabled by Atlantic Asset Management, which has decades of experience identifying and partnering with talented emerging managers. 
According to Lance Eckel, founding partner of Geneva, "We are looking forward to expanding our strategy through our relationship with Palmer Square. At Geneva, we share a common focus with Palmer Square in that we strive to provide an innovative alternative strategy that can generate consistent returns with a constant emphasis on minimizing downside risk. It is because of this shared focus that we are confident we will be able to achieve great success with Palmer Square as a partner."
Gary Henson, president and chief investment officer of Montage commented, "It is exciting to partner with a firm such as Geneva that has such a high level of experience and focus. Geneva knows merger arbitrage inside and out.  By offering access to that knowledge and experience, we further Montage's mission of providing financial advisors unique alternative investment solutions that go beyond the traditional style boxes."
