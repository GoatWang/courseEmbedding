Streamline®                                The Bloodline System Revolutionized.                            
Airless. Easier. Safer. Aimed at the in-center hemodialysis market, Streamline is designed to eliminate blood-air interface, reduce setup time, and enable higher blood flow rates while maintaining or improving Kt/V. Streamline is used in over 20 million dialysis procedures annually and is available for use with most conventional hemodialysis machines.

Better Productivity. Better Care. Better Patients. The Nx2me Connected Health application is a digital flowsheet that comes preloaded on an iPad® connecting clinicians and staff to their patients on home hemodialysis. It takes away the headache and hassle of old fashioned paper flowsheets that need to be filled out by patients and entered by center staff. With Nx2me, patients simply input their medical information and hemodialysis treatment details under the relevant prompts and press enter.

System One is used by 15 of the top 20 renal care hospitals in the United States. System One’s simple, intuitive controls allow for individualized therapy, eliminates scales with its unique fluid balancing system, requires no waste bags as effluent flows to an open drain line, requires no special electrical or plumbing, and its disposable cartridge is designed to eliminate blood-air interface.

These programs conveniently sync with our health insurance plans and offer cutting edge online and mobile access to manage your savings and expenses.

System One™                                Simple. Flexible. Portable.                            
At NxStage, we specialize in home hemodialysis treatments, which allow patients to perform their treatment in the comfort of their home. NxStage System One was designed with patients in mind to provide simplicity, flexibility, and portability without compromising safety. System One was designed to overcome the challenges posed by traditional equipment and is the first truly portable hemodialysis system for home and clinic use. Flexible therapy options allow patients to perform therapy during the day or while they sleep. The system is easy to use, versatile, and gives patients the freedom to travel.
What is System One?














Nx2me Connected Health®                                The Easy Digital Flowsheet.                            
Better Productivity. Better Care. Better Patients. The Nx2me Connected Health application is a digital flowsheet that comes preloaded on an iPad® connecting clinicians and staff to their patients on home hemodialysis. It takes away the headache and hassle of old fashioned paper flowsheets that need to be filled out by patients and entered by center staff. With Nx2me, patients simply input their medical information and hemodialysis treatment details under the relevant prompts and press enter.

System One™ S with NxView                                Simplicity In a Complex World.                            
System One is used by 15 of the top 20 renal care hospitals in the United States. System One’s simple, intuitive controls allow for individualized therapy, eliminates scales with its unique fluid balancing system, requires no waste bags as effluent flows to an open drain line, requires no special electrical or plumbing, and its disposable cartridge is designed to eliminate blood-air interface.

When People Feel Better They Live Better






Watch how more frequent home hemodialysis with the NxStage System One allowed Leo to get back to the life he missed!
Home Hemodialysis is a different way of doing hemodialysis.
Instead of going to a dialysis center, home hemodialysis with the NxStage System One is performed in the comfort of your home.
The System One offers flexible therapy options including performing your treatments during the day or at night while you sleep allowing you to spend your day your way!
Despite the health benefits that more frequent home hemodialysis may provide to those with chronic kidney disease, this form of therapy is not for everyone. Home hemodialysis with the NxStage System One requires a patient and partner who are committed to being trained on and following the guidelines for proper system operation. The reported benefits of home hemodialysis may not be experienced by all patients. The NxStage System One is a prescription device and, like all medical devices, involves some risks. The risks associated with hemodialysis treatments in any environment include, but are not limited to, high blood pressure, fluid overload, low blood pressure, heart-related issues, and vascular access complications. The medical devices used in hemodialysis therapies may add additional risks including air entering the bloodstream, and blood loss due to clotting or accidental disconnection of the blood tubing set. Patients should consult with their doctor to understand the risks and responsibilities of home and/or more frequent hemodialysis using the NxStage System One.
Certain risks are unique to the home. Treatments at home are done without the presence of medical personnel and on-site technical support. Patients and their partners must be trained on what to do and how to get medical or technical help if needed. Certain risks associated with hemodialysis treatment are increased when performing nocturnal therapy due to the length of treatment time and because therapy is performed while the patient and care partner are sleeping. These risks include, but are not limited to, blood access disconnects and blood loss during sleep, blood clotting due to slower blood flow or increased treatment time or both, and delayed response to alarms when waking from sleep. Patients should consult with their physician to understand the risks and responsibilities associated with home nocturnal hemodialysis using the NxStage System One.
