My husband, Jim, worked with Ron at GM.  We bought a home in the country.  Took a walk one day and found out that Ron & Judy were our neighbors.  A Pleasant surprise. We have enjoyed the walks, talks and shared meals with Ron and Judy.  So shocked to hear of him passing.God bless you Judy and families.Love, Jim & Carol Donaldson, FL
