Daniel Platt Introduces Texture Tiles








¬†



 [August 2003]
Daniel Platt Introduces Texture Tiles

    Specialist tiling manufacturer Daniel Platt Ltd (Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, 
    England) has just launched an innovative range of texture finish tiles to 
    complement its natural clay and ferrolite pressed clay tile products. The 
    company recommends Daniel Platt Texture Tiles as perfect for all manner of 
    domestic flooring applications, especially in kitchens, conservatories and 
    hallways.

    "In creating new Texture Tiles," commented Managing Director Ian 
    Forbes, "we have combined an authentic quarry tile look and feel along 
    with levels of precision that are simply not available from a traditionally-made 
    quarry tile product."

    Available in traditional red, black or cream - and in square or octagonal 
    sizes - the new products can also be used along with the company's distinctive 
    'Accent' tiles, a range that is offered in 11 colours.

    "By combining our octagonal Texture Tiles with Accent tiles in the laying 
    pattern, truly individual and breathtaking effects can be achieved," 
    added Ian Forbes. "Alternatively, the Accent tiles can be used to create 
    complementary borders and mosaics."
