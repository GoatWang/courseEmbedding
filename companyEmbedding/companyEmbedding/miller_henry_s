Coors Light is bottled cold and never heat pasteurized, which means you get the ultimate in cold refreshment, every time.

Miller Lite
Miller Lite is the original light beer. Introduced in 1975, Miller Lite was brewed to be a great tasting beer that just happened to be light, not some lesser version of a full-calorie beer. While many other light beers have been developed over the years, Miller Lite remains the original, always upholding Miller’s commitment to “quality uncompromising and unchanging.” The Miller Lite recipe uses a unique blend of choice Saaz and Pacific Northwest hops and a significant amount of caramel malt. In addition, we are still proud to use the same strain of brewer’s yeast that Frederick Miller brought with him from Germany in the 1850’s. Our beer continues to be purposefully brewed for more taste, aroma and golden color than other light beers, with just 96 calories. 
Ingredients: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Dextrose), Yeast, Hops and Hop Extract

Miller High Life 
Miller High Life, also known as the Champagne of Beers, is a quintessentially classic, American-style lager. In 1903, Frederick Miller created Miller High Life because he believed that the good life, the High Life, should be accessible to everyone, not just the upper crust. To this day, Miller High Life continues to be faithfully brewed as a golden pilsner, utilizing light-stable galena hops from the Pacific Northwest and a select combination of malted barley.
Ingredients: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Maltose), Yeast, Hop Extract

Pilsner Urquell
Pilsner Urquell was first brewed in the city of Pilsen, Czech Republic, in 1842. As the original golden lager, its brilliant clarity, 24 karat golden color, spicy, bright Saaz hop aromatics and buttered fresh baguette malt character made it an instant success in a world that was accustomed only to dark, heavy, cloudy beers. Even the name Pilsner Urquell, which literally means "pilsner from the original source," acclaims its role in creating the most influential style of beer on Earth today.

Herman Joseph's Private Reserve
Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve is a German-style lager brewed by AC Golden Brewing Company and sold only in Colorado. Born of German heritage dating back to 1868, Herman Joseph’s recipe combines the finest European and North American hops with our prized Moravian two-row barley.  Each small, 30-barrel brew begins with a slow and easy 120-minute boil. Select ingredients are added at the precise moment to build its taste complexities. Each brew is then chilled to 1°C and allowed to rest for weeks on end. This chill-lagering develops each Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve brew into a perfectly balanced, deep golden lager that is appreciated for its distinctive qualities and unmistakable crisp, clean finish.

Because of the extra time required to brew and age this rare beer, it takes us longer to craft Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve. We believe you will agree—it’s worth the wait.

Blue Moon White IPA
Everyone has heard of an IPA, but what about a White IPA?  We’re known for our Blue Moon ® Belgian White, so making a White IPA really intrigued us. We first started with Wheat, Valencia Orange Peel, and Coriander. Then we experimented with hop after hop until we found a rare German hop called Huell Melon.  It complements the citrus flavor in the beer.  Ultimately, it’s Hoppy, Unfiltered and Well-balanced.  Blue Moon® White IPA is the best of both styles.

Colorado Native Amber
Colorado Native Lager is the only beer brewed with barley grown in the San Luis Valley, Rocky Mountain water, 100% Colorado-grown hops, and the oldest variety of brewing yeast in the state. Colorado Native Lagers are brewed with 100% Colorado grown ingredients. The majority of the barley used to brew other beers in Colorado comes from out-of-state malt houses and the majority of the hops used to brew other beers in Colorado comes from the Pacific Northwest, Europe and New Zealand. Colorado Native Lagers are Colorado’s homegrown beers.

We do not ship brewing ingredients into the state, our bottles are made in Wheat Ridge, our cans are made in Golden, and we do not sell our beer outside the state. All of this adds up to a smaller carbon footprint and a great-tasting, all-Colorado beer. If you care about locally sourced food and beverage, no other beer is more local than Colorado Native.

Colorado Native Double IPL
Colorado Native Double IPL is similar to Double IPAs, but it accentuates the unique Colorado hop character as only a lager can. Lager yeast doesn’t create the fruity esters and fusel alcohols found in ale yeast ... so the delicate hop notes shine through in the beer.  And Double IPL is all about the hops - 3 pounds of hops per barrel, 5 varieties and 95 BUs.

Colorado Native Golden Lager
Colorado Native Golden Lager is brewed for those who want a locally brewed, all-Colorado beer, but don’t want the overpowering malt and hops of other locally brewed ales and lagers.... It delivers more than the mainstream pilsners, yet remains perfectly balanced and drinkable. This Golden Lager delivers the full flavor of a fine import or craft beer, but with a great deal more drinkability.  Each brew begins with a slow and easy 90-minute boil. Select hops are added to build taste complexities and balance the malt sweetness.  After fermentation, each brew is crash-cooled to 1° Celsius and allowed to rest (lager) for up to four weeks. This Chill-lagering develops each brew into a perfectly balanced, deep golden-copper lager that is appreciated for its unmistakable crisp, clean finish.
Ingredients: Water, barley malt, yeast, hops

Colorado Native IPL
Colorado Native IPL is a clean tasting, hoppy beer made with lager yeast (vs. ale yeast). We don’t believe the world needs another IPA. We do, however believe there is room for a beer that is similar to an IPA, but is one that highlights the hop character as only a lager can do…“An IPA done better”, if you will. To get this clean, crisp character, we brewed an “IPA style” beer, using lager yeast. The lager yeast is superior in this case because it doesn’t create all of the fruity esters and fusel alcohols that ale yeast create ... so it allows the delicate hop oils to shine through in the beer.
Ingredients: Water, barley malt, yeast, hops

Colorado Native Olathe
Whether it is fruits, vegetables, grains or hops, the fertile ground from Fruita to Palisade, down to Montrose, and from Paonia to Delta produces world class agriculture. To celebrate the harvest season, we brew this lager as a tip of the hat to those Colorado farmers who work the ground to feed us all.  To provide the backbone for this German-style lager, we mashed in Charles two-row winter barley, Moravian two-row barley and world-renowned Olathe corn. We added Crystal and Nugget hops; grown in Olathe, within a mile of the barley and corn. The resulting taste has a rich, malty honey character with cleaning bitterness.

Colorado Native Peche
Colorado Native Peche features Colorado’s world famous peaches. We combined this amazing fruit with some of the finest barrel aged sour beer made in Colorado.  Colorado Native Peche is brewed with Colorado pale, caramel, and Munich malts.  The resulting beer is then relaxed in used neutral wine barrels for nearly a year with our house culture of microorganisms.  The beer is then fermented on fresh Colorado peaches at a rate of two pounds per gallon beer.  The resulting beer is crisp and dry while still gushing with fresh peach flavor.

Colorado Native Pilsner
Colorado Native Pilsner is brewed with 100% Colorado grown and malted barley. Other Colorado breweries buy the majority of their barley malt from out-of-state malt houses.   To give Colorado Native Pilsner its clean, crisp, and amazingly drinkable character, we begin with our proprietary Moravian two-row barley. Estate grown Tettnang, Crystal and Mt. Hood hops are added to give this Pilsner its subtle floral and spicy aroma and balanced bitterness.  After brewing, we chill-lager the beer at 1º Celsius to develop its distinctive taste and crisp, clean finish. We believe you will find Colorado Native Pilsner to be a Colorado-inspired, one-of-a-kind interpretation of a classic beer style.

Colorado Native Plum
Colorado Native Plum is brewed with delicious Duarte plums grown in Palisade Colorado. The plums are a dark shade of mahogany that go perfectly with an amber sour beer made of pale and caramel malts we had resting in Colorado whiskey barrels with our house microorganisms.  The beer has a rich fruity flavor with some notes of vanilla and oak.  It went perfectly with the addition of plums at a rate of one and a half pounds per gallon. The resulting beer is a deep red color, dry and tart, but with a complex richness.

Colorado Native Winterfest Pilsner
Everyone knows winter in Colorado is a wonderful time, especially around the holidays. The air seems crisper and snow covers the landscape like a natural gift wrapping. There’s just no other place like it. And that’s the feeling that inspired Colorado Native Winterfest. It’s our way of celebrating this special time of the year and toasting our friends in Colorado.  We brew Colorado Native Winterfest in September. We begin with our prized two-row barley, custom roasted to give the beer its rich, creamy flavor. Choice hops are added to create the aroma and festive taste. The finish is smooth, clean, sweet and rich with a depth of malt character.

Herman Joseph's Private Reserve
Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve is a German-style lager brewed by AC Golden Brewing Company and sold only in Colorado. Born of German heritage dating back to 1868, Herman Joseph’s recipe combines the finest European and North American hops with our prized Moravian two-row barley.  Each small, 30-barrel brew begins with a slow and easy 120-minute boil. Select ingredients are added at the precise moment to build its taste complexities. Each brew is then chilled to 1°C and allowed to rest for weeks on end. This chill-lagering develops each Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve brew into a perfectly balanced, deep golden lager that is appreciated for its distinctive qualities and unmistakable crisp, clean finish.

Because of the extra time required to brew and age this rare beer, it takes us longer to craft Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve. We believe you will agree—it’s worth the wait.

Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy
One day in 1922, Franz Kugler’s Munich tavern was flooded with 13,000 cyclists. Afraid the beer would run out, he mixed his Lager with lemonade, and the result was a hit. This soon inspired other beer mixtures like the shandy. Today, a shandy is beer mixed with a little something extra like soda, juice, lemonade or ginger ale. Leinenkugel’s® Summer Shandy® is our traditional Weiss beer with the refreshing natural lemonade flavor that makes it perfect for the sun-splashed summer months. For a fun and fresh food pairing, try it with lighter foods like shrimp quesadillas, pan-seared scallops with lemon vinaigrette, or lemon chicken with pasta.

Miller Lite
Miller Lite is the original light beer. Introduced in 1975, Miller Lite was brewed to be a great tasting beer that just happened to be light, not some lesser version of a full-calorie beer. While many other light beers have been developed over the years, Miller Lite remains the original, always upholding Miller’s commitment to “quality uncompromising and unchanging.” The Miller Lite recipe uses a unique blend of choice Saaz and Pacific Northwest hops and a significant amount of caramel malt. In addition, we are still proud to use the same strain of brewer’s yeast that Frederick Miller brought with him from Germany in the 1850’s. Our beer continues to be purposefully brewed for more taste, aroma and golden color than other light beers, with just 96 calories.

Life after ‘Shark Tank’ busy for Henry’s Humdingers

                    June 21, 2015 2:15 AM
                



It’s been quite a year for 18-year-old Henry Miller, and it doesn’t appear to be slowing down.
A little over a year ago Miller was on the popular ABC television show “Shark Tank,” pitching his company Henry’s Humdingers to investors. The company he founded sells raw honey combined with a variety of spices in jars with fun names like Grumpy Grampa and Diabolical Dad. In the episode, Miller was seen accepting $300,000 from two investors for 75 percent of the company, but Miller and the investors later decided to nix the deal in order to keep it as a family business.
While ultimately turning down the offer, being on the episode has done wonders for the business, which started out on the family farm in Deming. The company is introducing new flavors called Hanky Panky (which has vanilla and nutmeg) and Nudie Cutie (straight raw honey). The roll-out will be done on the television channel QVC. 
Miller will be on the QVC show called “Food Fest” with host Jill Bauer. It’s scheduled to run at noon Monday, June 22. The segment also will stream online and be available on the QVC website after the show has aired. 


Miller just graduated from high school in Ventura, Calif., and plans to attend Washington State University, majoring in economics with a minor in entrepreneurship. This summer he plans to focus on his company, which has its production facility in Burlington. Much of the work at the production facility is being run by his mom, Denise. The company has four employees.




“It has been very difficult juggling school and the business at the same time, which is why a lot of my summer will be dedicated towards helping the business grow,” Henry Miller said.
Since the airing of the “Shark Tank” episode in March 2014, sales have risen about 300 percent, Henry Miller said. Henry’s Humdingers products have landed in a variety of grocery store chains, including Haggen and Meijer. They soon be going into Akin’s and Chamberlin’s natural food stores. Miller also has had discussions with Target.
The company’s growth has reached a point where it can no longer get its honey from the Deming farm, but Miller said they buy raw honey from Washington state beekeepers. At this point Miller said Henry’s Humdingers is poised for the next stage in growth: Recently the company has received inquiries from companies in the food service industry, including a yogurt chain that is interested in the product as a possible topping option.
“I think we’re on the tipping point of getting huge,” he said.
The aftermath of being on “Shark Tank”also has been an interesting transition for Miller. He’s often recognized, particularly in this region, and people will ask to take a photo with him or have him sign a jar they’ve purchased. He’s also had celebrities enjoying his product, including restauranteur/television personality Fabio Viviani.



“‘Shark Tank’ has opened so many doors for us. I am so grateful to have been on that show. And it’s the gift that keeps on giving — every time it airs on CNBC, I get a great bump in business as more and more people discover my products,” Miller said.
While he didn’t close the deal with the sharks, he still has contact with the show. Mark Cuban, who initially wanted to buy 75 percent of the company with Robert Herjavec, offered to be one of Miller’s references in his college application. Cuban’s assistants also check in from time to time to see how the company is doing, Miller said.
Even with the national attention, Miller said it’s the local support that’s made a big impact, whether it’s from Whatcom and Skagit county residents ordering through the website or buying jars at the local Haggen stores.
“I really appreciate all the local support,” he said.

Signature



Henry Valentine Miller (December 26, 1891 – June 7, 1980) was an American writer, expatriated in Paris at his flourishing. He was known for breaking with existing literary forms, developing a new sort of semi-autobiographical novel that blended character study, social criticism, philosophical reflection, explicit language, sex, surrealist free association, and mysticism.[1][2] His most characteristic works of this kind are Tropic of Capricorn, The Colossus of Maroussi, The Time of the Assassins, and The Books in My Life, many of which are based on his experiences in New York and Paris (some of which were banned in the United States until 1961), adding Big Sur and the Oranges of Heronymous Bosch while finally residing in Big Sur, California.[3] He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism, and painted watercolors.[4]

Early life[edit]
Miller was born at his family's home, 450 East 85th Street, in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, New York City. He was the son of Lutheran German parents, Louise Marie (Neiting) and tailor Heinrich Miller.[5] As a child, he lived for nine years at 662 Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,[6] known at that time (and referred to frequently in his works) as the Fourteenth Ward. In 1900, his family moved to 1063 Decatur Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.[7] After finishing elementary school, although his family remained in Bushwick, Miller attended Eastern District High School in Williamsburg.[8] As a young man, he was active with the Socialist Party of America (his "quondam idol" was the black Socialist Hubert Harrison).[9] He attended the City College of New York for one semester.[10]
Career[edit]
Brooklyn, 1917–30[edit]
Miller married his first wife, Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, in 1917;[11] their divorce was granted on December 21, 1923.[12] Together they had a daughter, Barbara, born in 1919.[13] They lived in an apartment at 244 6th Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn.[14] At the time, Miller was working at Western Union; he worked there from 1920-24. In March 1922, during a three-week vacation, he wrote his first novel, Clipped Wings. It has never been published, and only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in other works, such as Tropic of Capricorn.[15] A study of twelve Western Union messengers, Miller called Clipped Wings "a long book and probably a very bad one."[16]
In 1923, while he was still married to Beatrice, Miller met and became enamored of a mysterious dance hall dancer who was born Juliet Edith Smerth but went by the stage name June Mansfield. She was 21 at the time.[17] They began an affair, and were married on June 1, 1924.[18] In 1924 Miller quit Western Union in order to dedicate himself completely to writing.[19] Miller later describes this time – his struggles to become a writer, his sexual escapades, failures, friends, and philosophy – in his autobiographical trilogy The Rosy Crucifixion.
Miller's second novel, Moloch: or, This Gentile World, was written in 1927–28, initially under the guise of a novel written by June.[20] A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it was hers.[21] The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death.[20] Moloch is based on Miller’s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan.[22] A third novel written around this time, Crazy Cock, also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled Lovely Lesbians, Crazy Cock (along with his later novel Nexus) told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later.[23] Kronski committed suicide around 1930.[24]
Paris, 1930–39[edit]
In 1928, Miller spent several months in Paris with June, a trip which was financed by Freedman.[22] One day in Paris, Miller met in the street another author, Robert W. Service, who recalled the story in his autobiography: "Soon we got into conversation which turned to books. For a stripling he spoke with some authority, turning into ridicule the pretentious scribes of the Latin Quarter and their freak magazine."[25] In 1930, Miller moved to Paris unaccompanied.[26] Soon after, he began work on Tropic of Cancer, writing to a friend, "I start tomorrow on the Paris book: First person, uncensored, formless - fuck everything!"[27] Although Miller had little or no money the first year in Paris, things began to change with the meeting of Anaïs Nin who, with Hugh Guiler, went on to pay his entire way through the 1930s including the rent for an apartment at 18 Villa Seurat. Nin became his lover and financed the first printing of Tropic of Cancer in 1934 with money from Otto Rank.[28] She would write extensively in her journals about her relationship with Miller and his wife June; the first volume, covering the years 1931-34, was published in 1966.[26] Late in 1934, June divorced Miller by proxy in Mexico City.[29]
In 1931, Miller was employed by the Chicago Tribune Paris edition, thanks to his friend Alfred Perlès who worked there, as a proofreader. Miller took this opportunity to submit some of his own articles under Perlès' name, since at that time only the editorial staff were permitted to publish in the paper. This period in Paris was highly creative for Miller, and during this time he also established a significant and influential network of authors circulating around the Villa Seurat.[30] At that time a young British author, Lawrence Durrell, became a lifelong friend. Miller's correspondence with Durrell was later published in two books.[31][32] During his Paris period he was also influenced by the French Surrealists.
His works contain detailed accounts of sexual experiences. His first published book, Tropic of Cancer (1934), was published by Obelisk Press in Paris and banned in the United States on the grounds of obscenity.[33] The dust jacket came wrapped with a warning: "Not to be imported into the United States or Great Britain."[34] He continued to write novels that were banned; along with Tropic of Cancer, his Black Spring (1936) and Tropic of Capricorn (1939) were smuggled into his native country, building Miller an underground reputation. While the aforementioned novels remained banned in the US for over two decades, in 1939, New Directions published The Cosmological Eye, Miller's first book to be published in America. The collection contained short prose pieces, most of which originally appeared in Black Spring and Max and the White Phagocytes (1938).[35]
Miller lived in France until June 1939.[36]
Greece, 1939–40[edit]
In 1939 Durrell, who lived in Corfu, invited Miller to Greece. Miller described the visit in The Colossus of Maroussi (1941), which he considered his best book.[19] One of the first acknowledgments of Henry Miller as a major modern writer was by George Orwell in his 1940 essay "Inside the Whale", where he wrote:

Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose-writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.[37]

California, 1942–80[edit]




A 1957 watercolor by Miller.



In 1940, Miller returned to New York; after a year-long trip around the United States, a journey that would become material for The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, he moved to California in June 1942, initially residing just outside Hollywood in Beverly Glen, before settling in Big Sur in 1944.[36] While Miller was establishing his base in Big Sur, the Tropic books, then still banned in the USA,[38] were being published in France by the Obelisk Press and later the Olympia Press. There they were acquiring a slow and steady notoriety among both Europeans and the various enclaves of American cultural exiles. As a result, the books were frequently smuggled into the States, where they proved to be a major influence on the new Beat Generation of American writers, most notably Jack Kerouac, the only Beat writer Miller truly cared for.[39] By the time his banned books were published in the 1960s and he was becoming increasingly well-known, Miller was no longer interested in his image as an outlaw writer of smut-filled books; however, he eventually gave up fighting the image.[40]
In 1942, shortly before moving to California, Miller began writing Sexus, the first novel in The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period of his life in Brooklyn falling in love with June and struggling to become a writer.[41] Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan.[42] In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in Sunday After The War (1944) and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (1945). His Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, published in 1957, is a collection of stories about his life and friends in Big Sur.[43]
In 1944, Miller met and married his third wife, Janina Martha Lepska, a philosophy student who was 30 years his junior.[26] They had two children: a son, Tony, and a daughter, Valentine.[44] They divorced in 1952. The following year, he married artist Eve McClure, who was 37 years his junior. They divorced in 1960,[26] and she died in 1966, likely as a result of alcoholism.[45] In 1961, Miller arranged a reunion in New York with his ex-wife and main subject of The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, June. They hadn't seen each other in nearly three decades. In a letter to Eve, he described his shock at June's "terrible" appearance, as she had by then degenerated both physically and mentally.[46]
In February 1963, Miller moved to 444 Ocampo Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, where he would spend the last 17 years of his life.[47] In 1967, Miller married his fifth wife, Hoki Tokuda.[48][49] In 1968, Miller signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.[50] After his move to Ocampo Drive, he held dinner parties for the artistic and literary figures of the time. His cook and caretaker was a young artist's model named Twinka Thiebaud who later wrote a book about his evening chats.[51] Thiebaud's memories of Miller's table talk were published in a rewritten and retitled book in 2011.[52]
Only 200 copies of Miller's 1972 chapbook On Turning Eighty were published. Published by Capra Press, in collaboration with Yes! Press, it was the first volume of the "Yes! Capra" chapbook series and is 34 pages in length.[53] The book contains three essays on topics such as aging and living a meaningful life. In relation to reaching 80 years of age, Miller explains:

If at eighty you’re not a cripple or an invalid, if you have your health, if you still enjoy a good walk, a good meal (with all the trimmings), if you can sleep without first taking a pill, if birds and flowers, mountains and sea still inspire you, you are a most fortunate individual and you should get down on your knees morning and night and thank the good Lord for his savin’ and keepin’ power.[54]

Late in life, Miller filmed with Warren Beatty for the 1981 film Reds, which was also directed by Beatty. He spoke of his remembrances of John Reed and Louise Bryant as part of a series of "witnesses." The film was released eighteen months after Miller's death.[55] During the last four years of his life, Miller held an ongoing correspondence of over 1,500 letters with Brenda Venus, a young Playboy playmate, actress and dancer. A book about their correspondence was published in 1986.[56]
Death[edit]
Miller died of circulatory complications at his home in Pacific Palisades on June 7, 1980, at the age of 88.[57] His body was cremated and his ashes shared between his son Tony and daughter Val. Tony has stated that he ultimately intends to have his ashes mixed with those of his father and scattered in Big Sur.[58]
US publication of previously banned works[edit]
The publication of Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press led to a series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein, citing Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature; it was one of the notable events in what has come to be known as the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published.[59] Following the trial, in 1964–65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: Black Spring, Tropic of Capricorn, Quiet Days in Clichy, Sexus, Plexus and Nexus.[60] Excerpts from some of these banned books, including Tropic of Cancer, Black Spring and Sexus, were first published in the US by New Directions in The Henry Miller Reader in 1959.[61][62]
Watercolors[edit]
In addition to his literary abilities, Miller produced numerous watercolor paintings and wrote books on this field. He was a close friend of the French painter Grégoire Michonze. It is estimated that Miller painted 2,000 watercolors during his life, and that 50 or more major collections of Miller’s paintings exist.[63] The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a selection of Miller's watercolors,[64] as did the Henry Miller Museum of Art in Ōmachi City in Nagano, Japan, before closing in 2001.[65] Miller's daughter Valentine placed some of her father's art for sale in 2005.[66] He was also an amateur pianist.[67]
Literary archives[edit]
Miller's papers can be found in the following library special collections:

Southern Illinois University Carbondale, which has correspondence and other archival collections.[68]
Syracuse University, which holds a portion of the correspondence between the Grove Press and Henry Miller.[69]
Charles E. Young Research Library of the University of California, Los Angeles Library.[70]
Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, which has materials about Miller from his first wife and their daughter.[71]
University of Victoria, which holds a significant collection of Miller's manuscripts and correspondence, including the corrected typescripts for Max and Quiet Days in Clichy, as well as Miller's lengthy correspondence with Alfred Perlès.[72]
University of Virginia.[73]
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University Library.[74]
University of Pennsylvania Libraries, Philadelphia, PA.[75]

Miller's friend Emil White founded the nonprofit Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur in 1981.[76] This houses a collection of his works and celebrates his literary, artistic and cultural legacy by providing a public gallery as well as performance and workshop spaces for artists, musicians, students, and writers.[76]
Literary references[edit]
Miller is considered a "literary innovator" in whose works "actual and imagined experiences became indistinguishable from each other."[77] His books did much to free the discussion of sexual subjects in American writing from both legal and social restrictions. He influenced many writers, including Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Theroux and Erica Jong.[34]
Throughout his novels he makes references to literature; he cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Balzac and Nietzsche as having a formative impact on him.[78]
Tropic of Cancer is referenced in Junot Díaz's 2007 book The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao as being read by Ana Obregón. Miller's legal difficulties, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn are mentioned in Denis Johnson's 2007 novel Tree of Smoke, in a conversation between Skip Sands and his uncle, Colonel Sands. Miller is mentioned again later in the novel.[79]

Films[edit]
Miller as himself[edit]
Miller appeared as himself in several films:[80]

He was the subject of four documentary films by Robert Snyder; The Henry Miller Odyssey (90 minutes), Henry Miller: Reflections On Writing (47 minutes), and Henry Miller Reads and Muses (60 minutes). In addition, there is a film by Snyder that was completed after Snyder's death in 2004 about Miller's watercolor paintings, Henry Miller: To Paint Is To Love Again (60 minutes). All four films are in Miller's own words.
He was a "witness" (interviewee) in Warren Beatty's 1981 film Reds.[81]
He was featured in the 1996 documentary Henry Miller Is Not Dead that featured music by Laurie Anderson.[82]

Actors portraying Miller[edit]
Several actors played Miller on film, such as:

Rip Torn in the 1970 film adaptation of Tropic of Cancer.
In the 1970 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy, the Miller-based character of 'Joey' was played by Paul Valjean.
Fred Ward in the 1990 film Henry & June, based on the diaries of Anaïs Nin.
David Brandon in the 1990 film The Room of Words (La Stanza Delle Parole), also based on Nin's diaries.
Claude Chabrol's 1990 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy saw Andrew McCarthy play Miller.

Signature



Henry Valentine Miller (December 26, 1891 – June 7, 1980) was an American writer, expatriated in Paris at his flourishing. He was known for breaking with existing literary forms, developing a new sort of semi-autobiographical novel that blended character study, social criticism, philosophical reflection, explicit language, sex, surrealist free association, and mysticism.[1][2] His most characteristic works of this kind are Tropic of Capricorn, The Colossus of Maroussi, The Time of the Assassins, and The Books in My Life, many of which are based on his experiences in New York and Paris (some of which were banned in the United States until 1961), adding Big Sur and the Oranges of Heronymous Bosch while finally residing in Big Sur, California.[3] He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism, and painted watercolors.[4]

Early life[edit]
Miller was born at his family's home, 450 East 85th Street, in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, New York City. He was the son of Lutheran German parents, Louise Marie (Neiting) and tailor Heinrich Miller.[5] As a child, he lived for nine years at 662 Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,[6] known at that time (and referred to frequently in his works) as the Fourteenth Ward. In 1900, his family moved to 1063 Decatur Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.[7] After finishing elementary school, although his family remained in Bushwick, Miller attended Eastern District High School in Williamsburg.[8] As a young man, he was active with the Socialist Party of America (his "quondam idol" was the black Socialist Hubert Harrison).[9] He attended the City College of New York for one semester.[10]
Career[edit]
Brooklyn, 1917–30[edit]
Miller married his first wife, Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, in 1917;[11] their divorce was granted on December 21, 1923.[12] Together they had a daughter, Barbara, born in 1919.[13] They lived in an apartment at 244 6th Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn.[14] At the time, Miller was working at Western Union; he worked there from 1920-24. In March 1922, during a three-week vacation, he wrote his first novel, Clipped Wings. It has never been published, and only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in other works, such as Tropic of Capricorn.[15] A study of twelve Western Union messengers, Miller called Clipped Wings "a long book and probably a very bad one."[16]
In 1923, while he was still married to Beatrice, Miller met and became enamored of a mysterious dance hall dancer who was born Juliet Edith Smerth but went by the stage name June Mansfield. She was 21 at the time.[17] They began an affair, and were married on June 1, 1924.[18] In 1924 Miller quit Western Union in order to dedicate himself completely to writing.[19] Miller later describes this time – his struggles to become a writer, his sexual escapades, failures, friends, and philosophy – in his autobiographical trilogy The Rosy Crucifixion.
Miller's second novel, Moloch: or, This Gentile World, was written in 1927–28, initially under the guise of a novel written by June.[20] A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it was hers.[21] The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death.[20] Moloch is based on Miller’s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan.[22] A third novel written around this time, Crazy Cock, also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled Lovely Lesbians, Crazy Cock (along with his later novel Nexus) told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later.[23] Kronski committed suicide around 1930.[24]
Paris, 1930–39[edit]
In 1928, Miller spent several months in Paris with June, a trip which was financed by Freedman.[22] One day in Paris, Miller met in the street another author, Robert W. Service, who recalled the story in his autobiography: "Soon we got into conversation which turned to books. For a stripling he spoke with some authority, turning into ridicule the pretentious scribes of the Latin Quarter and their freak magazine."[25] In 1930, Miller moved to Paris unaccompanied.[26] Soon after, he began work on Tropic of Cancer, writing to a friend, "I start tomorrow on the Paris book: First person, uncensored, formless - fuck everything!"[27] Although Miller had little or no money the first year in Paris, things began to change with the meeting of Anaïs Nin who, with Hugh Guiler, went on to pay his entire way through the 1930s including the rent for an apartment at 18 Villa Seurat. Nin became his lover and financed the first printing of Tropic of Cancer in 1934 with money from Otto Rank.[28] She would write extensively in her journals about her relationship with Miller and his wife June; the first volume, covering the years 1931-34, was published in 1966.[26] Late in 1934, June divorced Miller by proxy in Mexico City.[29]
In 1931, Miller was employed by the Chicago Tribune Paris edition, thanks to his friend Alfred Perlès who worked there, as a proofreader. Miller took this opportunity to submit some of his own articles under Perlès' name, since at that time only the editorial staff were permitted to publish in the paper. This period in Paris was highly creative for Miller, and during this time he also established a significant and influential network of authors circulating around the Villa Seurat.[30] At that time a young British author, Lawrence Durrell, became a lifelong friend. Miller's correspondence with Durrell was later published in two books.[31][32] During his Paris period he was also influenced by the French Surrealists.
His works contain detailed accounts of sexual experiences. His first published book, Tropic of Cancer (1934), was published by Obelisk Press in Paris and banned in the United States on the grounds of obscenity.[33] The dust jacket came wrapped with a warning: "Not to be imported into the United States or Great Britain."[34] He continued to write novels that were banned; along with Tropic of Cancer, his Black Spring (1936) and Tropic of Capricorn (1939) were smuggled into his native country, building Miller an underground reputation. While the aforementioned novels remained banned in the US for over two decades, in 1939, New Directions published The Cosmological Eye, Miller's first book to be published in America. The collection contained short prose pieces, most of which originally appeared in Black Spring and Max and the White Phagocytes (1938).[35]
Miller lived in France until June 1939.[36]
Greece, 1939–40[edit]
In 1939 Durrell, who lived in Corfu, invited Miller to Greece. Miller described the visit in The Colossus of Maroussi (1941), which he considered his best book.[19] One of the first acknowledgments of Henry Miller as a major modern writer was by George Orwell in his 1940 essay "Inside the Whale", where he wrote:

Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose-writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.[37]

California, 1942–80[edit]

In 1940, Miller returned to New York; after a year-long trip around the United States, a journey that would become material for The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, he moved to California in June 1942, initially residing just outside Hollywood in Beverly Glen, before settling in Big Sur in 1944.[36] While Miller was establishing his base in Big Sur, the Tropic books, then still banned in the USA,[38] were being published in France by the Obelisk Press and later the Olympia Press. There they were acquiring a slow and steady notoriety among both Europeans and the various enclaves of American cultural exiles. As a result, the books were frequently smuggled into the States, where they proved to be a major influence on the new Beat Generation of American writers, most notably Jack Kerouac, the only Beat writer Miller truly cared for.[39] By the time his banned books were published in the 1960s and he was becoming increasingly well-known, Miller was no longer interested in his image as an outlaw writer of smut-filled books; however, he eventually gave up fighting the image.[40]
In 1942, shortly before moving to California, Miller began writing Sexus, the first novel in The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period of his life in Brooklyn falling in love with June and struggling to become a writer.[41] Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan.[42] In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in Sunday After The War (1944) and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (1945). His Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, published in 1957, is a collection of stories about his life and friends in Big Sur.[43]
In 1944, Miller met and married his third wife, Janina Martha Lepska, a philosophy student who was 30 years his junior.[26] They had two children: a son, Tony, and a daughter, Valentine.[44] They divorced in 1952. The following year, he married artist Eve McClure, who was 37 years his junior. They divorced in 1960,[26] and she died in 1966, likely as a result of alcoholism.[45] In 1961, Miller arranged a reunion in New York with his ex-wife and main subject of The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, June. They hadn't seen each other in nearly three decades. In a letter to Eve, he described his shock at June's "terrible" appearance, as she had by then degenerated both physically and mentally.[46]
In February 1963, Miller moved to 444 Ocampo Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, where he would spend the last 17 years of his life.[47] In 1967, Miller married his fifth wife, Hoki Tokuda.[48][49] In 1968, Miller signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.[50] After his move to Ocampo Drive, he held dinner parties for the artistic and literary figures of the time. His cook and caretaker was a young artist's model named Twinka Thiebaud who later wrote a book about his evening chats.[51] Thiebaud's memories of Miller's table talk were published in a rewritten and retitled book in 2011.[52]
Only 200 copies of Miller's 1972 chapbook On Turning Eighty were published. Published by Capra Press, in collaboration with Yes! Press, it was the first volume of the "Yes! Capra" chapbook series and is 34 pages in length.[53] The book contains three essays on topics such as aging and living a meaningful life. In relation to reaching 80 years of age, Miller explains:

If at eighty you’re not a cripple or an invalid, if you have your health, if you still enjoy a good walk, a good meal (with all the trimmings), if you can sleep without first taking a pill, if birds and flowers, mountains and sea still inspire you, you are a most fortunate individual and you should get down on your knees morning and night and thank the good Lord for his savin’ and keepin’ power.[54]

Late in life, Miller filmed with Warren Beatty for the 1981 film Reds, which was also directed by Beatty. He spoke of his remembrances of John Reed and Louise Bryant as part of a series of "witnesses." The film was released eighteen months after Miller's death.[55] During the last four years of his life, Miller held an ongoing correspondence of over 1,500 letters with Brenda Venus, a young Playboy playmate, actress and dancer. A book about their correspondence was published in 1986.[56]
Death[edit]
Miller died of circulatory complications at his home in Pacific Palisades on June 7, 1980, at the age of 88.[57] His body was cremated and his ashes shared between his son Tony and daughter Val. Tony has stated that he ultimately intends to have his ashes mixed with those of his father and scattered in Big Sur.[58]
US publication of previously banned works[edit]
The publication of Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press led to a series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein, citing Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature; it was one of the notable events in what has come to be known as the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published.[59] Following the trial, in 1964–65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: Black Spring, Tropic of Capricorn, Quiet Days in Clichy, Sexus, Plexus and Nexus.[60] Excerpts from some of these banned books, including Tropic of Cancer, Black Spring and Sexus, were first published in the US by New Directions in The Henry Miller Reader in 1959.[61][62]
Watercolors[edit]
In addition to his literary abilities, Miller produced numerous watercolor paintings and wrote books on this field. He was a close friend of the French painter Grégoire Michonze. It is estimated that Miller painted 2,000 watercolors during his life, and that 50 or more major collections of Miller’s paintings exist.[63] The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a selection of Miller's watercolors,[64] as did the Henry Miller Museum of Art in Ōmachi City in Nagano, Japan, before closing in 2001.[65] Miller's daughter Valentine placed some of her father's art for sale in 2005.[66] He was also an amateur pianist.[67]
Literary archives[edit]
Miller's papers can be found in the following library special collections:

Southern Illinois University Carbondale, which has correspondence and other archival collections.[68]
Syracuse University, which holds a portion of the correspondence between the Grove Press and Henry Miller.[69]
Charles E. Young Research Library of the University of California, Los Angeles Library.[70]
Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, which has materials about Miller from his first wife and their daughter.[71]
University of Victoria, which holds a significant collection of Miller's manuscripts and correspondence, including the corrected typescripts for Max and Quiet Days in Clichy, as well as Miller's lengthy correspondence with Alfred Perlès.[72]
University of Virginia.[73]
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University Library.[74]
University of Pennsylvania Libraries, Philadelphia, PA.[75]

Miller's friend Emil White founded the nonprofit Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur in 1981.[76] This houses a collection of his works and celebrates his literary, artistic and cultural legacy by providing a public gallery as well as performance and workshop spaces for artists, musicians, students, and writers.[76]
Literary references[edit]
Miller is considered a "literary innovator" in whose works "actual and imagined experiences became indistinguishable from each other."[77] His books did much to free the discussion of sexual subjects in American writing from both legal and social restrictions. He influenced many writers, including Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Theroux and Erica Jong.[34]
Throughout his novels he makes references to literature; he cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Balzac and Nietzsche as having a formative impact on him.[78]
Tropic of Cancer is referenced in Junot Díaz's 2007 book The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao as being read by Ana Obregón. Miller's legal difficulties, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn are mentioned in Denis Johnson's 2007 novel Tree of Smoke, in a conversation between Skip Sands and his uncle, Colonel Sands. Miller is mentioned again later in the novel.[79]

Films[edit]
Miller as himself[edit]
Miller appeared as himself in several films:[80]

He was the subject of four documentary films by Robert Snyder; The Henry Miller Odyssey (90 minutes), Henry Miller: Reflections On Writing (47 minutes), and Henry Miller Reads and Muses (60 minutes). In addition, there is a film by Snyder that was completed after Snyder's death in 2004 about Miller's watercolor paintings, Henry Miller: To Paint Is To Love Again (60 minutes). All four films are in Miller's own words.
He was a "witness" (interviewee) in Warren Beatty's 1981 film Reds.[81]
He was featured in the 1996 documentary Henry Miller Is Not Dead that featured music by Laurie Anderson.[82]

Actors portraying Miller[edit]
Several actors played Miller on film, such as:

Rip Torn in the 1970 film adaptation of Tropic of Cancer.
In the 1970 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy, the Miller-based character of 'Joey' was played by Paul Valjean.
Fred Ward in the 1990 film Henry & June, based on the diaries of Anaïs Nin.
David Brandon in the 1990 film The Room of Words (La Stanza Delle Parole), also based on Nin's diaries.
Claude Chabrol's 1990 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy saw Andrew McCarthy play Miller.

Signature



Henry Valentine Miller (December 26, 1891 – June 7, 1980) was an American writer, expatriated in Paris at his flourishing. He was known for breaking with existing literary forms, developing a new sort of semi-autobiographical novel that blended character study, social criticism, philosophical reflection, explicit language, sex, surrealist free association, and mysticism.[1][2] His most characteristic works of this kind are Tropic of Capricorn, The Colossus of Maroussi, The Time of the Assassins, and The Books in My Life, many of which are based on his experiences in New York and Paris (some of which were banned in the United States until 1961), adding Big Sur and the Oranges of Heronymous Bosch while finally residing in Big Sur, California.[3] He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism, and painted watercolors.[4]

Early life[edit]
Miller was born at his family's home, 450 East 85th Street, in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, New York City. He was the son of Lutheran German parents, Louise Marie (Neiting) and tailor Heinrich Miller.[5] As a child, he lived for nine years at 662 Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,[6] known at that time (and referred to frequently in his works) as the Fourteenth Ward. In 1900, his family moved to 1063 Decatur Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.[7] After finishing elementary school, although his family remained in Bushwick, Miller attended Eastern District High School in Williamsburg.[8] As a young man, he was active with the Socialist Party of America (his "quondam idol" was the black Socialist Hubert Harrison).[9] He attended the City College of New York for one semester.[10]
Career[edit]
Brooklyn, 1917–30[edit]
Miller married his first wife, Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, in 1917;[11] their divorce was granted on December 21, 1923.[12] Together they had a daughter, Barbara, born in 1919.[13] They lived in an apartment at 244 6th Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn.[14] At the time, Miller was working at Western Union; he worked there from 1920-24. In March 1922, during a three-week vacation, he wrote his first novel, Clipped Wings. It has never been published, and only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in other works, such as Tropic of Capricorn.[15] A study of twelve Western Union messengers, Miller called Clipped Wings "a long book and probably a very bad one."[16]
In 1923, while he was still married to Beatrice, Miller met and became enamored of a mysterious dance hall dancer who was born Juliet Edith Smerth but went by the stage name June Mansfield. She was 21 at the time.[17] They began an affair, and were married on June 1, 1924.[18] In 1924 Miller quit Western Union in order to dedicate himself completely to writing.[19] Miller later describes this time – his struggles to become a writer, his sexual escapades, failures, friends, and philosophy – in his autobiographical trilogy The Rosy Crucifixion.
Miller's second novel, Moloch: or, This Gentile World, was written in 1927–28, initially under the guise of a novel written by June.[20] A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it was hers.[21] The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death.[20] Moloch is based on Miller’s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan.[22] A third novel written around this time, Crazy Cock, also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled Lovely Lesbians, Crazy Cock (along with his later novel Nexus) told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later.[23] Kronski committed suicide around 1930.[24]
Paris, 1930–39[edit]
In 1928, Miller spent several months in Paris with June, a trip which was financed by Freedman.[22] One day in Paris, Miller met in the street another author, Robert W. Service, who recalled the story in his autobiography: "Soon we got into conversation which turned to books. For a stripling he spoke with some authority, turning into ridicule the pretentious scribes of the Latin Quarter and their freak magazine."[25] In 1930, Miller moved to Paris unaccompanied.[26] Soon after, he began work on Tropic of Cancer, writing to a friend, "I start tomorrow on the Paris book: First person, uncensored, formless - fuck everything!"[27] Although Miller had little or no money the first year in Paris, things began to change with the meeting of Anaïs Nin who, with Hugh Guiler, went on to pay his entire way through the 1930s including the rent for an apartment at 18 Villa Seurat. Nin became his lover and financed the first printing of Tropic of Cancer in 1934 with money from Otto Rank.[28] She would write extensively in her journals about her relationship with Miller and his wife June; the first volume, covering the years 1931-34, was published in 1966.[26] Late in 1934, June divorced Miller by proxy in Mexico City.[29]
In 1931, Miller was employed by the Chicago Tribune Paris edition, thanks to his friend Alfred Perlès who worked there, as a proofreader. Miller took this opportunity to submit some of his own articles under Perlès' name, since at that time only the editorial staff were permitted to publish in the paper. This period in Paris was highly creative for Miller, and during this time he also established a significant and influential network of authors circulating around the Villa Seurat.[30] At that time a young British author, Lawrence Durrell, became a lifelong friend. Miller's correspondence with Durrell was later published in two books.[31][32] During his Paris period he was also influenced by the French Surrealists.
His works contain detailed accounts of sexual experiences. His first published book, Tropic of Cancer (1934), was published by Obelisk Press in Paris and banned in the United States on the grounds of obscenity.[33] The dust jacket came wrapped with a warning: "Not to be imported into the United States or Great Britain."[34] He continued to write novels that were banned; along with Tropic of Cancer, his Black Spring (1936) and Tropic of Capricorn (1939) were smuggled into his native country, building Miller an underground reputation. While the aforementioned novels remained banned in the US for over two decades, in 1939, New Directions published The Cosmological Eye, Miller's first book to be published in America. The collection contained short prose pieces, most of which originally appeared in Black Spring and Max and the White Phagocytes (1938).[35]
Miller lived in France until June 1939.[36]
Greece, 1939–40[edit]
In 1939 Durrell, who lived in Corfu, invited Miller to Greece. Miller described the visit in The Colossus of Maroussi (1941), which he considered his best book.[19] One of the first acknowledgments of Henry Miller as a major modern writer was by George Orwell in his 1940 essay "Inside the Whale", where he wrote:

Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose-writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.[37]

California, 1942–80[edit]

In 1940, Miller returned to New York; after a year-long trip around the United States, a journey that would become material for The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, he moved to California in June 1942, initially residing just outside Hollywood in Beverly Glen, before settling in Big Sur in 1944.[36] While Miller was establishing his base in Big Sur, the Tropic books, then still banned in the USA,[38] were being published in France by the Obelisk Press and later the Olympia Press. There they were acquiring a slow and steady notoriety among both Europeans and the various enclaves of American cultural exiles. As a result, the books were frequently smuggled into the States, where they proved to be a major influence on the new Beat Generation of American writers, most notably Jack Kerouac, the only Beat writer Miller truly cared for.[39] By the time his banned books were published in the 1960s and he was becoming increasingly well-known, Miller was no longer interested in his image as an outlaw writer of smut-filled books; however, he eventually gave up fighting the image.[40]
In 1942, shortly before moving to California, Miller began writing Sexus, the first novel in The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period of his life in Brooklyn falling in love with June and struggling to become a writer.[41] Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan.[42] In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in Sunday After The War (1944) and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (1945). His Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, published in 1957, is a collection of stories about his life and friends in Big Sur.[43]
In 1944, Miller met and married his third wife, Janina Martha Lepska, a philosophy student who was 30 years his junior.[26] They had two children: a son, Tony, and a daughter, Valentine.[44] They divorced in 1952. The following year, he married artist Eve McClure, who was 37 years his junior. They divorced in 1960,[26] and she died in 1966, likely as a result of alcoholism.[45] In 1961, Miller arranged a reunion in New York with his ex-wife and main subject of The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, June. They hadn't seen each other in nearly three decades. In a letter to Eve, he described his shock at June's "terrible" appearance, as she had by then degenerated both physically and mentally.[46]
In February 1963, Miller moved to 444 Ocampo Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, where he would spend the last 17 years of his life.[47] In 1967, Miller married his fifth wife, Hoki Tokuda.[48][49] In 1968, Miller signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.[50] After his move to Ocampo Drive, he held dinner parties for the artistic and literary figures of the time. His cook and caretaker was a young artist's model named Twinka Thiebaud who later wrote a book about his evening chats.[51] Thiebaud's memories of Miller's table talk were published in a rewritten and retitled book in 2011.[52]
Only 200 copies of Miller's 1972 chapbook On Turning Eighty were published. Published by Capra Press, in collaboration with Yes! Press, it was the first volume of the "Yes! Capra" chapbook series and is 34 pages in length.[53] The book contains three essays on topics such as aging and living a meaningful life. In relation to reaching 80 years of age, Miller explains:

If at eighty you’re not a cripple or an invalid, if you have your health, if you still enjoy a good walk, a good meal (with all the trimmings), if you can sleep without first taking a pill, if birds and flowers, mountains and sea still inspire you, you are a most fortunate individual and you should get down on your knees morning and night and thank the good Lord for his savin’ and keepin’ power.[54]

Late in life, Miller filmed with Warren Beatty for the 1981 film Reds, which was also directed by Beatty. He spoke of his remembrances of John Reed and Louise Bryant as part of a series of "witnesses." The film was released eighteen months after Miller's death.[55] During the last four years of his life, Miller held an ongoing correspondence of over 1,500 letters with Brenda Venus, a young Playboy playmate, actress and dancer. A book about their correspondence was published in 1986.[56]
Death[edit]
Miller died of circulatory complications at his home in Pacific Palisades on June 7, 1980, at the age of 88.[57] His body was cremated and his ashes shared between his son Tony and daughter Val. Tony has stated that he ultimately intends to have his ashes mixed with those of his father and scattered in Big Sur.[58]
US publication of previously banned works[edit]
The publication of Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press led to a series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein, citing Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature; it was one of the notable events in what has come to be known as the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published.[59] Following the trial, in 1964–65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: Black Spring, Tropic of Capricorn, Quiet Days in Clichy, Sexus, Plexus and Nexus.[60] Excerpts from some of these banned books, including Tropic of Cancer, Black Spring and Sexus, were first published in the US by New Directions in The Henry Miller Reader in 1959.[61][62]
Watercolors[edit]
In addition to his literary abilities, Miller produced numerous watercolor paintings and wrote books on this field. He was a close friend of the French painter Grégoire Michonze. It is estimated that Miller painted 2,000 watercolors during his life, and that 50 or more major collections of Miller’s paintings exist.[63] The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a selection of Miller's watercolors,[64] as did the Henry Miller Museum of Art in Ōmachi City in Nagano, Japan, before closing in 2001.[65] Miller's daughter Valentine placed some of her father's art for sale in 2005.[66] He was also an amateur pianist.[67]
Literary archives[edit]
Miller's papers can be found in the following library special collections:

Southern Illinois University Carbondale, which has correspondence and other archival collections.[68]
Syracuse University, which holds a portion of the correspondence between the Grove Press and Henry Miller.[69]
Charles E. Young Research Library of the University of California, Los Angeles Library.[70]
Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, which has materials about Miller from his first wife and their daughter.[71]
University of Victoria, which holds a significant collection of Miller's manuscripts and correspondence, including the corrected typescripts for Max and Quiet Days in Clichy, as well as Miller's lengthy correspondence with Alfred Perlès.[72]
University of Virginia.[73]
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University Library.[74]
University of Pennsylvania Libraries, Philadelphia, PA.[75]

Miller's friend Emil White founded the nonprofit Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur in 1981.[76] This houses a collection of his works and celebrates his literary, artistic and cultural legacy by providing a public gallery as well as performance and workshop spaces for artists, musicians, students, and writers.[76]
Literary references[edit]
Miller is considered a "literary innovator" in whose works "actual and imagined experiences became indistinguishable from each other."[77] His books did much to free the discussion of sexual subjects in American writing from both legal and social restrictions. He influenced many writers, including Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Theroux and Erica Jong.[34]
Throughout his novels he makes references to literature; he cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Balzac and Nietzsche as having a formative impact on him.[78]
Tropic of Cancer is referenced in Junot Díaz's 2007 book The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao as being read by Ana Obregón. Miller's legal difficulties, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn are mentioned in Denis Johnson's 2007 novel Tree of Smoke, in a conversation between Skip Sands and his uncle, Colonel Sands. Miller is mentioned again later in the novel.[79]

Films[edit]
Miller as himself[edit]
Miller appeared as himself in several films:[80]

He was the subject of four documentary films by Robert Snyder; The Henry Miller Odyssey (90 minutes), Henry Miller: Reflections On Writing (47 minutes), and Henry Miller Reads and Muses (60 minutes). In addition, there is a film by Snyder that was completed after Snyder's death in 2004 about Miller's watercolor paintings, Henry Miller: To Paint Is To Love Again (60 minutes). All four films are in Miller's own words.
He was a "witness" (interviewee) in Warren Beatty's 1981 film Reds.[81]
He was featured in the 1996 documentary Henry Miller Is Not Dead that featured music by Laurie Anderson.[82]

Actors portraying Miller[edit]
Several actors played Miller on film, such as:

Rip Torn in the 1970 film adaptation of Tropic of Cancer.
In the 1970 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy, the Miller-based character of 'Joey' was played by Paul Valjean.
Fred Ward in the 1990 film Henry & June, based on the diaries of Anaïs Nin.
David Brandon in the 1990 film The Room of Words (La Stanza Delle Parole), also based on Nin's diaries.
Claude Chabrol's 1990 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy saw Andrew McCarthy play Miller.

Henry Valentine Miller (December 26, 1891 – June 7, 1980) was an American writer, expatriated in Paris at his flourishing. He was known for breaking with existing literary forms, developing a new sort of semi-autobiographical novel that blended character study, social criticism, philosophical reflection, explicit language, sex, surrealist free association, and mysticism.[1][2] His most characteristic works of this kind are Tropic of Capricorn, The Colossus of Maroussi, The Time of the Assassins, and The Books in My Life, many of which are based on his experiences in New York and Paris (some of which were banned in the United States until 1961), adding Big Sur and the Oranges of Heronymous Bosch while finally residing in Big Sur, California.[3] He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism, and painted watercolors.[4]

Early life[edit]
Miller was born at his family's home, 450 East 85th Street, in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, New York City. He was the son of Lutheran German parents, Louise Marie (Neiting) and tailor Heinrich Miller.[5] As a child, he lived for nine years at 662 Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,[6] known at that time (and referred to frequently in his works) as the Fourteenth Ward. In 1900, his family moved to 1063 Decatur Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.[7] After finishing elementary school, although his family remained in Bushwick, Miller attended Eastern District High School in Williamsburg.[8] As a young man, he was active with the Socialist Party of America (his "quondam idol" was the black Socialist Hubert Harrison).[9] He attended the City College of New York for one semester.[10]
Career[edit]
Brooklyn, 1917–30[edit]
Miller married his first wife, Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, in 1917;[11] their divorce was granted on December 21, 1923.[12] Together they had a daughter, Barbara, born in 1919.[13] They lived in an apartment at 244 6th Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn.[14] At the time, Miller was working at Western Union; he worked there from 1920-24. In March 1922, during a three-week vacation, he wrote his first novel, Clipped Wings. It has never been published, and only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in other works, such as Tropic of Capricorn.[15] A study of twelve Western Union messengers, Miller called Clipped Wings "a long book and probably a very bad one."[16]
In 1923, while he was still married to Beatrice, Miller met and became enamored of a mysterious dance hall dancer who was born Juliet Edith Smerth but went by the stage name June Mansfield. She was 21 at the time.[17] They began an affair, and were married on June 1, 1924.[18] In 1924 Miller quit Western Union in order to dedicate himself completely to writing.[19] Miller later describes this time – his struggles to become a writer, his sexual escapades, failures, friends, and philosophy – in his autobiographical trilogy The Rosy Crucifixion.
Miller's second novel, Moloch: or, This Gentile World, was written in 1927–28, initially under the guise of a novel written by June.[20] A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it was hers.[21] The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death.[20] Moloch is based on Miller’s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan.[22] A third novel written around this time, Crazy Cock, also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled Lovely Lesbians, Crazy Cock (along with his later novel Nexus) told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later.[23] Kronski committed suicide around 1930.[24]
Paris, 1930–39[edit]
In 1928, Miller spent several months in Paris with June, a trip which was financed by Freedman.[22] One day in Paris, Miller met in the street another author, Robert W. Service, who recalled the story in his autobiography: "Soon we got into conversation which turned to books. For a stripling he spoke with some authority, turning into ridicule the pretentious scribes of the Latin Quarter and their freak magazine."[25] In 1930, Miller moved to Paris unaccompanied.[26] Soon after, he began work on Tropic of Cancer, writing to a friend, "I start tomorrow on the Paris book: First person, uncensored, formless - fuck everything!"[27] Although Miller had little or no money the first year in Paris, things began to change with the meeting of Anaïs Nin who, with Hugh Guiler, went on to pay his entire way through the 1930s including the rent for an apartment at 18 Villa Seurat. Nin became his lover and financed the first printing of Tropic of Cancer in 1934 with money from Otto Rank.[28] She would write extensively in her journals about her relationship with Miller and his wife June; the first volume, covering the years 1931-34, was published in 1966.[26] Late in 1934, June divorced Miller by proxy in Mexico City.[29]
In 1931, Miller was employed by the Chicago Tribune Paris edition, thanks to his friend Alfred Perlès who worked there, as a proofreader. Miller took this opportunity to submit some of his own articles under Perlès' name, since at that time only the editorial staff were permitted to publish in the paper. This period in Paris was highly creative for Miller, and during this time he also established a significant and influential network of authors circulating around the Villa Seurat.[30] At that time a young British author, Lawrence Durrell, became a lifelong friend. Miller's correspondence with Durrell was later published in two books.[31][32] During his Paris period he was also influenced by the French Surrealists.
His works contain detailed accounts of sexual experiences. His first published book, Tropic of Cancer (1934), was published by Obelisk Press in Paris and banned in the United States on the grounds of obscenity.[33] The dust jacket came wrapped with a warning: "Not to be imported into the United States or Great Britain."[34] He continued to write novels that were banned; along with Tropic of Cancer, his Black Spring (1936) and Tropic of Capricorn (1939) were smuggled into his native country, building Miller an underground reputation. While the aforementioned novels remained banned in the US for over two decades, in 1939, New Directions published The Cosmological Eye, Miller's first book to be published in America. The collection contained short prose pieces, most of which originally appeared in Black Spring and Max and the White Phagocytes (1938).[35]
Miller lived in France until June 1939.[36]
Greece, 1939–40[edit]
In 1939 Durrell, who lived in Corfu, invited Miller to Greece. Miller described the visit in The Colossus of Maroussi (1941), which he considered his best book.[19] One of the first acknowledgments of Henry Miller as a major modern writer was by George Orwell in his 1940 essay "Inside the Whale", where he wrote:

Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose-writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.[37]

California, 1942–80[edit]

In 1940, Miller returned to New York; after a year-long trip around the United States, a journey that would become material for The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, he moved to California in June 1942, initially residing just outside Hollywood in Beverly Glen, before settling in Big Sur in 1944.[36] While Miller was establishing his base in Big Sur, the Tropic books, then still banned in the USA,[38] were being published in France by the Obelisk Press and later the Olympia Press. There they were acquiring a slow and steady notoriety among both Europeans and the various enclaves of American cultural exiles. As a result, the books were frequently smuggled into the States, where they proved to be a major influence on the new Beat Generation of American writers, most notably Jack Kerouac, the only Beat writer Miller truly cared for.[39] By the time his banned books were published in the 1960s and he was becoming increasingly well-known, Miller was no longer interested in his image as an outlaw writer of smut-filled books; however, he eventually gave up fighting the image.[40]
In 1942, shortly before moving to California, Miller began writing Sexus, the first novel in The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period of his life in Brooklyn falling in love with June and struggling to become a writer.[41] Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan.[42] In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in Sunday After The War (1944) and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (1945). His Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, published in 1957, is a collection of stories about his life and friends in Big Sur.[43]
In 1944, Miller met and married his third wife, Janina Martha Lepska, a philosophy student who was 30 years his junior.[26] They had two children: a son, Tony, and a daughter, Valentine.[44] They divorced in 1952. The following year, he married artist Eve McClure, who was 37 years his junior. They divorced in 1960,[26] and she died in 1966, likely as a result of alcoholism.[45] In 1961, Miller arranged a reunion in New York with his ex-wife and main subject of The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, June. They hadn't seen each other in nearly three decades. In a letter to Eve, he described his shock at June's "terrible" appearance, as she had by then degenerated both physically and mentally.[46]
In February 1963, Miller moved to 444 Ocampo Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, where he would spend the last 17 years of his life.[47] In 1967, Miller married his fifth wife, Hoki Tokuda.[48][49] In 1968, Miller signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.[50] After his move to Ocampo Drive, he held dinner parties for the artistic and literary figures of the time. His cook and caretaker was a young artist's model named Twinka Thiebaud who later wrote a book about his evening chats.[51] Thiebaud's memories of Miller's table talk were published in a rewritten and retitled book in 2011.[52]
Only 200 copies of Miller's 1972 chapbook On Turning Eighty were published. Published by Capra Press, in collaboration with Yes! Press, it was the first volume of the "Yes! Capra" chapbook series and is 34 pages in length.[53] The book contains three essays on topics such as aging and living a meaningful life. In relation to reaching 80 years of age, Miller explains:

If at eighty you’re not a cripple or an invalid, if you have your health, if you still enjoy a good walk, a good meal (with all the trimmings), if you can sleep without first taking a pill, if birds and flowers, mountains and sea still inspire you, you are a most fortunate individual and you should get down on your knees morning and night and thank the good Lord for his savin’ and keepin’ power.[54]

Late in life, Miller filmed with Warren Beatty for the 1981 film Reds, which was also directed by Beatty. He spoke of his remembrances of John Reed and Louise Bryant as part of a series of "witnesses." The film was released eighteen months after Miller's death.[55] During the last four years of his life, Miller held an ongoing correspondence of over 1,500 letters with Brenda Venus, a young Playboy playmate, actress and dancer. A book about their correspondence was published in 1986.[56]
Death[edit]
Miller died of circulatory complications at his home in Pacific Palisades on June 7, 1980, at the age of 88.[57] His body was cremated and his ashes shared between his son Tony and daughter Val. Tony has stated that he ultimately intends to have his ashes mixed with those of his father and scattered in Big Sur.[58]
US publication of previously banned works[edit]
The publication of Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press led to a series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein, citing Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature; it was one of the notable events in what has come to be known as the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published.[59] Following the trial, in 1964–65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: Black Spring, Tropic of Capricorn, Quiet Days in Clichy, Sexus, Plexus and Nexus.[60] Excerpts from some of these banned books, including Tropic of Cancer, Black Spring and Sexus, were first published in the US by New Directions in The Henry Miller Reader in 1959.[61][62]
Watercolors[edit]
In addition to his literary abilities, Miller produced numerous watercolor paintings and wrote books on this field. He was a close friend of the French painter Grégoire Michonze. It is estimated that Miller painted 2,000 watercolors during his life, and that 50 or more major collections of Miller’s paintings exist.[63] The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a selection of Miller's watercolors,[64] as did the Henry Miller Museum of Art in Ōmachi City in Nagano, Japan, before closing in 2001.[65] Miller's daughter Valentine placed some of her father's art for sale in 2005.[66] He was also an amateur pianist.[67]
Literary archives[edit]
Miller's papers can be found in the following library special collections:

Southern Illinois University Carbondale, which has correspondence and other archival collections.[68]
Syracuse University, which holds a portion of the correspondence between the Grove Press and Henry Miller.[69]
Charles E. Young Research Library of the University of California, Los Angeles Library.[70]
Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, which has materials about Miller from his first wife and their daughter.[71]
University of Victoria, which holds a significant collection of Miller's manuscripts and correspondence, including the corrected typescripts for Max and Quiet Days in Clichy, as well as Miller's lengthy correspondence with Alfred Perlès.[72]
University of Virginia.[73]
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University Library.[74]
University of Pennsylvania Libraries, Philadelphia, PA.[75]

Miller's friend Emil White founded the nonprofit Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur in 1981.[76] This houses a collection of his works and celebrates his literary, artistic and cultural legacy by providing a public gallery as well as performance and workshop spaces for artists, musicians, students, and writers.[76]
Literary references[edit]
Miller is considered a "literary innovator" in whose works "actual and imagined experiences became indistinguishable from each other."[77] His books did much to free the discussion of sexual subjects in American writing from both legal and social restrictions. He influenced many writers, including Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Theroux and Erica Jong.[34]
Throughout his novels he makes references to literature; he cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Balzac and Nietzsche as having a formative impact on him.[78]
Tropic of Cancer is referenced in Junot Díaz's 2007 book The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao as being read by Ana Obregón. Miller's legal difficulties, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn are mentioned in Denis Johnson's 2007 novel Tree of Smoke, in a conversation between Skip Sands and his uncle, Colonel Sands. Miller is mentioned again later in the novel.[79]

Films[edit]
Miller as himself[edit]
Miller appeared as himself in several films:[80]

He was the subject of four documentary films by Robert Snyder; The Henry Miller Odyssey (90 minutes), Henry Miller: Reflections On Writing (47 minutes), and Henry Miller Reads and Muses (60 minutes). In addition, there is a film by Snyder that was completed after Snyder's death in 2004 about Miller's watercolor paintings, Henry Miller: To Paint Is To Love Again (60 minutes). All four films are in Miller's own words.
He was a "witness" (interviewee) in Warren Beatty's 1981 film Reds.[81]
He was featured in the 1996 documentary Henry Miller Is Not Dead that featured music by Laurie Anderson.[82]

Actors portraying Miller[edit]
Several actors played Miller on film, such as:

Rip Torn in the 1970 film adaptation of Tropic of Cancer.
In the 1970 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy, the Miller-based character of 'Joey' was played by Paul Valjean.
Fred Ward in the 1990 film Henry & June, based on the diaries of Anaïs Nin.
David Brandon in the 1990 film The Room of Words (La Stanza Delle Parole), also based on Nin's diaries.
Claude Chabrol's 1990 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy saw Andrew McCarthy play Miller.

Signature



Henry Valentine Miller (December 26, 1891 – June 7, 1980) was an American writer, expatriated in Paris at his flourishing. He was known for breaking with existing literary forms, developing a new sort of semi-autobiographical novel that blended character study, social criticism, philosophical reflection, explicit language, sex, surrealist free association, and mysticism.[1][2] His most characteristic works of this kind are Tropic of Capricorn, The Colossus of Maroussi, The Time of the Assassins, and The Books in My Life, many of which are based on his experiences in New York and Paris (some of which were banned in the United States until 1961), adding Big Sur and the Oranges of Heronymous Bosch while finally residing in Big Sur, California.[3] He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism, and painted watercolors.[4]

Early life[edit]
Miller was born at his family's home, 450 East 85th Street, in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, New York City. He was the son of Lutheran German parents, Louise Marie (Neiting) and tailor Heinrich Miller.[5] As a child, he lived for nine years at 662 Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,[6] known at that time (and referred to frequently in his works) as the Fourteenth Ward. In 1900, his family moved to 1063 Decatur Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.[7] After finishing elementary school, although his family remained in Bushwick, Miller attended Eastern District High School in Williamsburg.[8] As a young man, he was active with the Socialist Party of America (his "quondam idol" was the black Socialist Hubert Harrison).[9] He attended the City College of New York for one semester.[10]
Career[edit]
Brooklyn, 1917–30[edit]
Miller married his first wife, Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, in 1917;[11] their divorce was granted on December 21, 1923.[12] Together they had a daughter, Barbara, born in 1919.[13] They lived in an apartment at 244 6th Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn.[14] At the time, Miller was working at Western Union; he worked there from 1920-24. In March 1922, during a three-week vacation, he wrote his first novel, Clipped Wings. It has never been published, and only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in other works, such as Tropic of Capricorn.[15] A study of twelve Western Union messengers, Miller called Clipped Wings "a long book and probably a very bad one."[16]
In 1923, while he was still married to Beatrice, Miller met and became enamored of a mysterious dance hall dancer who was born Juliet Edith Smerth but went by the stage name June Mansfield. She was 21 at the time.[17] They began an affair, and were married on June 1, 1924.[18] In 1924 Miller quit Western Union in order to dedicate himself completely to writing.[19] Miller later describes this time – his struggles to become a writer, his sexual escapades, failures, friends, and philosophy – in his autobiographical trilogy The Rosy Crucifixion.
Miller's second novel, Moloch: or, This Gentile World, was written in 1927–28, initially under the guise of a novel written by June.[20] A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it was hers.[21] The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death.[20] Moloch is based on Miller’s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan.[22] A third novel written around this time, Crazy Cock, also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled Lovely Lesbians, Crazy Cock (along with his later novel Nexus) told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later.[23] Kronski committed suicide around 1930.[24]
Paris, 1930–39[edit]
In 1928, Miller spent several months in Paris with June, a trip which was financed by Freedman.[22] One day in Paris, Miller met in the street another author, Robert W. Service, who recalled the story in his autobiography: "Soon we got into conversation which turned to books. For a stripling he spoke with some authority, turning into ridicule the pretentious scribes of the Latin Quarter and their freak magazine."[25] In 1930, Miller moved to Paris unaccompanied.[26] Soon after, he began work on Tropic of Cancer, writing to a friend, "I start tomorrow on the Paris book: First person, uncensored, formless - fuck everything!"[27] Although Miller had little or no money the first year in Paris, things began to change with the meeting of Anaïs Nin who, with Hugh Guiler, went on to pay his entire way through the 1930s including the rent for an apartment at 18 Villa Seurat. Nin became his lover and financed the first printing of Tropic of Cancer in 1934 with money from Otto Rank.[28] She would write extensively in her journals about her relationship with Miller and his wife June; the first volume, covering the years 1931-34, was published in 1966.[26] Late in 1934, June divorced Miller by proxy in Mexico City.[29]
In 1931, Miller was employed by the Chicago Tribune Paris edition, thanks to his friend Alfred Perlès who worked there, as a proofreader. Miller took this opportunity to submit some of his own articles under Perlès' name, since at that time only the editorial staff were permitted to publish in the paper. This period in Paris was highly creative for Miller, and during this time he also established a significant and influential network of authors circulating around the Villa Seurat.[30] At that time a young British author, Lawrence Durrell, became a lifelong friend. Miller's correspondence with Durrell was later published in two books.[31][32] During his Paris period he was also influenced by the French Surrealists.
His works contain detailed accounts of sexual experiences. His first published book, Tropic of Cancer (1934), was published by Obelisk Press in Paris and banned in the United States on the grounds of obscenity.[33] The dust jacket came wrapped with a warning: "Not to be imported into the United States or Great Britain."[34] He continued to write novels that were banned; along with Tropic of Cancer, his Black Spring (1936) and Tropic of Capricorn (1939) were smuggled into his native country, building Miller an underground reputation. While the aforementioned novels remained banned in the US for over two decades, in 1939, New Directions published The Cosmological Eye, Miller's first book to be published in America. The collection contained short prose pieces, most of which originally appeared in Black Spring and Max and the White Phagocytes (1938).[35]
Miller lived in France until June 1939.[36]
Greece, 1939–40[edit]
In 1939 Durrell, who lived in Corfu, invited Miller to Greece. Miller described the visit in The Colossus of Maroussi (1941), which he considered his best book.[19] One of the first acknowledgments of Henry Miller as a major modern writer was by George Orwell in his 1940 essay "Inside the Whale", where he wrote:

Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose-writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.[37]

California, 1942–80[edit]

In 1940, Miller returned to New York; after a year-long trip around the United States, a journey that would become material for The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, he moved to California in June 1942, initially residing just outside Hollywood in Beverly Glen, before settling in Big Sur in 1944.[36] While Miller was establishing his base in Big Sur, the Tropic books, then still banned in the USA,[38] were being published in France by the Obelisk Press and later the Olympia Press. There they were acquiring a slow and steady notoriety among both Europeans and the various enclaves of American cultural exiles. As a result, the books were frequently smuggled into the States, where they proved to be a major influence on the new Beat Generation of American writers, most notably Jack Kerouac, the only Beat writer Miller truly cared for.[39] By the time his banned books were published in the 1960s and he was becoming increasingly well-known, Miller was no longer interested in his image as an outlaw writer of smut-filled books; however, he eventually gave up fighting the image.[40]
In 1942, shortly before moving to California, Miller began writing Sexus, the first novel in The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period of his life in Brooklyn falling in love with June and struggling to become a writer.[41] Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan.[42] In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in Sunday After The War (1944) and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (1945). His Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, published in 1957, is a collection of stories about his life and friends in Big Sur.[43]
In 1944, Miller met and married his third wife, Janina Martha Lepska, a philosophy student who was 30 years his junior.[26] They had two children: a son, Tony, and a daughter, Valentine.[44] They divorced in 1952. The following year, he married artist Eve McClure, who was 37 years his junior. They divorced in 1960,[26] and she died in 1966, likely as a result of alcoholism.[45] In 1961, Miller arranged a reunion in New York with his ex-wife and main subject of The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, June. They hadn't seen each other in nearly three decades. In a letter to Eve, he described his shock at June's "terrible" appearance, as she had by then degenerated both physically and mentally.[46]
In February 1963, Miller moved to 444 Ocampo Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, where he would spend the last 17 years of his life.[47] In 1967, Miller married his fifth wife, Hoki Tokuda.[48][49] In 1968, Miller signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.[50] After his move to Ocampo Drive, he held dinner parties for the artistic and literary figures of the time. His cook and caretaker was a young artist's model named Twinka Thiebaud who later wrote a book about his evening chats.[51] Thiebaud's memories of Miller's table talk were published in a rewritten and retitled book in 2011.[52]
Only 200 copies of Miller's 1972 chapbook On Turning Eighty were published. Published by Capra Press, in collaboration with Yes! Press, it was the first volume of the "Yes! Capra" chapbook series and is 34 pages in length.[53] The book contains three essays on topics such as aging and living a meaningful life. In relation to reaching 80 years of age, Miller explains:

If at eighty you’re not a cripple or an invalid, if you have your health, if you still enjoy a good walk, a good meal (with all the trimmings), if you can sleep without first taking a pill, if birds and flowers, mountains and sea still inspire you, you are a most fortunate individual and you should get down on your knees morning and night and thank the good Lord for his savin’ and keepin’ power.[54]

Late in life, Miller filmed with Warren Beatty for the 1981 film Reds, which was also directed by Beatty. He spoke of his remembrances of John Reed and Louise Bryant as part of a series of "witnesses." The film was released eighteen months after Miller's death.[55] During the last four years of his life, Miller held an ongoing correspondence of over 1,500 letters with Brenda Venus, a young Playboy playmate, actress and dancer. A book about their correspondence was published in 1986.[56]
Death[edit]
Miller died of circulatory complications at his home in Pacific Palisades on June 7, 1980, at the age of 88.[57] His body was cremated and his ashes shared between his son Tony and daughter Val. Tony has stated that he ultimately intends to have his ashes mixed with those of his father and scattered in Big Sur.[58]
US publication of previously banned works[edit]
The publication of Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press led to a series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein, citing Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature; it was one of the notable events in what has come to be known as the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published.[59] Following the trial, in 1964–65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: Black Spring, Tropic of Capricorn, Quiet Days in Clichy, Sexus, Plexus and Nexus.[60] Excerpts from some of these banned books, including Tropic of Cancer, Black Spring and Sexus, were first published in the US by New Directions in The Henry Miller Reader in 1959.[61][62]
Watercolors[edit]
In addition to his literary abilities, Miller produced numerous watercolor paintings and wrote books on this field. He was a close friend of the French painter Grégoire Michonze. It is estimated that Miller painted 2,000 watercolors during his life, and that 50 or more major collections of Miller’s paintings exist.[63] The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a selection of Miller's watercolors,[64] as did the Henry Miller Museum of Art in Ōmachi City in Nagano, Japan, before closing in 2001.[65] Miller's daughter Valentine placed some of her father's art for sale in 2005.[66] He was also an amateur pianist.[67]
Literary archives[edit]
Miller's papers can be found in the following library special collections:

Southern Illinois University Carbondale, which has correspondence and other archival collections.[68]
Syracuse University, which holds a portion of the correspondence between the Grove Press and Henry Miller.[69]
Charles E. Young Research Library of the University of California, Los Angeles Library.[70]
Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, which has materials about Miller from his first wife and their daughter.[71]
University of Victoria, which holds a significant collection of Miller's manuscripts and correspondence, including the corrected typescripts for Max and Quiet Days in Clichy, as well as Miller's lengthy correspondence with Alfred Perlès.[72]
University of Virginia.[73]
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University Library.[74]
University of Pennsylvania Libraries, Philadelphia, PA.[75]

Miller's friend Emil White founded the nonprofit Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur in 1981.[76] This houses a collection of his works and celebrates his literary, artistic and cultural legacy by providing a public gallery as well as performance and workshop spaces for artists, musicians, students, and writers.[76]
Literary references[edit]
Miller is considered a "literary innovator" in whose works "actual and imagined experiences became indistinguishable from each other."[77] His books did much to free the discussion of sexual subjects in American writing from both legal and social restrictions. He influenced many writers, including Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Theroux and Erica Jong.[34]
Throughout his novels he makes references to literature; he cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Balzac and Nietzsche as having a formative impact on him.[78]
Tropic of Cancer is referenced in Junot Díaz's 2007 book The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao as being read by Ana Obregón. Miller's legal difficulties, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn are mentioned in Denis Johnson's 2007 novel Tree of Smoke, in a conversation between Skip Sands and his uncle, Colonel Sands. Miller is mentioned again later in the novel.[79]

Films[edit]
Miller as himself[edit]
Miller appeared as himself in several films:[80]

He was the subject of four documentary films by Robert Snyder; The Henry Miller Odyssey (90 minutes), Henry Miller: Reflections On Writing (47 minutes), and Henry Miller Reads and Muses (60 minutes). In addition, there is a film by Snyder that was completed after Snyder's death in 2004 about Miller's watercolor paintings, Henry Miller: To Paint Is To Love Again (60 minutes). All four films are in Miller's own words.
He was a "witness" (interviewee) in Warren Beatty's 1981 film Reds.[81]
He was featured in the 1996 documentary Henry Miller Is Not Dead that featured music by Laurie Anderson.[82]

Actors portraying Miller[edit]
Several actors played Miller on film, such as:

Rip Torn in the 1970 film adaptation of Tropic of Cancer.
In the 1970 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy, the Miller-based character of 'Joey' was played by Paul Valjean.
Fred Ward in the 1990 film Henry & June, based on the diaries of Anaïs Nin.
David Brandon in the 1990 film The Room of Words (La Stanza Delle Parole), also based on Nin's diaries.
Claude Chabrol's 1990 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy saw Andrew McCarthy play Miller.

Signature



Henry Valentine Miller (December 26, 1891 – June 7, 1980) was an American writer, expatriated in Paris at his flourishing. He was known for breaking with existing literary forms, developing a new sort of semi-autobiographical novel that blended character study, social criticism, philosophical reflection, explicit language, sex, surrealist free association, and mysticism.[1][2] His most characteristic works of this kind are Tropic of Capricorn, The Colossus of Maroussi, The Time of the Assassins, and The Books in My Life, many of which are based on his experiences in New York and Paris (some of which were banned in the United States until 1961), adding Big Sur and the Oranges of Heronymous Bosch while finally residing in Big Sur, California.[3] He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism, and painted watercolors.[4]

Early life[edit]
Miller was born at his family's home, 450 East 85th Street, in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, New York City. He was the son of Lutheran German parents, Louise Marie (Neiting) and tailor Heinrich Miller.[5] As a child, he lived for nine years at 662 Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,[6] known at that time (and referred to frequently in his works) as the Fourteenth Ward. In 1900, his family moved to 1063 Decatur Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.[7] After finishing elementary school, although his family remained in Bushwick, Miller attended Eastern District High School in Williamsburg.[8] As a young man, he was active with the Socialist Party of America (his "quondam idol" was the black Socialist Hubert Harrison).[9] He attended the City College of New York for one semester.[10]
Career[edit]
Brooklyn, 1917–30[edit]
Miller married his first wife, Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, in 1917;[11] their divorce was granted on December 21, 1923.[12] Together they had a daughter, Barbara, born in 1919.[13] They lived in an apartment at 244 6th Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn.[14] At the time, Miller was working at Western Union; he worked there from 1920-24. In March 1922, during a three-week vacation, he wrote his first novel, Clipped Wings. It has never been published, and only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in other works, such as Tropic of Capricorn.[15] A study of twelve Western Union messengers, Miller called Clipped Wings "a long book and probably a very bad one."[16]
In 1923, while he was still married to Beatrice, Miller met and became enamored of a mysterious dance hall dancer who was born Juliet Edith Smerth but went by the stage name June Mansfield. She was 21 at the time.[17] They began an affair, and were married on June 1, 1924.[18] In 1924 Miller quit Western Union in order to dedicate himself completely to writing.[19] Miller later describes this time – his struggles to become a writer, his sexual escapades, failures, friends, and philosophy – in his autobiographical trilogy The Rosy Crucifixion.
Miller's second novel, Moloch: or, This Gentile World, was written in 1927–28, initially under the guise of a novel written by June.[20] A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it was hers.[21] The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death.[20] Moloch is based on Miller’s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan.[22] A third novel written around this time, Crazy Cock, also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled Lovely Lesbians, Crazy Cock (along with his later novel Nexus) told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later.[23] Kronski committed suicide around 1930.[24]
Paris, 1930–39[edit]
In 1928, Miller spent several months in Paris with June, a trip which was financed by Freedman.[22] One day in Paris, Miller met in the street another author, Robert W. Service, who recalled the story in his autobiography: "Soon we got into conversation which turned to books. For a stripling he spoke with some authority, turning into ridicule the pretentious scribes of the Latin Quarter and their freak magazine."[25] In 1930, Miller moved to Paris unaccompanied.[26] Soon after, he began work on Tropic of Cancer, writing to a friend, "I start tomorrow on the Paris book: First person, uncensored, formless - fuck everything!"[27] Although Miller had little or no money the first year in Paris, things began to change with the meeting of Anaïs Nin who, with Hugh Guiler, went on to pay his entire way through the 1930s including the rent for an apartment at 18 Villa Seurat. Nin became his lover and financed the first printing of Tropic of Cancer in 1934 with money from Otto Rank.[28] She would write extensively in her journals about her relationship with Miller and his wife June; the first volume, covering the years 1931-34, was published in 1966.[26] Late in 1934, June divorced Miller by proxy in Mexico City.[29]
In 1931, Miller was employed by the Chicago Tribune Paris edition, thanks to his friend Alfred Perlès who worked there, as a proofreader. Miller took this opportunity to submit some of his own articles under Perlès' name, since at that time only the editorial staff were permitted to publish in the paper. This period in Paris was highly creative for Miller, and during this time he also established a significant and influential network of authors circulating around the Villa Seurat.[30] At that time a young British author, Lawrence Durrell, became a lifelong friend. Miller's correspondence with Durrell was later published in two books.[31][32] During his Paris period he was also influenced by the French Surrealists.
His works contain detailed accounts of sexual experiences. His first published book, Tropic of Cancer (1934), was published by Obelisk Press in Paris and banned in the United States on the grounds of obscenity.[33] The dust jacket came wrapped with a warning: "Not to be imported into the United States or Great Britain."[34] He continued to write novels that were banned; along with Tropic of Cancer, his Black Spring (1936) and Tropic of Capricorn (1939) were smuggled into his native country, building Miller an underground reputation. While the aforementioned novels remained banned in the US for over two decades, in 1939, New Directions published The Cosmological Eye, Miller's first book to be published in America. The collection contained short prose pieces, most of which originally appeared in Black Spring and Max and the White Phagocytes (1938).[35]
Miller lived in France until June 1939.[36]
Greece, 1939–40[edit]
In 1939 Durrell, who lived in Corfu, invited Miller to Greece. Miller described the visit in The Colossus of Maroussi (1941), which he considered his best book.[19] One of the first acknowledgments of Henry Miller as a major modern writer was by George Orwell in his 1940 essay "Inside the Whale", where he wrote:

Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose-writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.[37]

California, 1942–80[edit]

In 1940, Miller returned to New York; after a year-long trip around the United States, a journey that would become material for The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, he moved to California in June 1942, initially residing just outside Hollywood in Beverly Glen, before settling in Big Sur in 1944.[36] While Miller was establishing his base in Big Sur, the Tropic books, then still banned in the USA,[38] were being published in France by the Obelisk Press and later the Olympia Press. There they were acquiring a slow and steady notoriety among both Europeans and the various enclaves of American cultural exiles. As a result, the books were frequently smuggled into the States, where they proved to be a major influence on the new Beat Generation of American writers, most notably Jack Kerouac, the only Beat writer Miller truly cared for.[39] By the time his banned books were published in the 1960s and he was becoming increasingly well-known, Miller was no longer interested in his image as an outlaw writer of smut-filled books; however, he eventually gave up fighting the image.[40]
In 1942, shortly before moving to California, Miller began writing Sexus, the first novel in The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period of his life in Brooklyn falling in love with June and struggling to become a writer.[41] Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan.[42] In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in Sunday After The War (1944) and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (1945). His Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, published in 1957, is a collection of stories about his life and friends in Big Sur.[43]
In 1944, Miller met and married his third wife, Janina Martha Lepska, a philosophy student who was 30 years his junior.[26] They had two children: a son, Tony, and a daughter, Valentine.[44] They divorced in 1952. The following year, he married artist Eve McClure, who was 37 years his junior. They divorced in 1960,[26] and she died in 1966, likely as a result of alcoholism.[45] In 1961, Miller arranged a reunion in New York with his ex-wife and main subject of The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, June. They hadn't seen each other in nearly three decades. In a letter to Eve, he described his shock at June's "terrible" appearance, as she had by then degenerated both physically and mentally.[46]
In February 1963, Miller moved to 444 Ocampo Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, where he would spend the last 17 years of his life.[47] In 1967, Miller married his fifth wife, Hoki Tokuda.[48][49] In 1968, Miller signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.[50] After his move to Ocampo Drive, he held dinner parties for the artistic and literary figures of the time. His cook and caretaker was a young artist's model named Twinka Thiebaud who later wrote a book about his evening chats.[51] Thiebaud's memories of Miller's table talk were published in a rewritten and retitled book in 2011.[52]
Only 200 copies of Miller's 1972 chapbook On Turning Eighty were published. Published by Capra Press, in collaboration with Yes! Press, it was the first volume of the "Yes! Capra" chapbook series and is 34 pages in length.[53] The book contains three essays on topics such as aging and living a meaningful life. In relation to reaching 80 years of age, Miller explains:

If at eighty you’re not a cripple or an invalid, if you have your health, if you still enjoy a good walk, a good meal (with all the trimmings), if you can sleep without first taking a pill, if birds and flowers, mountains and sea still inspire you, you are a most fortunate individual and you should get down on your knees morning and night and thank the good Lord for his savin’ and keepin’ power.[54]

Late in life, Miller filmed with Warren Beatty for the 1981 film Reds, which was also directed by Beatty. He spoke of his remembrances of John Reed and Louise Bryant as part of a series of "witnesses." The film was released eighteen months after Miller's death.[55] During the last four years of his life, Miller held an ongoing correspondence of over 1,500 letters with Brenda Venus, a young Playboy playmate, actress and dancer. A book about their correspondence was published in 1986.[56]
Death[edit]
Miller died of circulatory complications at his home in Pacific Palisades on June 7, 1980, at the age of 88.[57] His body was cremated and his ashes shared between his son Tony and daughter Val. Tony has stated that he ultimately intends to have his ashes mixed with those of his father and scattered in Big Sur.[58]
US publication of previously banned works[edit]
The publication of Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press led to a series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein, citing Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature; it was one of the notable events in what has come to be known as the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published.[59] Following the trial, in 1964–65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: Black Spring, Tropic of Capricorn, Quiet Days in Clichy, Sexus, Plexus and Nexus.[60] Excerpts from some of these banned books, including Tropic of Cancer, Black Spring and Sexus, were first published in the US by New Directions in The Henry Miller Reader in 1959.[61][62]
Watercolors[edit]
In addition to his literary abilities, Miller produced numerous watercolor paintings and wrote books on this field. He was a close friend of the French painter Grégoire Michonze. It is estimated that Miller painted 2,000 watercolors during his life, and that 50 or more major collections of Miller’s paintings exist.[63] The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a selection of Miller's watercolors,[64] as did the Henry Miller Museum of Art in Ōmachi City in Nagano, Japan, before closing in 2001.[65] Miller's daughter Valentine placed some of her father's art for sale in 2005.[66] He was also an amateur pianist.[67]
Literary archives[edit]
Miller's papers can be found in the following library special collections:

Southern Illinois University Carbondale, which has correspondence and other archival collections.[68]
Syracuse University, which holds a portion of the correspondence between the Grove Press and Henry Miller.[69]
Charles E. Young Research Library of the University of California, Los Angeles Library.[70]
Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, which has materials about Miller from his first wife and their daughter.[71]
University of Victoria, which holds a significant collection of Miller's manuscripts and correspondence, including the corrected typescripts for Max and Quiet Days in Clichy, as well as Miller's lengthy correspondence with Alfred Perlès.[72]
University of Virginia.[73]
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University Library.[74]
University of Pennsylvania Libraries, Philadelphia, PA.[75]

Miller's friend Emil White founded the nonprofit Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur in 1981.[76] This houses a collection of his works and celebrates his literary, artistic and cultural legacy by providing a public gallery as well as performance and workshop spaces for artists, musicians, students, and writers.[76]
Literary references[edit]
Miller is considered a "literary innovator" in whose works "actual and imagined experiences became indistinguishable from each other."[77] His books did much to free the discussion of sexual subjects in American writing from both legal and social restrictions. He influenced many writers, including Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Theroux and Erica Jong.[34]
Throughout his novels he makes references to literature; he cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Balzac and Nietzsche as having a formative impact on him.[78]
Tropic of Cancer is referenced in Junot Díaz's 2007 book The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao as being read by Ana Obregón. Miller's legal difficulties, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn are mentioned in Denis Johnson's 2007 novel Tree of Smoke, in a conversation between Skip Sands and his uncle, Colonel Sands. Miller is mentioned again later in the novel.[79]

Films[edit]
Miller as himself[edit]
Miller appeared as himself in several films:[80]

He was the subject of four documentary films by Robert Snyder; The Henry Miller Odyssey (90 minutes), Henry Miller: Reflections On Writing (47 minutes), and Henry Miller Reads and Muses (60 minutes). In addition, there is a film by Snyder that was completed after Snyder's death in 2004 about Miller's watercolor paintings, Henry Miller: To Paint Is To Love Again (60 minutes). All four films are in Miller's own words.
He was a "witness" (interviewee) in Warren Beatty's 1981 film Reds.[81]
He was featured in the 1996 documentary Henry Miller Is Not Dead that featured music by Laurie Anderson.[82]

Actors portraying Miller[edit]
Several actors played Miller on film, such as:

Rip Torn in the 1970 film adaptation of Tropic of Cancer.
In the 1970 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy, the Miller-based character of 'Joey' was played by Paul Valjean.
Fred Ward in the 1990 film Henry & June, based on the diaries of Anaïs Nin.
David Brandon in the 1990 film The Room of Words (La Stanza Delle Parole), also based on Nin's diaries.
Claude Chabrol's 1990 adaptation of Quiet Days in Clichy saw Andrew McCarthy play Miller.

All About Liquor

Unless you're lining up a bunch of shots, liquor takes a little more work than cracking a beer or pouring a glass of wine. However, the effort is well worth the result if you've picked up the right bottle. Enjoy the sophisticated complexity of whiskey all on its own or create an amazing gin cocktail. Impress your guests with a digestif or get the party started with a batch of margaritas. You can find a different liquor brand or cocktail to suit every occasion. Plus, being able to whip up a delicious cocktail will never not impress your guests.
Whiskey:
With a diverse array of flavors, you can try a different whiskey or bourbon every night and never get bored. It tastes great straight from the glass, though you can dress it up with flavored soda, sparkling water or other mixers. Try light and dark whiskeys to experience the full spectrum of notes, from fruity and light to bitter, spicy and dark.
Vodka:
Although higher-end vodka can taste wonderful straight from the shot glass or tumbler, it's perfect for cocktails. When you crave spicy, whip up a batch of bloody marys — and don't skimp on the hot sauce. A vodka martini tastes great with a few olives, while a Cosmopolitan will satisfy anyone with a sweet tooth and a penchant for "Sex and the City" marathons.
Tequila:
It's best known for its inclusion in popular cocktails, from margaritas and tequila sunrises to Joan Collinses and tequila sours. It's also perfect as an apéritif when mixed with simple tonic. Choose a lighter-colored tequila for this cocktail, and don't forget to add plenty of crushed ice.
Brandy:
If you want to impress someone, keep a bottle of good brandy on hand. It's best served neat in a well-rounded snifter, though a simple tumbler works too. To experience the full array of rich flavors, hold the glass between your hands to warm the liquid inside. Like wine, brandy often tastes best after you take a good whif, so don't forget to sniff before you lift the glass to your lips.
Gin:
This humble liquor has been popular for centuries thanks to its fairly simple taste. If you're planning a party, collect the recipe ingredients necessary for gin martinis, gimlets, Tom Collinses, and Singapore slings. Of course, it also tastes great with a splash of soda on the rocks.
Start searching around to buy liquor online, whether it's a fancy bottle to impress your in-laws or some mini liquor bottles to take on your next flight.

All About Wine

Whether you're dedicated to your signature wines or you're looking for a new bottle that'll blow your mind, you'll find all the wine you've ever dreamed of right here. Find out why we consider ourselves a wine lover's paradise and discover why Drizly is the best place to shop for everything from your everyday table wine to your special occasion bottles.
Red Wines:
If you can't tell a Syrah from a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Rioja from a Bordeaux, there still might be hope for you yet. Discover the cherry and cassis notes in a great bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon or start sipping an easy-to-drink Merlot. But don't just stay in the Old World — go beyond just France and try some of our bestselling bottles of Australian Shiraz, Argentinian Malbec and Spanish Rioja.
White Wines:
If you've never met a glass of white wine you didn't love, start sipping your way through our vast selection to find your new fave. From full-bodied Chardonnay to crisp Riesling to refreshing Pinot Grigio, we have the perfect bottle so you can make your own happy hour. Try bottles of Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand or South Africa, Chardonnay from California or Australia or Gewürztraminer from Germany or France. You'll totally feel like a world traveler just from your couch!
Sparkling Wines:
Whether you're celebrating an anniversary, a major milestone at work or just the end of a great day, you need the perfect sparkling wine. For the uninitiated, bubbly goes way beyond Champagne. Sure, this French varietal is the most famous type of sparkling wine. But if you'd rather try a pleasant Prosecco or a Catalonian Cava, we have just the bottle of bubbly for you. A popped cork makes your day more poppin'. True story.
Rosé Wines:
On a warm summer day, nothing hits the spot like a glass of rosé. Don't be scared off by the color — real heroes love pink. Try a dry, full-bodied bottle from Côtes de Provence and feel like you're that much closer to your dream of horseback riding through the French countryside. Or save a bottle of sparkling rosé for when you really need your special occasion to stand out from all those other basic bubblies.
Dessert Wines:
The next time you want to finish your meal with a little something sweet, skip that crème brûlée and go for a glass of dessert wine instead. Know you're the classiest person around with a glass of Port and Sherry, or sweeten the deal with our extensive selection of Amontillado or yes, even Vermouth.

All About Beer

It's good to have beers around. In the fridge. At the office. In the cooler. Not so much in the car. But almost everywhere else. It's like a comfort blanket for adults. And there are so many different beer types, you'll never get bored. Fancy beers, cheap beers, flavorful beers, light beers—they've all got their time and place. That place mostly being in our hearts.
Top Trending Styles of Beer:
IPA:
If you dig hops, India Pale Ale is your beer. Legend says British brewers packed extra hops into beer before the long voyage to India. Is it true? Who cares? Drink it. IPAs vary from a gentle hop handshake to a sock in the eye. Dry-hopped versions are made from preserved hops and are sharper. Fresh/wet hopped brews are made right after harvest, featuring a more floral nose and hints of apricot.
Lager:
The classic golden brew from bottom-fermenting yeast is typically clean and light in flavor. Clarity is its trademark, but some include dark caramelized malt that produces a black lager mellower than porter or stout. Rare India Pale Lagers feature big hop aromas but finish softer than their ale cousins. However, most lagers are easy-drinking fishing brews that defy beer snobbery, pair nicely with each other and are served best in a cooler full of ice.
Cider:
While cider is jumping out of nowhere in the U.S., it's always been big in the UK, which is the world's biggest cider consumer. They can be made from any kind of apple, and even pears, but high-sugar cider apples are best. They range from crystal clear to murky and brown. Most sparkle, but some are still. Cider is a good choice for those concerned about wheat. Be sure to choose a pure one not blended with ale.
Ale:
"Pale" refers to the color of malt, as opposed to "amber" or "dark." Malt dried slowly without caramelization is pale. The drying process was tough to control centuries ago, so heavily roasted malts were the rule. Now pale malts are easier to make. They produce beers that balance full body and crisp refreshment. Pale ales sparked the American microbrewery revolution of the past couple of decades. Although not born here, pale ales are now as American as hot dogs.
Stout:
The baby born of deeply caramelized malt, stout is dark as a black hole with a full mouthfeel and a head you can chew. They range from creamy/chocolatey/malty to cocoa/espresso/tobacco. While some are as strong as they look with ABV of over 8 percent, others are deceptively light. The most famous stout, Guinness, has less alcohol and fewer calories than most golden brews, making it the perfect lunch beverage. Nitrogenization gives it a velvety texture.
Beer Myths 101:

Cold to warm and back again will skunk beer: Nope. Temperature won't corrupt your beer, but light will. If you're running out of room in the fridge, feel free to remove some beers without worrying. Just don't store them in your trunk during the summer.
Bottles > Cans: Again, nope. We just talked about this. Light is bad for your beer and cans are better at keeping it out. They're also better at keeping oxygen out, which is also no friend of beer.
Stouts are heavy and boozy: Appearances can be deceiving. Stouts might look like a lot to handle, but they're surprisingly light. Guinness actually has less calories and alcohol than Budweiser.
