GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
On June 19, 2007, El Segundo Power II, LLC (El Segundo) filed a petition with the California Energy Commission requesting to amend the Energy Commission Decision to eliminate the use of ocean water as the cooling water source for the El Segundo Power Redevelopment Project (ESPR). The petition proposes a new rapid response combined cycle (R2C2) design that will allow the project to operate without once-through cooling, along with changes to the previously approved laydown/staging areas and access routes. The 630 MW ESPR was originally certified by the Energy Commission at a special Business Meeting on December 23, 2004, but a second Business Meeting to consider errata was held on February 2, 2005. The decision, with errata, was certified on February 2, 2005. A petition challenging the certification was filed with the California Supreme Court shortly thereafter, thus delaying the effective date of the decision. With the Court's denial of the petition on August 31, 2005, the decision became final. The facility is located in the City of El Segundo in Los Angeles County.


Energy Commission Facility Certification Process

The California Energy Commission is the lead agency (for licensing thermal power plants 50 megawatts and larger) under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and has a certified regulatory program under CEQA. 
Under its certified program, the Energy Commission is exempt from having to prepare an environmental impact report. 
Its certified program, however, does require environmental analysis of the project, including an analysis of alternatives and mitigation measures to minimize any significant adverse effect the project may have on the environment.
