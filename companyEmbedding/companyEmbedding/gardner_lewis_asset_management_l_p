 GARDNER LEWIS ASSET Investment Strategy


				
					   ITEM 8: METHOD OF ANALYSIS, INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND Risk of Loss Method of AnalysisGardner Lewis invests in three primary areas: growth equities, hedged equity, and other alternativeinvestments. While each of these has their own unique attributes, all share a common research oriented, bottom-up approach.     - 6 -Growth equity and hedged equity investment ideas are generated in-house by our research analysts. Bottom-up fundamental research is the basis of our stock selection process utilizing direct contact with company management and industry leaders to gain insight into companies. Our investment ideas develop from these contacts. We strive to identify businesses whose fundamentals and earnings growth are not fully reflected in a company’s stock price. Focus is placed on:-     growth rate,-     historic record,-     management expertise,-     financial strength,-     and current valuation. An analys...Get the Full Report

Our History


‘1990’ Centreville, DE

Gardner Lewis Asset Management was founded in April 1990 by W. Whitfield Gardner and John L. Lewis IV.
The firm is rooted in the belief that a “roll-up-the-sleeves” approach to investing is the best way to uncover unrecognized opportunities. Since its inception, the firm has been privately-owned and maintains independence from any outside business affiliations or joint ventures. While client growth and research team depth necessitated a larger working space, Gardner Lewis remains rooted in the Brandywine Valley with its office located in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania.


‘2010’ Chadds Ford, PA

Our firm fosters a team environment to provide the highest level of operational expertise and service to our clients.  From the beginning, Gardner Lewis has valued a distinctive firm culture and has focused on capturing the highest returns through a process that is differentiated and consistent.  We believe these factors are integral to the value we offer our clients.

W. Whitfield Gardner
Portfolio Manager / Partner
Mr. Gardner has served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gardner Lewis Asset Management since the firm’s founding in 1990.  Previously, he was a lead Portfolio Manager with Friess Associates and its Brandywine Fund.  Prior to joining Friess Associates, he worked as an Investment Analyst with Investments Orange Nassau, a Netherlands-based venture capital firm, with interests in both private and public companies.  This position stemmed from employment with MBank, then a $20 billion bank holding company, where he analyzed companies as well as industry groups.  He began his investment career at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb (prior to the Shearson Merger).  Mr. Gardner received his B.B.A. in Finance from Southern Methodist University.

Bernard J. Diggins
Portfolio Manager/Partner
Mr. Diggins has been with the firm since 2000 and oversees research.  Prior to joining Gardner Lewis, Mr. Diggins was in the Corporate and Securities Group of Drinker Biddle & Reath specializing in mergers and acquisitions and venture capital finance. Mr. Diggins received his B.A. from The Ohio State University and was awarded his J.D., Magna Cum Laude, from the Dickinson School of Law at Pennsylvania State University.

Gardner Lewis focuses on transformational change, where fundamental research and risk-advantaged positioning can drive favorable outcomes.
Rigorous fundamental research is the cornerstone of our investment process.
We are rooted in the belief that a "roll-up-the-sleeves" approach to investing is the best way to uncover unrecognized opportunities
Analysts, traders, and portfolio managers working together without compartmentalization fuel original thinking and form the fabric of our firm culture. 

























OUR FIRM


Gardner Lewis Asset Management is a privately-owned investment management firm located outside of Philadelphia, PA.  Since the firm’s inception in 1990, the focus of the investment team has been to seek, identify and invest in compelling opportunities for both institutions and individuals throughout the United States and abroad.








ALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS


CONSISTENT FIRM LEADERSHIP


SINGULAR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY


DISTINCTIVE FIRM CULTURE




Independent firm owned entirely by its investment professionals – unencumbered by distractions associated with larger organizations.
We invest alongside our clients in all that we do.


Leadership has been in place for over 20 years.
Average tenure of senior professionals is more than 15 years.


Gardner Lewis seeks to invest in differentiated opportunity sets where fundamental research and risk-advantaged positioning can drive favorable outcomes.


The Gardner Lewis Culture thrives on intellectual curiosity and teamwork.  Integrated workflow combines with a “roll-up-the-sleeves” approach towards fundamental research to fuel an environment of original thinking.







INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY


Gardner Lewis focuses on transformational change, where fundamental research and risk-advantaged positioning can drive favorable outcomes.








TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE


Companies experiencing a catalyst acting as a force to drive growth or unlock value.


RISK-ADVANTAGED


We seek investment opportunities with attractive upside potential and limited or muted downside risk.










RESEARCH


Since the firm’s inception, Gardner Lewis has been dedicated to fundamentally researched investing.  We believe that fundamental work uncovers opportunity and identifies risk.











FUNDAMENTAL


In-depth work driven by the bottom-up analysis of each opportunity.  The potential of each idea is evaluated from a financial and strategic perspective and the thesis is scrutinized rigorously before and during each investment.







INTEGRATED APPROACH


We  believe in traders, analysts, and portfolio managers working together without compartmentalization.  Our integrated “team” philosophy fuels original thinking.







VARIANT PERCEPTION


What is it that we understand about this opportunity that differs from the consensus view?







INVESTMENT STRATEGIES


We offer our clients a number of investment options, each with a different focus.




MERGER ARBITRAGE


• Pure merger arbitrage
• Low volatility
• Uncorrelated
 
Seeks to produce consistent, uncorrelated returns with low volatility by investing in mergers and acquisitions.  All deals are fundamentally researched and analyzed from a strategic, regulatory, financial, and stakeholder perspective.  We believe our strict deal criteria and disciplined risk controls have allowed us to consistently deliver attractive risk-adjusted outcomes across various market cycles.




EVENT DRIVEN


• Merger arbitrage + special situations
• Full capital structure
• Hard & soft catalyst
 
Seeks to dynamically allocate capital across hard and soft catalyst opportunity sets.  The strategy attempts to pursue merger arbitrage & special situations throughout the capital structure.  The preference is for convex return profiles (focused on limiting downside while providing attractive upside potential) in every investment.  The strategy focuses on capital structure, liquidity, and risk-adjusted return analysis within each event. Events may be either positive or negative, including but not limited to corporate actions, recapitalizations, reorganization, change in industry dynamics, and/or corporate strategy change.




EQUITY


• Long/short
• Long only
• Private
 
Seeks to invest in fundamentally advantaged companies effecting disruptive innovation in an industry and those that are undergoing positive change as the result of one or more catalysts acting as a force to drive growth or unlock potential.
