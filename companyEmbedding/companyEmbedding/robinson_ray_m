					    An orphan who dreams of someday finding a family to call his own finds his fate taking an unexpected turn when a mysterious stranger named Wilbur Robinson transports him into the future. Based on the book -A Day With Wilbur Robinson by William Joyce, Meet the Robinsons tells the story of a boy with a lifelong wish to belong, and shows what happens when he meets an incredible collection of characters who just might have the power to make his wildest fantasies come true. The film's all-star cast of vocal contributors -- including Angela Bassett, Kelly Ripa, Tom Selleck, Adam West, Steve Zahn, and Laurie Metcalf -- brings the world of the future to life as never before seen on the silver screen. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi

Synopsis 

An orphan who dreams of someday finding a family to call his own finds his fate taking an unexpected turn when a mysterious stranger named Wilbur Robinson transports him into the future. Based on the book -A Day With Wilbur Robinson by William Joyce, Meet the Robinsons tells the story of a boy with a lifelong wish to belong, and shows what happens when he meets an incredible collection of characters who just might have the power to make his wildest fantasies come true. The film's all-star cast of vocal contributors -- including Angela Bassett, Kelly Ripa, Tom Selleck, Adam West, Steve Zahn, and Laurie Metcalf -- brings the world of the future to life as never before seen on the silver screen. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi

Biography  |




 Interview Date:  8/14/2003 
 Business executive, community developer, and golf enthusiast, Ray M. Robinson was born on November 30, 1947, in McKinney, Texas.  Robinson grew up in Dallas, and while still in high school worked as a communication technician, beginning a thirty-five-year career with AT&T.
In 1970, Robinson earned his B.A. degree in finance from the University of Denver, and the following year he received his M.B.A., degree also from that same institution.  Simultaneously, Robinson began his climb up the corporate ladder at AT&T, relocating thirteen times as he took new assignments in marketing, sales, and regulatory affairs.  Robinson finally settled in Atlanta, where he became president of the company's southern region.
Upon his retirement from AT&T in 2003, Robinson, an avid golfer, assumed the presidency of Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club and became vice chairman of the East Lake Community Foundation.  Robinson helped revive Atlanta's historic golf course and revitalize the inner-city neighborhood surrounding it through redevelopment.  This redevelopment included East Lake Family YMCA and Eastlake Junior Golf Academy.  Under Robinson's leadership, the golf club signed a multiyear partnership with the Professional Golf Association, making the East Lake Course the primary host venue for the PGA Championship Tour.
Robinson served on the board of directors for several businesses and organizations, including Citizens Trust Bank, the Atlanta Metro Chamber of Commerce, and the Atlanta Tribune Editorial Advisory Board.  Additionally, Robinson belonged to several civic groups, including the 100 Black Men of Atlanta and the NAACP.  Robinson and his wife, Arlane, were married in 1969; the raised two children.

Description





Robinson Crusoe
On a tiny exotic island, Tuesday, an outgoing parrot lives with his quirky
animal friends. After a violent storm, Tuesday and his friends wake up to find a
strange creature on the beach: Robinson Crusoe. Tuesday immediately views Crusoe
as his ticket off the island to explore new lands. Likewise, Crusoe soon
realizes that the key to surviving on the island is through the help of Tuesday
and the other animals.
Robinson Crusoe Reviews
“High-energy excitement.” – Variety
“An impressively made if highly juvenile version of a literary
classic.” – Hollywood Reporter
