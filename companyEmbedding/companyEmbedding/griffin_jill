College of Customer Winback

Individuals
Want to win back lost customers?  We’ve got you covered! 
We’ll design a learning menu just for you.  Using our proprietary Skills Finder guide, we’ll help you  pinpoint your customer win back learning priorities. Next, you’ll specify your time frame, your budget and “Presto!” – we’ll tailor a training curriculum just for you.  Training options may include: 

Full run of exclusive password-protected website with tailored course content
Exercises and learning projects designed around your current job responsibilities
Training tailored to your specific customer and account challenges
Instructor led tele-discussions with peer learners
One-on-one coaching

Business
Your firm’s win back learning needs are unique.  Your firm deserves a learning system that:
– addresses your firm’s particular win back issues
– is custom tailored to your org chart
– places high priority on skill sets that deliver immediate ROI.  
Whether it’s training your sales team, first-line managers, customer service reps, executive team, or some combination, we’ll work closely with your firm  to design a win back training curriculum that equips your firm with the necessary skills to win back lost customers.  Training options may include:

Custom Portals with tailored course content
Instructor-led, onsite training
Exercises and learning projects designed around the firm’s particular win back issues
Training tailored to your specific lost (and/or at-risk) customers and accounts
One-on-one coaching
Team coaching

Boardroom
Customer win back success begins in the boardroom.  Jill serves as corporate director on numerous boards, both public and private, for-profit and not-for-profit.  She knows first-hand the importance of getting customer win-back oversight on the board’s radar screen.  
Customer win back board training is completely customizable to suit individual needs and administered at a time and place convenient for board members. 
Customer win back is an often overlooked profit recovery strategy in many firms for one key reason:  losing a customer is ‘bad news’ and unraveling the whole “sordid” situation can be a thankless, and down-right dangerous job.  It can cost you internal allies and get you attacked (think: ‘shoot the messenger’ dilemma).  Everyone wants to run from the blame.  A board can play a critical role in moving the corporation away from this dynamic.

Fourth of July
http://theloyaltymaker.com/fourth-of-july/
		Sun, 03 Jul 2016 20:02:35 +0000


http://theloyaltymaker.com/?p=1898


Dear Friends,
The Fourth of July has a special place in my heart. 
This year, George Washington and General Robert Herres come to mind.
As our history teachers taught us…. Washington was our first President, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He presided over the convention that drafted the United States Constitution, which remains the supreme law of our land.
My late friend and generous sponsor, Four-Star General Robert Herres, then USAA Chairman, graciously wrote the Foreword of the second edition of my book, Customer Loyalty.  General Washington was the focus of his comments. Here’s an excerpt:
“Years ago, I read a comment by George Washington on the “essential characteristics or traits of the general officers of the Continental Army: character, professional ability, integrity, prudence and loyalty. Many times since, I have thought how timeless and relevant this formula is—not just for military people, but for people in the business world and, in fact, in any professional endeavor. In the language of his day, General Washington spoke of the importance of competence (professional ability), good judgment (prudence), and the enduring virtues of character, integrity and loyalty. Reflecting on these qualities, it seems to me that the first four attributes when acquired and sustained will ultimately inspire the latter: the precious but elusive presence of loyalty.”
This Fourth of July I give thanks to God for the competence, prudence, character, integrity and loyalty that Washington modeled and instilled into our Continental Army. They made grave sacrifices that drove the birth of our great country.
I am also indebted to General Herres for his loyalty and deep service to our country and for his invaluable contributions to my life.
Happy 4th of July!
JILL

Getting Minorities On Corporate Boards: More Work Ahead

http://theloyaltymaker.com/?p=1887


Published by the C Suite Network
June 14, 2016/in Leadership, Management, People 

By Jill Griffin – Author of the new book, Earn Your Seat On a Corporate Board
New York Times reporter, Elizabeth Olson, shares stats that reflect the “still lagging” indicators on efforts to diversify America’s corporate boards.
Here’s a few highlights from her insightful “Barriers to Boards” article:
·     While 399 new directors were selected for top company boards last year, Hispanics claimed only 16 seats.  This, while Hispanics comprise 17 percent of the overall U.S. population.
·     In comparison, there are slight increases in African American representation, but a decline in the number of Asians and Asian-Americans selected to fill board seats.
·     While the percentage of new women directors has risen each year, sources say the projection that women can reach parity with men in the number of new directors by 2024 has been projected downward.  Now, 2026 is the projected year.
Bonnie W. Gwin, a co-managing partner of Heidrick & Struggles executive recruitment global C.E.O. and board practice, reports the biggest entry obstacle for minorities is the lack of operating or financial experience.
For example, the dearth of Hispanic board members appears to originate largely from the shortage of Hispanic chief executives, reports Cid C. Wilson, Chief Executive of the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility.  The bleak statistic is that only nine Hispanics currently serve as CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, while the U.S. has the second-largest Spanish-speaking population in world, second only to Mexico.
The pipeline of talented, board-ready minorities needs to be filled.  Hispanics, African Americans, and women need to be nurtured as general managers, finance execs and operational leaders.
The push to get more diversity in boardrooms is still a steep hill to climb.
But make no mistake about it:
Diversified corporate boards help CEOs build cultures that engage employees and, in turn, ignite the customer loyalty necessary for driving corporate revenue.

Networking is more than a fleeting conversation. It’s a series of interactions. These connections are vital to helping you search out board opportunities. Moreover, when companies hone in on one or two candidates, they’ll do reference checks among people they know and trust. As a result, it’s critical to continuously expand and enrich your network and get to know people who can vouch for you.

Company: Eosera Co-founders Elyse Dickerson and Joe Griffin 


JILL JOHNSON






















































































Named after the Greek goddess of dawn and the word time, Eosera Inc. represents a time for new beginnings for the co-founders and focuses on healing humans.The co-founders of the Fort Worth-based company are CEO Elyse Dickerson and Joe Griffin, chief scientific officer, and while Griffin says his skills are on the scientific side, Dickerson’s skills are in commercialization and marketing.Eosera is the biotechnology company that created Earwax MD, an earwax dissolvent product that the news release said was sold out on Amazon Exclusives in the first month after it was released in May. During the development process, they worked with groups such as TMAC (Texas Manufacturing Assistance Center) and TECH Fort Worth. They both took time to talk with The Fort Worth Business Press about creating the product.
Why Earwax MD?Dickerson: The first two months, all we did … was talk to people and we would just set meetings with all types of doctors, all types of patients, and it was really just us listening. With every doctor, especially, we would ask, “Okay, so what are some conditions that you see on a regular basis that you think are not being met or that could be treated more efficiently or effectively?” And surprisingly, earwax impaction rose to the top. …After we kept hearing this over and over, we went back to the medical literature and started reading about it and trying to understand more about it and what we realized was, it’s not a real what I’d call sexy or exciting topic and so I think big pharmaceutical companies have sort of just [said], “It’s not cancer, it’s not life threatening,” so they’ve kind of stayed away from it, but it is something that our health care systems spend a tremendous amount of money on trying to remedy the problem.What is your relationship with TECH Fort Worth?Dickerson: We had a few friends tell us about this incubator and it sits right at the corner of Rosedale and I-35 in a city-owned building and the city really supports this mission of entrepreneurship and growing small businesses in Fort Worth to help the economy. TECH Fort Worth has one of three buildings and they have clients then that are startup companies and you essentially apply to be part of the program and so we office here. We have access to really incredible mentorship on a weekly basis.TECH Fort Worth has a partnership with UNT Health Science Center and we were able to use their shared lab space, which as a startup there’s no way we could have afforded to build our own lab or even really pay retail price for renting a real lab so we got a significantly discounted rate. … We were at UNT Health Science Center pretty much every day for the first year in their lab developing our product and we would never have had that access if not for TECH Fort Worth and their partnerships they created.What was the process for working with TMAC?Griffin: TMAC was recommended to us and we were introduced to them through TECH Fort Worth. We had an initial meeting with the TMAC team and we basically had a little interview and meeting with them to find out what services they provided and what services we needed.Then we got kind of assigned to, initially, a couple of the different TMAC departments, one related to quality, understanding quality systems and how the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] and other regulatory agencies look at product development … one was related to design of products and design of packaging. …As we continued to develop our product and as we continued to refine our target product, we ended up working almost exclusively with one of the departments at TMAC that helped us, again, complete the quality program. …It wasn’t a static time and we’re still working with TMAC really weekly… and as we begin the development of our next product we’re fully hoping that we can continue the relationship in a similar manner.Why did the company choose both in-house and third-party manufacturing?Dickerson: We could save on the cost by doing it ourselves. Really the emphasis behind us taking it on was one of our key advisors who is the director of TECH Fort Worth, Darlene Boudreaux. She ran a contract manufacturing company for her entire career and then sold that business and as one of our mentors she sort of sat us down and said, “Look you guys. You can do this.”We decided to sort of step our toe into it and now we’ve taken on more of the production ourselves. It really was driven by cost, that we could do it more efficiently and have a tighter control over the finished goods.Why was the product launched with Amazon first?
Dickerson: I had a goal of really wanting to have a controlled launch mainly because we were new to this, to running the business ourselves.We both had come from the pharmaceutical industry but we also had huge divisions that did the manufacturing and the distribution. We had all these support networks that we didn’t have to worry about all those kinds of things.When it was really just me and Joe, we decided that let’s launch small and controlled so if there are any issues we can pivot quickly and test and learn, if you will. And so, launching on Amazon really gave us a lot of control. …And we learned. We had some product that was leaking in our first shipment that we had to pull back and we ended up changing the bottle and the cap. We also ended up changing the label … because it wasn’t holding up the way we thought that it should. Little things like that. We were able to pivot really quickly based on just a few hundred units out into the market. So that was really the reason we launched on Amazon.How is the company holding to conscious capitalism?Dickerson: The philosophy is that you have a higher purpose over profit and that purpose can vary depending on the type of company you have.But for us, for example, we put people before profits and the belief is that if you have something, a bigger reason for being, that the profits will follow. …When we decided to start our company, the foundation of our company is healing humans and that’s really in a broader sense. Yes, we want our medications or our products that we bring to market to physically heal people, but we also want to provide a work environment where our employees feel valued and encouraged and have opportunities to grow in their career.Our investors feel like we have their best interest at heart and that we’re open, too. It’s a two-way street. We’re open to listening from them and learning from them just as much as they are from us.Then the patient, really listening to the patient and the doctor and understanding what are unmet medical needs out there that we could potentially address in the future.

Company: Eosera Co-founders Elyse Dickerson and Joe Griffin 


JILL JOHNSON






















































































Named after the Greek goddess of dawn and the word time, Eosera Inc. represents a time for new beginnings for the co-founders and focuses on healing humans.The co-founders of the Fort Worth-based company are CEO Elyse Dickerson and Joe Griffin, chief scientific officer, and while Griffin says his skills are on the scientific side, Dickerson’s skills are in commercialization and marketing.Eosera is the biotechnology company that created Earwax MD, an earwax dissolvent product that the news release said was sold out on Amazon Exclusives in the first month after it was released in May. During the development process, they worked with groups such as TMAC (Texas Manufacturing Assistance Center) and TECH Fort Worth. They both took time to talk with The Fort Worth Business Press about creating the product.
Why Earwax MD?Dickerson: The first two months, all we did … was talk to people and we would just set meetings with all types of doctors, all types of patients, and it was really just us listening. With every doctor, especially, we would ask, “Okay, so what are some conditions that you see on a regular basis that you think are not being met or that could be treated more efficiently or effectively?” And surprisingly, earwax impaction rose to the top. …After we kept hearing this over and over, we went back to the medical literature and started reading about it and trying to understand more about it and what we realized was, it’s not a real what I’d call sexy or exciting topic and so I think big pharmaceutical companies have sort of just [said], “It’s not cancer, it’s not life threatening,” so they’ve kind of stayed away from it, but it is something that our health care systems spend a tremendous amount of money on trying to remedy the problem.What is your relationship with TECH Fort Worth?Dickerson: We had a few friends tell us about this incubator and it sits right at the corner of Rosedale and I-35 in a city-owned building and the city really supports this mission of entrepreneurship and growing small businesses in Fort Worth to help the economy. TECH Fort Worth has one of three buildings and they have clients then that are startup companies and you essentially apply to be part of the program and so we office here. We have access to really incredible mentorship on a weekly basis.TECH Fort Worth has a partnership with UNT Health Science Center and we were able to use their shared lab space, which as a startup there’s no way we could have afforded to build our own lab or even really pay retail price for renting a real lab so we got a significantly discounted rate. … We were at UNT Health Science Center pretty much every day for the first year in their lab developing our product and we would never have had that access if not for TECH Fort Worth and their partnerships they created.What was the process for working with TMAC?Griffin: TMAC was recommended to us and we were introduced to them through TECH Fort Worth. We had an initial meeting with the TMAC team and we basically had a little interview and meeting with them to find out what services they provided and what services we needed.Then we got kind of assigned to, initially, a couple of the different TMAC departments, one related to quality, understanding quality systems and how the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] and other regulatory agencies look at product development … one was related to design of products and design of packaging. …As we continued to develop our product and as we continued to refine our target product, we ended up working almost exclusively with one of the departments at TMAC that helped us, again, complete the quality program. …It wasn’t a static time and we’re still working with TMAC really weekly… and as we begin the development of our next product we’re fully hoping that we can continue the relationship in a similar manner.Why did the company choose both in-house and third-party manufacturing?Dickerson: We could save on the cost by doing it ourselves. Really the emphasis behind us taking it on was one of our key advisors who is the director of TECH Fort Worth, Darlene Boudreaux. She ran a contract manufacturing company for her entire career and then sold that business and as one of our mentors she sort of sat us down and said, “Look you guys. You can do this.”We decided to sort of step our toe into it and now we’ve taken on more of the production ourselves. It really was driven by cost, that we could do it more efficiently and have a tighter control over the finished goods.Why was the product launched with Amazon first?
Dickerson: I had a goal of really wanting to have a controlled launch mainly because we were new to this, to running the business ourselves.We both had come from the pharmaceutical industry but we also had huge divisions that did the manufacturing and the distribution. We had all these support networks that we didn’t have to worry about all those kinds of things.When it was really just me and Joe, we decided that let’s launch small and controlled so if there are any issues we can pivot quickly and test and learn, if you will. And so, launching on Amazon really gave us a lot of control. …And we learned. We had some product that was leaking in our first shipment that we had to pull back and we ended up changing the bottle and the cap. We also ended up changing the label … because it wasn’t holding up the way we thought that it should. Little things like that. We were able to pivot really quickly based on just a few hundred units out into the market. So that was really the reason we launched on Amazon.How is the company holding to conscious capitalism?Dickerson: The philosophy is that you have a higher purpose over profit and that purpose can vary depending on the type of company you have.But for us, for example, we put people before profits and the belief is that if you have something, a bigger reason for being, that the profits will follow. …When we decided to start our company, the foundation of our company is healing humans and that’s really in a broader sense. Yes, we want our medications or our products that we bring to market to physically heal people, but we also want to provide a work environment where our employees feel valued and encouraged and have opportunities to grow in their career.Our investors feel like we have their best interest at heart and that we’re open, too. It’s a two-way street. We’re open to listening from them and learning from them just as much as they are from us.Then the patient, really listening to the patient and the doctor and understanding what are unmet medical needs out there that we could potentially address in the future.
