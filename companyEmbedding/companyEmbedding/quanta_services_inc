(NYSE:PWR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Quanta Services Acquires Stronghold Companies For Up To $550 MillionJul.21.17 | About: Quanta Services (PWR) Donovan Jones IPOs, tech, alternative investments, CEO VentureDeal.comVentureDealSummaryQuanta Services has completed the acquisition of the Stronghold family of companies.Stronghold provides a wide range of services to midstream and downstream refining and petrochemical firms.The deal should provide Quanta with greater penetration into the midstream and downstream markets, which promise better profitability than oilfield services firms.





 Quick Take Contracting services company Quanta Services (PWR) has acquired the Stronghold family of companies for cash and stock valued at $450 million. Stronghold, Ltd. and Stronghold Specialty operate ten specialty services companies that serve the midstream and downstream oil & gas markets across most of the U.S. Quanta’s acquisition of Stronghold portfolio of services promises to take advantage of increased energy production trends in the U.S. Target Company La Porte, Texas-based Stronghold was founded in 2002 and is headed by CEO Joe Durham. The combined groups have 2,800 employees and provide a wide range of services to the refining and petrochemical industry including:  Fabrication Piping Specialty Tank Inspection Instrument & Electrical Maintenance & Construction Cat-Spec Turnaround Services 
 Stronghold operates in most U.S. petrochemical regions and said that the existing management team will continue in place under CEO Joe Durham as a ‘platform operating unit of Quanta.’ Acquisition Terms and Rationale Quanta paid $360 million in upfront cash and 2.7 million shares of its common stock valued at $90 million. Additionally, Stronghold shareholders may earn an additional amount of up to $100 million ‘if cumulative three-year EBITDA targets are achieved.’ As of Quanta’s March 31 2017 10-Q, the firm had $106.5 million in cash and equivalents, accounts receivable of $1.59 billion and total liabilities of $2.14 billion. Cash flow from operations in 1Q 2017 was negative $3.8 million compared to positive $205.8 million in 1Q 2016. As to financial effects from the deal, it appears to be accretive to GAAP diluted EPS by $0.02 to $0.03 per share in 2017. Quanta management expects accretion to increase in 2018, but did not provide an estimate as to how much. The deal is a significant one for $5 billion market cap Quanta. As Duke Austin, President and CEO of Quanta stated in the deal announcement, We remain positive on our 2017 and multi-year outlook and believe Stronghold is a strategic acquisition that will allow us to capture a greater portion of the energy industry operating and capital spend. With positive industry dynamics, visible cross-selling opportunities and Quanta's support, we believe there is a multi-year opportunity for Stronghold's operations to achieve double digit growth. Stronghold's recurring revenues, accretive operating income margin profile and strong free cash flow generation align well with our strategic imperatives for long-term profitable growth.  While upstream oilfield services providers continue to face a brutal pricing environment, CEO Austin’s positive outlook on ‘industry dynamics’ is cause for optimism in the midstream and downstream markets, which promise to grow significantly as the U.S. shale boom continues to battle OPEC with increased production.
 I view the deal as a positive for Quanta in the medium-term, in conjunction with its buyback plan increase and the positive U.S. political environment for Quanta’s growing list of services.

Hyatt Hotels Corp Larger Than S&P 500 Component Quanta Services

In the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Hyatt Hotels Corp (Symbol: H) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Quanta Services, Inc. (Symbol: PWR), according to The Online Investor  . Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true "apples-to-apples" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Hyatt Hotels Corp (Symbol: H), the market cap is now $5B, versus Quanta Services, Inc. (Symbol: PWR) at $4.9B.    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of H vs. PWR (Note that we have found 1 split in the H split history  ):       Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and "tosses out" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller "up-and-comers" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.      H,PWR makes up 1760.91% of the iShares Russell 2500 ETF ( SMMD  )    At the closing bell, H is off about 0.3%, while PWR is up about 0.9% on the day Friday.

Quanta Services acquires services company Stronghold
7/21/2017























HOUSTON — Quanta Services, Inc. announced that it has completed the acquisition of Stronghold, Ltd. and Stronghold Specialty, Ltd., a specialized services company that provides high pressure and critical path solutions to the downstream and midstream energy markets.
Headquartered in La Porte, Texas, Stronghold has a strong presence in the Gulf Coast refinery and petrochemical market and serves nearly all regions of the United States. Stronghold generated revenues of approximately $500 MM for the full year of 2016 and has a workforce averaging approximately 2,800 employees. Stronghold's operations will be reflected in Quanta's Oil and Gas Infrastructure services segment.
The transaction consideration consists of an upfront payment of approximately $450 MM, comprised of $360 MM of cash and 2.7 MM shares of Quanta Services common stock valued at approximately $90 MM, with a cash and stock earnout that could provide maximum additional consideration of $100 MM if cumulative 3-yr EBITDA targets are achieved.
Stronghold's existing management team will remain in place, with founder Joe Durham continuing in his leadership role as Chief Executive Officer of Stronghold. With a skilled, dedicated and high-quality workforce, Stronghold will serve as a platform operating unit of Quanta.
Harris Williams & Co. served as financial advisor and Baker Botts L.L.P. served as legal advisor to Quanta for the transaction.

Electric Power Regional Structure









Building the Future





Lazy Q Ranch
Founder of Quanta Services, John Colson, envisioned a place that the industry workforce could be trained under the strictest safety measures and with the best talent available. Colson succeeded in this and opened the Lazy Q Ranch in August of 2015.
Nestled in the small town of La Grange, Texas is the Lazy Q Ranch, a world class training facility. Situated on over 2,100 acres the Lazy Q is home to the most rigorous training operation in the industry. The focus is on safety education, skill development and certifications.
Electric power linemen and customers can train on cutting-edge technology for all transmission structure types and up to 345kV. This area is powered by its own substation, completely separate from the power provided for the ranch. Quanta Energized Services oversees this portion of the training facility, bringing proprietary technology techniques to the workforce.
The oil and gas section houses pipelines in all major diameters, a flow loop and underground testing capabilities. The pipeline area was designed to be flexible and allow for various diameter pipes to be brought in for integrity testing and training, making this a custom-solution for training on a challenging project.
The telecommunications village features a small town with homes at various stages of construction. This enables development training at all milestones of a project.
The Lazy Q Ranch evolves with the industry and was designed to mirror Quanta’s growth. As we expand our service capabilities, so will the training facility.
Currently we are offering the following trainings:

AUT Technology
Barehand
Crane Training
Directional Drilling
Fiber Splicing
Fundamentals of Pipeline Inspection
Hot Stick
I&R
Inside Build
Lineman Training
Micro-Trenching
MT & UT Training & Certification
Pipeline Data Analyst
Q-Inline Prep for Field Based Inspection
Robotic Arm
Safety Accident Investigation Workshop
Tool Testing
Weights & Forces
Work Procedure Training



SHSU Partnership
Quanta-SHSU Workforce Development Program is an initiative to bring together higher-education and the business world, a symbiotic workforce development relationship. Beginning in the spring of 2017, the partnership began offering courses to develop job specific skills that expand the project manager level workforce. These students have mentors and exposure to the largest specialty contractor in North America, Quanta Services. In turn, through the partnership, Quanta will have access to the qualified candidates upon their graduation from Sam Houston State University (SHSU).
Quanta funded two additional SHSU professors. Coupled with Quanta managers, they created enhanced curriculum and a hands-on training experience. The pilot program is offering modified courses that are currently a part of the engineering technology department, a minimester and an internship program. Operating Unit and Quanta managers were able to advise on what would make a “good candidate for employment” and these 22 areas became a part of the enhanced syllabi.
The Utilities Project Management Minimester will begin in May of 2017. Students will spend an immersion week at the Lazy Q Ranch, Quanta’s world class training facility. Lead by mentors and facilitators, students will experience a real project through the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) lifecycle.  Also, students will work as teams to complete a project or address a challenge from Quanta’s own files.
The Utilities Industry Internship begins in the summer of 2017 and places the intern directly under a Houston-area project manager.  Quanta’s Operating Units, Dashiell, Mears Group, North Houston Pole Line, QPSE and Price Gregory will all be hosts. It is an eight-week paid internship that earns the candidates three credit hours.
“The Quanta Services partnership with SHSU is a unique, multi-dimensional partnership that will enrich the academic course offerings in the engineering technology program with academically and scholarly recognized faculty committed to innovative research and enlighten advanced industry-driven course offerings.”.
– Stanley Kelley, Science and Engineering Technology Department Chair

Safety
Mission Statement


Quanta Services is committed to the health and safety of our employees, customers, contractors and the communities in which we work. It is our mission to provide and maintain a safe work environment for our family of employees. Our core philosophy is that safety takes precedence over all business pursuits and work practices.






Vision


At Quanta, safety is a core value. Our job is to complete every project incident- and injury-free. Quanta’s management team creates a culture in which all employees have the opportunity and responsibility to take ownership for their safety and the safety of their coworkers. We’ve always held the belief that our most valuable asset – what truly sets us apart – is our employees. At the end of the day, there’s nothing more important than our employees coming home safely.









Commitment


We know that in order to reach the goal of ZERO incidents, the leaders must drive the safety initiatives. We are dedicated to bringing all of our people home each day, and that means having support from the top down. Not only are we committed to our employees, but Quanta is also committed to the industry we serve, to our customers and to our communities.
To demonstrate our commitment to our employees, the Quanta Commitment Coin is awarded to employees who go above and beyond the call of duty. The purpose of the Commitment Coin is to provide special recognition for workers who exemplify safe work habits and their commitment to safety. It is important to take the opportunity to identify and recognize those employees who sometimes go unnoticed but have demonstrated their commitment to a safe work environment.









AED Program


The goal of our Automated External Defibrillator (AED) program is to increase the rate of survival for people who have sudden cardiac arrests. The AED program is designed to provide equipment and training to enhance life safety response measures. AEDs make it possible for trained and untrained responders to administer defibrillation prior to the arrival of Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Our AED program continues to be a life-saving success for our workforce and communities around the world.






OSHA ET&D Partnership


The Electrical Transmission & Distribution Partnership is a formal collaboration of industry stakeholders, working together to improve safety for workers in the electric line construction industry. It is one of only a few national partnerships between employers and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Today, the ET&D Partnership covers an estimated 80 percent of total workers in the electric line construction industry.
Partnership goals include the following:

Analyze accident and incident data to identify common causes for fatalities, injuries and illnesses suffered by linemen, apprentices and other appropriate job classifications.
Develop recommended Best Practices for each identified cause.
Develop implementation strategies for each Best Practice and promote these strategies among the partners.
Identify training criteria for foremen, general foremen, supervisors, linemen and apprentices, including training to create industry culture change to place value on safety and health.

Quanta Services is a founding member of the partnership, and our Vice President of Safety, Health and Environmental, Matthew Compher, is the chairman of the Steering Team.

Operational Strategy


Quanta’s unique decentralized structure has allowed for our customers to rely on Operating Units they know and trust, but has given them the strength of being backed by a Fortune 500 company. Our Operating Units are often family run businesses that have decades of experience. When they join our family, they have access to resources and tools to perform larger and more complicated projects in a safe manner.





Regional Structure
Quanta is the largest specialty contractor in North America and in order to assist customers with communication and ease of access, the leadership team has created a regional structure. Each region is led by a Regional Vice President that has a strong understanding of the cultural, administrative, economic and political nuances of the area. This structure allows for a customer to have a straight-path for contact and information flow.







Growth
In order to stay the solution to energy infrastructure problems, Quanta researches and seizes opportunities to break into emerging markets. We offer a diverse portfolio of services and examine the latest technologies and the evolving canvas of the industry. Our trajectory is a result of our forward-thinking, enabling us to identify companies that are able to offer present and future growth for the company as a whole.







Invest in People
Quanta knows a project is only as good as the people that perform the work. We have dedicated a substantial amount of time and resources to the development of our current work force and the work force of the future. One of our greatest accomplishments is a state-of-the-art training facility, Lazy Q Ranch. We are looking ahead to bring new, safer work methods to employees and customers through training and education. An investment in people is an investment in our future.

Building the Future





Lazy Q Ranch
Founder of Quanta Services, John Colson, envisioned a place that the industry workforce could be trained under the strictest safety measures and with the best talent available. Colson succeeded in this and opened the Lazy Q Ranch in August of 2015.
Nestled in the small town of La Grange, Texas is the Lazy Q Ranch, a world class training facility. Situated on over 2,100 acres the Lazy Q is home to the most rigorous training operation in the industry. The focus is on safety education, skill development and certifications.
Electric power linemen and customers can train on cutting-edge technology for all transmission structure types and up to 345kV. This area is powered by its own substation, completely separate from the power provided for the ranch. Quanta Energized Services oversees this portion of the training facility, bringing proprietary technology techniques to the workforce.
The oil and gas section houses pipelines in all major diameters, a flow loop and underground testing capabilities. The pipeline area was designed to be flexible and allow for various diameter pipes to be brought in for integrity testing and training, making this a custom-solution for training on a challenging project.
The telecommunications village features a small town with homes at various stages of construction. This enables development training at all milestones of a project.
The Lazy Q Ranch evolves with the industry and was designed to mirror Quanta’s growth. As we expand our service capabilities, so will the training facility.
Currently we are offering the following trainings:

AUT Technology
Barehand
Crane Training
Directional Drilling
Fiber Splicing
Fundamentals of Pipeline Inspection
Hot Stick
I&R
Inside Build
Lineman Training
Micro-Trenching
MT & UT Training & Certification
Pipeline Data Analyst
Q-Inline Prep for Field Based Inspection
Robotic Arm
Safety Accident Investigation Workshop
Tool Testing
Weights & Forces
Work Procedure Training



SHSU Partnership
Quanta-SHSU Workforce Development Program is an initiative to bring together higher-education and the business world, a symbiotic workforce development relationship. Beginning in the spring of 2017, the partnership began offering courses to develop job specific skills that expand the project manager level workforce. These students have mentors and exposure to the largest specialty contractor in North America, Quanta Services. In turn, through the partnership, Quanta will have access to the qualified candidates upon their graduation from Sam Houston State University (SHSU).
Quanta funded two additional SHSU professors. Coupled with Quanta managers, they created enhanced curriculum and a hands-on training experience. The pilot program is offering modified courses that are currently a part of the engineering technology department, a minimester and an internship program. Operating Unit and Quanta managers were able to advise on what would make a “good candidate for employment” and these 22 areas became a part of the enhanced syllabi.
The Utilities Project Management Minimester will begin in May of 2017. Students will spend an immersion week at the Lazy Q Ranch, Quanta’s world class training facility. Lead by mentors and facilitators, students will experience a real project through the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) lifecycle.  Also, students will work as teams to complete a project or address a challenge from Quanta’s own files.
The Utilities Industry Internship begins in the summer of 2017 and places the intern directly under a Houston-area project manager.  Quanta’s Operating Units, Dashiell, Mears Group, North Houston Pole Line, QPSE and Price Gregory will all be hosts. It is an eight-week paid internship that earns the candidates three credit hours.
“The Quanta Services partnership with SHSU is a unique, multi-dimensional partnership that will enrich the academic course offerings in the engineering technology program with academically and scholarly recognized faculty committed to innovative research and enlighten advanced industry-driven course offerings.”.
– Stanley Kelley, Science and Engineering Technology Department Chair

The company is working with Deloitte on a five-year implementation of a new ERP package from JD Edwards for its various locations. The staff is now in the process of implementing modules for central corporate functions. Members of IT coordinate with the corporate services department on issues involving application support, particularly for departments like finance.

Since the company has a large number of employees working on projects in the field, it has employed the services of mindWire, an IT consulting firm, to help develop its capabilities using wireless technologies. Individuals in IT are dedicated to ensuring the security of the company's wireless communications network.

One major past initiative was moving to a new primary data center. The move, which took place in September of 2010, was made in order to take advantage of new and better electrical, heating and A/C systems, and give the company the ability to increase data center capacity.

The Enterprise Services group, which provides IT support to the corporation, also is responsible for IT at InfraSource and Quanta Technology, LLC, two company subsidiaries. Quanta Technology, a business division with about seventy employees, offers technology consulting services in areas such as the application of SmartGrid technology for the energy transmission business.

HOUSTON, July 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:   PWR) announced today that it has completed the acquisition of Stronghold, Ltd. and Stronghold Specialty, Ltd. (Stronghold), a leading specialized services company that provides high pressure and critical path solutions to the downstream and midstream energy markets. Headquartered in La Porte, Texas, Stronghold has a strong presence in the strategically important Gulf Coast refinery and petrochemical market and serves nearly all regions of the United States. The company has achieved strong organic growth by leveraging its operational excellence to expand into ten distinct specialty services companies, each providing platforms for future growth. Stronghold generated revenues of approximately $500 million for the full year of 2016 and has a workforce averaging approximately 2,800 employees. The industrial services market is a natural service line expansion for Quanta, further enabling Quanta to meet energy customers' needs. Stronghold's operations will be reflected in Quanta's Oil and Gas Infrastructure services segment.








"We remain positive on our 2017 and multiyear outlook and believe Stronghold is a strategic acquisition that will allow us to capture a greater portion of the energy industry operating and capital spend," said Duke Austin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quanta Services. "With positive industry dynamics, visible cross-selling opportunities and Quanta's support, we believe there is a multiyear opportunity for Stronghold's operations to achieve double digit growth. Stronghold's recurring revenues, accretive operating income margin profile and strong free cash flow generation align well with our strategic imperatives for long-term profitable growth. Stronghold is led by a multigenerational, experienced and well respected management team and, importantly, has a world-class, industry leading safety record. We welcome all of Stronghold's employees to the Quanta family."
The transaction consideration consists of an upfront payment of approximately $450 million, comprised of $360 million of cash and 2.7 million shares of Quanta Services common stock valued at approximately $90 million, with a cash and stock earnout that could provide maximum additional consideration of $100 million if cumulative three-year EBITDA targets are achieved. For the remainder of 2017, the acquisition of Stronghold is expected to generate $6.0 million to $7.5 million of net income attributable to common stock and to be accretive to Quanta's GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock by $0.02 to $0.03 and to non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock by $0.06 to $0.07, with accretion expected to increase in 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to common stock to account for, all net of tax, $3.0 million to $4.0 million of acquisition and integration costs, $2.0 million to $2.5 million of amortization expense associated with Stronghold's intangible assets and approximately $0.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to change.
"Quanta is an ideal cultural and strategic fit for Stronghold, and we are excited to join the Quanta family," said Joe Durham, Chief Executive Officer of Stronghold. "Both companies are committed to safety, our employees and our customers, which provide the foundation for success. Joining Quanta will provide significant resources to Stronghold as we look to build on our history of profitable growth and meet the growing needs of our customers in the years ahead."
Stronghold's existing management team will remain in place, with founder Joe Durham continuing in his leadership role as Chief Executive Officer of Stronghold. With a skilled, dedicated and high-quality workforce, Stronghold will serve as a platform operating unit of Quanta.
Harris Williams & Co. served as financial advisor and Baker Botts L.L.P. served as legal advisor to Quanta for the transaction.

Overview[edit]
Quanta Services was founded in 1997 to create an integrated, comprehensive and nationwide network of infrastructure contractors to meet the evolving needs of electric utility and telecommunications companies. With deregulation driving fundamental changes in the electric power industry, the founders anticipated a dramatic expansion in outsourcing of the design, installation, repair and maintenance of power transmission and power distribution networks.
The company quickly grew from $152 million in revenue in its first year to more than $2 billion in 2000. In addition to the telecommunications and power industries, Quanta soon started to develop capabilities in natural gas infrastructure, and has also expanded into a variety of specialty services. A list of their main services are listed below.

Current leadership[edit]
On March 14, 2016, Earl C. “Duke” Austin succeed former chief executive officer, Jim O’Neil. Austin is currently president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer. He is a graduate of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas and is the former president of Quanta’s Operating Unit, North Houston Pole Line.[4]
On April 2, 2012, Derrick A. Jensen succeed former chief financial officer, James H. Haddox. Jensen is a graduate of Oklahoma State University. [5]
Colson and PAR[edit]
The man behind the creation of Quanta Services is former executive chairman, John R. Colson.[6] After earning a degree in geology from the University of Missouri at Kansas City, Colson entered the military and served one year in Vietnam. He was discharged from the Army in 1971 and returned to Kansas City, taking temporary employment at PAR Electrical Contractors, Inc., which built high-voltage transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations, and provided other electric utility infrastructure services.
Colson's initial job was to carry stakes for a survey team. Within three years he was named manager of engineering services, and after six he had worked his way up to vice-president of operations. After becoming executive vice-president and general manager in the early 1980s, he began buying the company, became president in 1991, and ultimately emerged as its owner.
Initial formation[edit]
In the 1990s, the electrical contracting business was highly fragmented, populated by more than 50,000 companies, the vast majority of which were small, owner-operated enterprises. Deregulation in the electric utility industries in a number of states prompted utilities to become more cost-competitive, leading to the outsourcing of infrastructure work to contractors who could do the job more efficiently. Moreover, much of the transmission and distribution infrastructure in the United States was aging and in need of repair or replacement. In 1997, Colson spearheaded the combination of four contractors to form Quanta Services, Inc., which then established its headquarters in Houston with Colson as its head.[7] In addition to PAR, Quanta consisted of Union Power Construction Co., Trans Tech Electric Inc., and Potelco, Inc.
Initial public offering[edit]
With BT Alex Brown Incorporated, BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, and Sanders Morris Mundy Inc. serving as underwriters, Quanta completed its IPO in February 1998, raising $45 million. Of that amount, $21 million was used to pay the cash portion of the buyouts of the four founding companies. Much of the balance, along with a $175 million line of credit arranged with a consortium of nine banks, was used on over a dozen acquisitions completed in 1998. Acquired telecom companies included Manuel Brothers; Smith Contracting; Telecom Network Specialists; North Pacific Construction Company; NorAm Telecommunications; Spalj Construction Company; and Golden State Utility Company. Acquired electric contractors included Harker & Harker; Sumter Builders; and Environmental Professional Associates. Hybrid acquisitions included Wilson Roadbores and Underground Construction Company.
A secondary offering was completed in late January 1999. The company had planned to sell 3.5 million shares at $21 per share, but interest was so strong that in the end 4.6 million shares were sold at $23.25 per share. All told, Quanta realized $101.1 million, money used to fund the acquisition of 40 additional companies, which in total cost $323.6 million in cash and notes and 15 million shares of stock. Many of these additions were made to expand Quanta's business in gas transmission and cable television.
Fended takeover bid[edit]
In 2001 UtiliCorp United Inc. (now Aquila, Inc.), an energy company with whom PAR had been doing business since the 1950s, began taking steps to gain control of Quanta.[8] UtiliCorp owned about 36 percent of Quanta, an investment that was originally part of a strategic alliance when UtiliCorp outsourced all of its maintenance needs to Quanta. Quanta resisted, and in October 2001 the two parties signed a standstill agreement. A month later Quanta adopted a "poison pill" plan to prevent a takeover, prompting UtiliCorp to sue. A proxy fight ensued in the spring of 2002. Quanta maintained that UtiliCorp, which was enduring difficult times, wanted to gain controlling interest in order to consolidate Quanta's earnings with its own balance sheet. The fight came to an end in May 2002, as Quanta fended off the takeover bid.[9]
Sale of telecommunication and fiber-optic licensing divisions[edit]
On November 20, 2012, Quanta Services sold its telecommunications subsidiaries for $275 million in cash to Dycom. On August 4, 2015, Quanta Services sold its fiber optic licensing operations (Sunesys) to Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) for approximately $1 billion in cash.
Large acquisitions[edit]
On August 30, 2007, Quanta Services acquired InfraSource Services (NYSE: IFS) through an all-stock deal. Before the merger, Engineering News-Record ranked Quanta Services as the second-largest specialty contractor in the United States and InfraSource Services as No. 8.[10] This acquisition received popular attention after being given positive coverage on Jim Cramer's Mad Money show,[11] in Smart Money,[12] and in TheStreet.[13]
In September 2009, Quanta Services announced that a deal had been struck to acquire Price Gregory, the largest U.S. gas pipeline construction company, for $350 million.[14] With this acquisition, Quanta Services is expected to have consolidated 2009 revenue of $4.4 billion.
On October 22, 2010, Quanta Services announced agreement to acquire Canada's largest electric power line contractors Valard Construction for approximately US$219 million.[15]

Lower Rio Grande Valley Energized Reconductor Project[edit]
On June 13, 2016 American Electric Power (AEP) received the 89th annual Edison Electric Institute's (EEI's) 2016 Edison Award, the electric power industry's most prestigious honor, for its Energized Reconductor Project in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas.

Moreover, much of the transmission and distribution infrastructure in the United States was aging and in need of repair or replacement. In 1997, Colson spearheaded the combination of four contractors to form Quanta Services, Inc., which then established its headquarters in Houston with Colson as its head.[7] In addition to PAR, Quanta consisted of Union Power Construction Co., Trans Tech Electric Inc., and Potelco, Inc.
Initial public offering[edit]
With BT Alex Brown Incorporated, BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, and Sanders Morris Mundy Inc. serving as underwriters, Quanta completed its IPO in February 1998, raising $45 million. Of that amount, $21 million was used to pay the cash portion of the buyouts of the four founding companies. Much of the balance, along with a $175 million line of credit arranged with a consortium of nine banks, was used on over a dozen acquisitions completed in 1998. Acquired telecom companies included Manuel Brothers; Smith Contracting; Telecom Network Specialists; North Pacific Construction Company; NorAm Telecommunications; Spalj Construction Company; and Golden State Utility Company. Acquired electric contractors included Harker & Harker; Sumter Builders; and Environmental Professional Associates. Hybrid acquisitions included Wilson Roadbores and Underground Construction Company.
A secondary offering was completed in late January 1999. The company had planned to sell 3.5 million shares at $21 per share, but interest was so strong that in the end 4.6 million shares were sold at $23.25 per share. All told, Quanta realized $101.1 million, money used to fund the acquisition of 40 additional companies, which in total cost $323.6 million in cash and notes and 15 million shares of stock. Many of these additions were made to expand Quanta's business in gas transmission and cable television.
Fended takeover bid[edit]
In 2001 UtiliCorp United Inc. (now Aquila, Inc.), an energy company with whom PAR had been doing business since the 1950s, began taking steps to gain control of Quanta.[8] UtiliCorp owned about 36 percent of Quanta, an investment that was originally part of a strategic alliance when UtiliCorp outsourced all of its maintenance needs to Quanta. Quanta resisted, and in October 2001 the two parties signed a standstill agreement. A month later Quanta adopted a "poison pill" plan to prevent a takeover, prompting UtiliCorp to sue. A proxy fight ensued in the spring of 2002. Quanta maintained that UtiliCorp, which was enduring difficult times, wanted to gain controlling interest in order to consolidate Quanta's earnings with its own balance sheet. The fight came to an end in May 2002, as Quanta fended off the takeover bid.[9]
Sale of telecommunication and fiber-optic licensing divisions[edit]
On November 20, 2012, Quanta Services sold its telecommunications subsidiaries for $275 million in cash to Dycom. On August 4, 2015, Quanta Services sold its fiber optic licensing operations (Sunesys) to Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) for approximately $1 billion in cash.
Large acquisitions[edit]
On August 30, 2007, Quanta Services acquired InfraSource Services (NYSE: IFS) through an all-stock deal. Before the merger, Engineering News-Record ranked Quanta Services as the second-largest specialty contractor in the United States and InfraSource Services as No. 8.[10] This acquisition received popular attention after being given positive coverage on Jim Cramer's Mad Money show,[11] in Smart Money,[12] and in TheStreet.[13]
In September 2009, Quanta Services announced that a deal had been struck to acquire Price Gregory, the largest U.S. gas pipeline construction company, for $350 million.[14] With this acquisition, Quanta Services is expected to have consolidated 2009 revenue of $4.4 billion.
On October 22, 2010, Quanta Services announced agreement to acquire Canada's largest electric power line contractors Valard Construction for approximately US$219 million.[15]

Overview[edit]
Quanta Services was founded in 1997 to create an integrated, comprehensive and nationwide network of infrastructure contractors to meet the evolving needs of electric utility and telecommunications companies. With deregulation driving fundamental changes in the electric power industry, the founders anticipated a dramatic expansion in outsourcing of the design, installation, repair and maintenance of power transmission and power distribution networks.
The company quickly grew from $152 million in revenue in its first year to more than $2 billion in 2000. In addition to the telecommunications and power industries, Quanta soon started to develop capabilities in natural gas infrastructure, and has also expanded into a variety of specialty services. A list of their main services are listed below.

Current leadership[edit]
On March 14, 2016, Earl C. “Duke” Austin succeed former chief executive officer, Jim O’Neil. Austin is currently president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer. He is a graduate of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas and is the former president of Quanta’s Operating Unit, North Houston Pole Line.[4]
On April 2, 2012, Derrick A. Jensen succeed former chief financial officer, James H. Haddox. Jensen is a graduate of Oklahoma State University. [5]
Colson and PAR[edit]
The man behind the creation of Quanta Services is former executive chairman, John R. Colson.[6] After earning a degree in geology from the University of Missouri at Kansas City, Colson entered the military and served one year in Vietnam. He was discharged from the Army in 1971 and returned to Kansas City, taking temporary employment at PAR Electrical Contractors, Inc., which built high-voltage transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations, and provided other electric utility infrastructure services.
Colson's initial job was to carry stakes for a survey team. Within three years he was named manager of engineering services, and after six he had worked his way up to vice-president of operations. After becoming executive vice-president and general manager in the early 1980s, he began buying the company, became president in 1991, and ultimately emerged as its owner.
Initial formation[edit]
In the 1990s, the electrical contracting business was highly fragmented, populated by more than 50,000 companies, the vast majority of which were small, owner-operated enterprises.

Of that amount, $21 million was used to pay the cash portion of the buyouts of the four founding companies. Much of the balance, along with a $175 million line of credit arranged with a consortium of nine banks, was used on over a dozen acquisitions completed in 1998. Acquired telecom companies included Manuel Brothers; Smith Contracting; Telecom Network Specialists; North Pacific Construction Company; NorAm Telecommunications; Spalj Construction Company; and Golden State Utility Company. Acquired electric contractors included Harker & Harker; Sumter Builders; and Environmental Professional Associates. Hybrid acquisitions included Wilson Roadbores and Underground Construction Company.

Quanta resisted, and in October 2001 the two parties signed a standstill agreement. A month later Quanta adopted a "poison pill" plan to prevent a takeover, prompting UtiliCorp to sue. A proxy fight ensued in the spring of 2002. Quanta maintained that UtiliCorp, which was enduring difficult times, wanted to gain controlling interest in order to consolidate Quanta's earnings with its own balance sheet. The fight came to an end in May 2002, as Quanta fended off the takeover bid.[9]
Sale of telecommunication and fiber-optic licensing divisions[edit]
On November 20, 2012, Quanta Services sold its telecommunications subsidiaries for $275 million in cash to Dycom. On August 4, 2015, Quanta Services sold its fiber optic licensing operations (Sunesys) to Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) for approximately $1 billion in cash.
Large acquisitions[edit]
On August 30, 2007, Quanta Services acquired InfraSource Services (NYSE: IFS) through an all-stock deal. Before the merger, Engineering News-Record ranked Quanta Services as the second-largest specialty contractor in the United States and InfraSource Services as No. 8.[10] This acquisition received popular attention after being given positive coverage on Jim Cramer's Mad Money show,[11] in Smart Money,[12] and in TheStreet.[13]
In September 2009, Quanta Services announced that a deal had been struck to acquire Price Gregory, the largest U.S. gas pipeline construction company, for $350 million.[14] With this acquisition, Quanta Services is expected to have consolidated 2009 revenue of $4.4 billion.
On October 22, 2010, Quanta Services announced agreement to acquire Canada's largest electric power line contractors Valard Construction for approximately US$219 million.[15]

Overview[edit]
Quanta Services was founded in 1997 to create an integrated, comprehensive and nationwide network of infrastructure contractors to meet the evolving needs of electric utility and telecommunications companies. With deregulation driving fundamental changes in the electric power industry, the founders anticipated a dramatic expansion in outsourcing of the design, installation, repair and maintenance of power transmission and power distribution networks.
The company quickly grew from $152 million in revenue in its first year to more than $2 billion in 2000. In addition to the telecommunications and power industries, Quanta soon started to develop capabilities in natural gas infrastructure, and has also expanded into a variety of specialty services. A list of their main services are listed below.

Current leadership[edit]
On March 14, 2016, Earl C. “Duke” Austin succeed former chief executive officer, Jim O’Neil. Austin is currently president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer. He is a graduate of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas and is the former president of Quanta’s Operating Unit, North Houston Pole Line.[4]
On April 2, 2012, Derrick A. Jensen succeed former chief financial officer, James H. Haddox. Jensen is a graduate of Oklahoma State University. [5]
Colson and PAR[edit]
The man behind the creation of Quanta Services is former executive chairman, John R. Colson.[6] After earning a degree in geology from the University of Missouri at Kansas City, Colson entered the military and served one year in Vietnam. He was discharged from the Army in 1971 and returned to Kansas City, taking temporary employment at PAR Electrical Contractors, Inc., which built high-voltage transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations, and provided other electric utility infrastructure services.
Colson's initial job was to carry stakes for a survey team. Within three years he was named manager of engineering services, and after six he had worked his way up to vice-president of operations. After becoming executive vice-president and general manager in the early 1980s, he began buying the company, became president in 1991, and ultimately emerged as its owner.
Initial formation[edit]
In the 1990s, the electrical contracting business was highly fragmented, populated by more than 50,000 companies, the vast majority of which were small, owner-operated enterprises. Deregulation in the electric utility industries in a number of states prompted utilities to become more cost-competitive, leading to the outsourcing of infrastructure work to contractors who could do the job more efficiently. Moreover, much of the transmission and distribution infrastructure in the United States was aging and in need of repair or replacement. In 1997, Colson spearheaded the combination of four contractors to form Quanta Services, Inc., which then established its headquarters in Houston with Colson as its head.[7] In addition to PAR, Quanta consisted of Union Power Construction Co., Trans Tech Electric Inc., and Potelco, Inc.
Initial public offering[edit]
With BT Alex Brown Incorporated, BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, and Sanders Morris Mundy Inc. serving as underwriters, Quanta completed its IPO in February 1998, raising $45 million. Of that amount, $21 million was used to pay the cash portion of the buyouts of the four founding companies. Much of the balance, along with a $175 million line of credit arranged with a consortium of nine banks, was used on over a dozen acquisitions completed in 1998. Acquired telecom companies included Manuel Brothers; Smith Contracting; Telecom Network Specialists; North Pacific Construction Company; NorAm Telecommunications; Spalj Construction Company; and Golden State Utility Company. Acquired electric contractors included Harker & Harker; Sumter Builders; and Environmental Professional Associates. Hybrid acquisitions included Wilson Roadbores and Underground Construction Company.
A secondary offering was completed in late January 1999. The company had planned to sell 3.5 million shares at $21 per share, but interest was so strong that in the end 4.6 million shares were sold at $23.25 per share. All told, Quanta realized $101.1 million, money used to fund the acquisition of 40 additional companies, which in total cost $323.6 million in cash and notes and 15 million shares of stock. Many of these additions were made to expand Quanta's business in gas transmission and cable television.
Fended takeover bid[edit]
In 2001 UtiliCorp United Inc. (now Aquila, Inc.), an energy company with whom PAR had been doing business since the 1950s, began taking steps to gain control of Quanta.[8] UtiliCorp owned about 36 percent of Quanta, an investment that was originally part of a strategic alliance when UtiliCorp outsourced all of its maintenance needs to Quanta. Quanta resisted, and in October 2001 the two parties signed a standstill agreement. A month later Quanta adopted a "poison pill" plan to prevent a takeover, prompting UtiliCorp to sue. A proxy fight ensued in the spring of 2002. Quanta maintained that UtiliCorp, which was enduring difficult times, wanted to gain controlling interest in order to consolidate Quanta's earnings with its own balance sheet. The fight came to an end in May 2002, as Quanta fended off the takeover bid.[9]
Sale of telecommunication and fiber-optic licensing divisions[edit]
On November 20, 2012, Quanta Services sold its telecommunications subsidiaries for $275 million in cash to Dycom. On August 4, 2015, Quanta Services sold its fiber optic licensing operations (Sunesys) to Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) for approximately $1 billion in cash.
Large acquisitions[edit]
On August 30, 2007, Quanta Services acquired InfraSource Services (NYSE: IFS) through an all-stock deal. Before the merger, Engineering News-Record ranked Quanta Services as the second-largest specialty contractor in the United States and InfraSource Services as No. 8.[10] This acquisition received popular attention after being given positive coverage on Jim Cramer's Mad Money show,[11] in Smart Money,[12] and in TheStreet.[13]
In September 2009, Quanta Services announced that a deal had been struck to acquire Price Gregory, the largest U.S. gas pipeline construction company, for $350 million.[14] With this acquisition, Quanta Services is expected to have consolidated 2009 revenue of $4.4 billion.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Overview[edit]
Quanta Services was founded in 1997 to create an integrated, comprehensive and nationwide network of infrastructure contractors to meet the evolving needs of electric utility and telecommunications companies. With deregulation driving fundamental changes in the electric power industry, the founders anticipated a dramatic expansion in outsourcing of the design, installation, repair and maintenance of power transmission and power distribution networks.
The company quickly grew from $152 million in revenue in its first year to more than $2 billion in 2000. In addition to the telecommunications and power industries, Quanta soon started to develop capabilities in natural gas infrastructure, and has also expanded into a variety of specialty services. A list of their main services are listed below.

Current leadership[edit]
On March 14, 2016, Earl C. “Duke” Austin succeed former chief executive officer, Jim O’Neil. Austin is currently president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer. He is a graduate of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas and is the former president of Quanta’s Operating Unit, North Houston Pole Line.[4]
On April 2, 2012, Derrick A. Jensen succeed former chief financial officer, James H. Haddox. Jensen is a graduate of Oklahoma State University. [5]
Colson and PAR[edit]
The man behind the creation of Quanta Services is former executive chairman, John R. Colson.[6] After earning a degree in geology from the University of Missouri at Kansas City, Colson entered the military and served one year in Vietnam. He was discharged from the Army in 1971 and returned to Kansas City, taking temporary employment at PAR Electrical Contractors, Inc., which built high-voltage transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations, and provided other electric utility infrastructure services.
Colson's initial job was to carry stakes for a survey team. Within three years he was named manager of engineering services, and after six he had worked his way up to vice-president of operations. After becoming executive vice-president and general manager in the early 1980s, he began buying the company, became president in 1991, and ultimately emerged as its owner.
Initial formation[edit]
In the 1990s, the electrical contracting business was highly fragmented, populated by more than 50,000 companies, the vast majority of which were small, owner-operated enterprises. Deregulation in the electric utility industries in a number of states prompted utilities to become more cost-competitive, leading to the outsourcing of infrastructure work to contractors who could do the job more efficiently. Moreover, much of the transmission and distribution infrastructure in the United States was aging and in need of repair or replacement. In 1997, Colson spearheaded the combination of four contractors to form Quanta Services, Inc., which then established its headquarters in Houston with Colson as its head.[7] In addition to PAR, Quanta consisted of Union Power Construction Co., Trans Tech Electric Inc., and Potelco, Inc.
Initial public offering[edit]
With BT Alex Brown Incorporated, BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, and Sanders Morris Mundy Inc. serving as underwriters, Quanta completed its IPO in February 1998, raising $45 million. Of that amount, $21 million was used to pay the cash portion of the buyouts of the four founding companies. Much of the balance, along with a $175 million line of credit arranged with a consortium of nine banks, was used on over a dozen acquisitions completed in 1998. Acquired telecom companies included Manuel Brothers; Smith Contracting; Telecom Network Specialists; North Pacific Construction Company; NorAm Telecommunications; Spalj Construction Company; and Golden State Utility Company. Acquired electric contractors included Harker & Harker; Sumter Builders; and Environmental Professional Associates. Hybrid acquisitions included Wilson Roadbores and Underground Construction Company.
A secondary offering was completed in late January 1999. The company had planned to sell 3.5 million shares at $21 per share, but interest was so strong that in the end 4.6 million shares were sold at $23.25 per share. All told, Quanta realized $101.1 million, money used to fund the acquisition of 40 additional companies, which in total cost $323.6 million in cash and notes and 15 million shares of stock. Many of these additions were made to expand Quanta's business in gas transmission and cable television.
Fended takeover bid[edit]
In 2001 UtiliCorp United Inc. (now Aquila, Inc.), an energy company with whom PAR had been doing business since the 1950s, began taking steps to gain control of Quanta.[8] UtiliCorp owned about 36 percent of Quanta, an investment that was originally part of a strategic alliance when UtiliCorp outsourced all of its maintenance needs to Quanta. Quanta resisted, and in October 2001 the two parties signed a standstill agreement. A month later Quanta adopted a "poison pill" plan to prevent a takeover, prompting UtiliCorp to sue. A proxy fight ensued in the spring of 2002. Quanta maintained that UtiliCorp, which was enduring difficult times, wanted to gain controlling interest in order to consolidate Quanta's earnings with its own balance sheet. The fight came to an end in May 2002, as Quanta fended off the takeover bid.[9]
Sale of telecommunication and fiber-optic licensing divisions[edit]
On November 20, 2012, Quanta Services sold its telecommunications subsidiaries for $275 million in cash to Dycom. On August 4, 2015, Quanta Services sold its fiber optic licensing operations (Sunesys) to Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) for approximately $1 billion in cash.
Large acquisitions[edit]
On August 30, 2007, Quanta Services acquired InfraSource Services (NYSE: IFS) through an all-stock deal. Before the merger, Engineering News-Record ranked Quanta Services as the second-largest specialty contractor in the United States and InfraSource Services as No. 8.[10] This acquisition received popular attention after being given positive coverage on Jim Cramer's Mad Money show,[11] in Smart Money,[12] and in TheStreet.[13]
In September 2009, Quanta Services announced that a deal had been struck to acquire Price Gregory, the largest U.S. gas pipeline construction company, for $350 million.[14] With this acquisition, Quanta Services is expected to have consolidated 2009 revenue of $4.4 billion.
On October 22, 2010, Quanta Services announced agreement to acquire Canada's largest electric power line contractors Valard Construction for approximately US$219 million.[15]

Overview[edit]
Quanta Services was founded in 1997 to create an integrated, comprehensive and nationwide network of infrastructure contractors to meet the evolving needs of electric utility and telecommunications companies. With deregulation driving fundamental changes in the electric power industry, the founders anticipated a dramatic expansion in outsourcing of the design, installation, repair and maintenance of power transmission and power distribution networks.
The company quickly grew from $152 million in revenue in its first year to more than $2 billion in 2000. In addition to the telecommunications and power industries, Quanta soon started to develop capabilities in natural gas infrastructure, and has also expanded into a variety of specialty services. A list of their main services are listed below.

Overview[edit]
Quanta Services was founded in 1997 to create an integrated, comprehensive and nationwide network of infrastructure contractors to meet the evolving needs of electric utility and telecommunications companies. With deregulation driving fundamental changes in the electric power industry, the founders anticipated a dramatic expansion in outsourcing of the design, installation, repair and maintenance of power transmission and power distribution networks.
The company quickly grew from $152 million in revenue in its first year to more than $2 billion in 2000. In addition to the telecommunications and power industries, Quanta soon started to develop capabilities in natural gas infrastructure, and has also expanded into a variety of specialty services. A list of their main services are listed below.

Current leadership[edit]
On March 14, 2016, Earl C. “Duke” Austin succeed former chief executive officer, Jim O’Neil. Austin is currently president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer. He is a graduate of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas and is the former president of Quanta’s Operating Unit, North Houston Pole Line.[4]
On April 2, 2012, Derrick A. Jensen succeed former chief financial officer, James H. Haddox. Jensen is a graduate of Oklahoma State University. [5]
Colson and PAR[edit]
The man behind the creation of Quanta Services is former executive chairman, John R. Colson.[6] After earning a degree in geology from the University of Missouri at Kansas City, Colson entered the military and served one year in Vietnam. He was discharged from the Army in 1971 and returned to Kansas City, taking temporary employment at PAR Electrical Contractors, Inc., which built high-voltage transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations, and provided other electric utility infrastructure services.
Colson's initial job was to carry stakes for a survey team. Within three years he was named manager of engineering services, and after six he had worked his way up to vice-president of operations. After becoming executive vice-president and general manager in the early 1980s, he began buying the company, became president in 1991, and ultimately emerged as its owner.
Initial formation[edit]
In the 1990s, the electrical contracting business was highly fragmented, populated by more than 50,000 companies, the vast majority of which were small, owner-operated enterprises. Deregulation in the electric utility industries in a number of states prompted utilities to become more cost-competitive, leading to the outsourcing of infrastructure work to contractors who could do the job more efficiently. Moreover, much of the transmission and distribution infrastructure in the United States was aging and in need of repair or replacement. In 1997, Colson spearheaded the combination of four contractors to form Quanta Services, Inc., which then established its headquarters in Houston with Colson as its head.[7] In addition to PAR, Quanta consisted of Union Power Construction Co., Trans Tech Electric Inc., and Potelco, Inc.
Initial public offering[edit]
With BT Alex Brown Incorporated, BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, and Sanders Morris Mundy Inc. serving as underwriters, Quanta completed its IPO in February 1998, raising $45 million. Of that amount, $21 million was used to pay the cash portion of the buyouts of the four founding companies. Much of the balance, along with a $175 million line of credit arranged with a consortium of nine banks, was used on over a dozen acquisitions completed in 1998. Acquired telecom companies included Manuel Brothers; Smith Contracting; Telecom Network Specialists; North Pacific Construction Company; NorAm Telecommunications; Spalj Construction Company; and Golden State Utility Company. Acquired electric contractors included Harker & Harker; Sumter Builders; and Environmental Professional Associates. Hybrid acquisitions included Wilson Roadbores and Underground Construction Company.
A secondary offering was completed in late January 1999. The company had planned to sell 3.5 million shares at $21 per share, but interest was so strong that in the end 4.6 million shares were sold at $23.25 per share. All told, Quanta realized $101.1 million, money used to fund the acquisition of 40 additional companies, which in total cost $323.6 million in cash and notes and 15 million shares of stock. Many of these additions were made to expand Quanta's business in gas transmission and cable television.
Fended takeover bid[edit]
In 2001 UtiliCorp United Inc. (now Aquila, Inc.), an energy company with whom PAR had been doing business since the 1950s, began taking steps to gain control of Quanta.[8] UtiliCorp owned about 36 percent of Quanta, an investment that was originally part of a strategic alliance when UtiliCorp outsourced all of its maintenance needs to Quanta. Quanta resisted, and in October 2001 the two parties signed a standstill agreement. A month later Quanta adopted a "poison pill" plan to prevent a takeover, prompting UtiliCorp to sue. A proxy fight ensued in the spring of 2002. Quanta maintained that UtiliCorp, which was enduring difficult times, wanted to gain controlling interest in order to consolidate Quanta's earnings with its own balance sheet. The fight came to an end in May 2002, as Quanta fended off the takeover bid.[9]
Sale of telecommunication and fiber-optic licensing divisions[edit]
On November 20, 2012, Quanta Services sold its telecommunications subsidiaries for $275 million in cash to Dycom. On August 4, 2015, Quanta Services sold its fiber optic licensing operations (Sunesys) to Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) for approximately $1 billion in cash.
Large acquisitions[edit]
On August 30, 2007, Quanta Services acquired InfraSource Services (NYSE: IFS) through an all-stock deal. Before the merger, Engineering News-Record ranked Quanta Services as the second-largest specialty contractor in the United States and InfraSource Services as No. 8.[10] This acquisition received popular attention after being given positive coverage on Jim Cramer's Mad Money show,[11] in Smart Money,[12] and in TheStreet.[13]
In September 2009, Quanta Services announced that a deal had been struck to acquire Price Gregory, the largest U.S. gas pipeline construction company, for $350 million.[14] With this acquisition, Quanta Services is expected to have consolidated 2009 revenue of $4.4 billion.
On October 22, 2010, Quanta Services announced agreement to acquire Canada's largest electric power line contractors Valard Construction for approximately US$219 million.[15]

Lower Rio Grande Valley Energized Reconductor Project[edit]
On June 13, 2016 American Electric Power (AEP) received the 89th annual Edison Electric Institute's (EEI's) 2016 Edison Award, the electric power industry's most prestigious honor, for its Energized Reconductor Project in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas. The 240 mile project was possible because of Quanta Energized Services (QES) live-line planning capabilities and North Houston Pole Line’s construction expertise.[16]
