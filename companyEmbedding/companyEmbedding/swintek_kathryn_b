Since August 2010, Ms. Swintek has been a Managing Partner and member of the Investment Committee of Golden Seeds Fund 2, and Managing Director of Golden Seeds LLC, an angel investment forum backing women owned or managed early stage and growth companies. Prior to Golden Seeds, Ms. Swintek was a senior executive at BNP Paribas from November 1989 to April 2008, where she most recently served as Managing Director and Global Co-Head of its London-based Financial Sponsors Coverage Group. From 1974 to 1989, Ms. Swintek was a senior executive with Irving Trust Company (now known as BNY Mellon), where she was a Sr. Vice President and held positions in risk management and acquisition finance, and managed business relationships for the International Division in North Africa and the Near East, as well as in France, where she served as Representative while residing in Paris. Ms. Swintek is a former Chair of the Governing Board and the Executive Committee of The Committee of 200, a business women's leadership organization, which she joined in 2003. She serves on the Board of Directors of Bergen Medical Products, Inc., Turtle & Hughes, Inc., and Open Road Integrated Media, Inc. She is also a member of the Women's Forum, Women Corporate Directors, and Women Business Leaders of the U.S. Health Care Industry Foundation. We believe Ms. Swintek's qualifications to serve on our Board of Directors include her corporate leadership experience and her wide-ranging experience in international financial services.
