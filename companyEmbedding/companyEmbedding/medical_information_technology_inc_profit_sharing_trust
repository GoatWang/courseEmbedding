I thought I had opened a 401k with my old employer, but the statements I've been receiving say profit-sharing. Even more unusual, it looks like they are contributing, because the amounts of gone up even though I'm not contributing. Am I missing something here?Advisor answersJason BrooksCPA, CFP®A profit sharing plan is usually offered by an employer.  Typically it is linked with a 401k plan.  Each year the employer has the option of putting in company money on behalf of their employees in the form of a profit sharing contribution.  Usually these funds are subject to a vesting schedule meaning even though profit sharing dollars can be allocated to an employee/participant, they must work there for a defined period of time to receive it or vest.  Most of the 401k/profit sharing plans I deal with have 3 compo...Read moreGuy BakerAEP, CFP®, CLU, ChFCEmployers can offer a 401k with a match and a profit sharing contribution. The contribution does not impact the amount you can put into you 401k. The profit sharing contribution is a separate amount that is based on discretionary amounts the employer wants to put in the plan for the benefit of all the fulltime employees. It is allocated based on a percentage of salary. So you are fortunate.Most employers who do this are doing it so they can also maximize contributions to their own account. The pricetag of doing that is the contri...Read moreJ Kevin StophelMPAS, CRPS, CIMA, AIFA, CFP®It sounds like you may have a straight profit sharing plan that allows for employer discretionary contributions. It may be without a cash or deferred arrangement (CODA), which would allow you to defer compensation into the plan. If so, employers aren't required to fund the plan every year, but instead can do so at their discretion.On your statement, you should have the name and number of a person to call with questions. I suggest you call the number and speak with the individual asking them to explain the plan to you. Additionall...Read moreCharles J Stevens JrGood answers ahead of me. One thing they all omitted that you need to do. Either find the Summary Plan document you were given when you first joined the plan or get one from your Human Resources person. The Summary describes in layman's language how the plan works. It will tell you about making contributions, what additions your employer may make to your account and, most importantly, it will tell you what money is yours and what goes back to the company should you (or they) decide to leave the company.More and more companies today ar...Read moreAl KaufmanMBA, CRPC, CPA, CFP®Profit-sharing
plans represent various retirement accumulation structures recognized by the Department
of Labor and IRS whereby employers can help employees build retirement savings through
assorted contribution and tax-advantaged mechanisms. Assets are held in
retirement-based account structures which reflect the nature of the underlying

other retirement accounts. For instance, investments in a 401(k), or the

What is HIE?

Electronic health information exchange (HIE) allows doctors, nurses, pharmacists, other health care providers and patients to appropriately access and securely share a patient’s vital medical information electronically—improving the speed, quality, safety and cost of patient care.
Despite the widespread availability of secure electronic data transfer, most Americans’ medical information is stored on paper—in filing cabinets at various medical offices, or in boxes and folders in patients’ homes. When that medical information is shared between providers, it happens by mail, fax or—most likely—by patients themselves, who frequently carry their records from appointment to appointment. While electronic health information exchange cannot replace provider-patient communication, it can greatly improve the completeness of patient’s records, (which can have a big effect on care), as past history, current medications and other information is jointly reviewed during visits.
Appropriate, timely sharing of vital patient information can better inform decision making at the point of care and allow providers to

Avoid readmissions
Avoid medication errors
Improve diagnoses
Decrease duplicate testing

If a practice has successfully incorporated faxing patient information into their business process flow, they might question why they should transition to electronic health information exchange. Many benefits exist with information exchange regardless of the means of which is it transferred. However, the value of electronically exchanging is the standardization of data. Once standardized, the data transferred can seamlessly integrate into the recipients' Electronic Health Record (EHR), further improving patient care. For example:

If laboratory results are received electronically and incorporated into a provider’s EHR , a list of patients with diabetes can be generated. The provider can then determine which of these patients have uncontrolled blood sugar and schedule necessary follow-up appointments.1

There are currently three key forms of health information exchange:

Directed Exchange – ability to send and receive secure information electronically between care providers to support coordinated care
Query-based Exchange – ability for providers to find and/or request information on a patient from other providers, often used for unplanned care
Consumer Mediated Exchange – ability for patients to aggregate and control the use of their health information among providers

The foundation of standards, policies and technology required to initiate all three forms of health information exchange are complete, tested, and available today. The subsequent sections provide detailed information and example scenarios for each of the three forms.
Learn more about ONC standards, policies and technology.
DIRECTED EXCHANGE
Directed exchange is used by providers to easily and securely send patient information—such as laboratory orders and results, patient referrals, or discharge summaries—directly to another health care professional. This information is sent over the internet in an encrypted, secure, and reliable way amongst health care professionals who already know and trust each other, and is commonly compared to sending a secured email. This form of information exchange enables coordinated care, benefitting both providers and patients. For example:

A primary care provider can directly send electronic care summaries that include medications, problems, and lab results to a specialist when referring their patients. This information helps to inform the visit and prevents the duplication of tests, redundant collection of information from the patient, wasted visits, and medication errors.

Directed exchange is also being used for sending immunization data to public health organizations or to report quality measures to The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).
Got questions about Direct and how to use it? Read the Direct Basics: Q&A for Providers [PDF - 129 KB].
Learn more about the technology supporting directed exchange.
QUERY-BASED EXCHANGE
Query-based exchange is used by providers to search and discover accessible clinical sources on a patient. This type of exchange is often used when delivering unplanned care. For example:

Emergency room physicians who can utilize query-based exchange to access patient information—such as medications, recent radiology images, and problem lists—might adjust treatment plans to avoid adverse medication reactions or duplicative testing.
If a pregnant patient goes to the hospital, query-based exchange can assist a provider in obtaining her pregnancy care record, allowing them to make safer decisions about the care of the patient and her unborn baby.

Learn more about the technology supporting query-based exchange.
CONSUMER-MEDIATED EXCHANGE
Consumer-mediated exchange provides patients with access to their health information, allowing them to manage their health care online in a similar fashion to how they might manage their finances through online banking. When in control of their own health information, patients can actively participate in their care coordination by:

Providing other providers with their health information
Identifying and correcting wrong or missing health information
Identifying and correcting incorrect billing information
Tracking and monitoring their own health1

Learn more about the benefits of consumer-mediated exchange.

Health Information Exchange (HIE)






The demand for electronic health information exchange from one health care professional to another is growing along with nationwide efforts to improve the quality, safety and efficiency of health care delivery. Meaningful use requirements, new payment approaches that stress care coordination, and federal financial incentives are all driving the interest and demand for health information exchange.


Connecting Health and Care for the Nation: A 10 Year Vision to Achieve An Interoperable Health IT Infrastructure describes ONC’s broad vision and framework for interoperability.

What is HIE? 
Health Information Exchange allows health care professionals and patients to appropriately access and securely share a patient’s vital medical information electronically. There are many health care delivery scenarios driving the technology behind the different forms of health information exchange available today.
