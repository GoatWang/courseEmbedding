THOMAS R. EDGAR (TOM)
Thomas R. (Tom) Edgar
 Mr. Edgar is President of T. R. Edgar & Associates, a Consulting firm specializing in all aspects of Human Resources Management. The Firm’s primary mission is to help small to medium-sized companies increase their productivity and profitability through the more effective and efficient use of their principal resource – human capital. A by-product of this mission is to educate management on the need to comply with the myriad labor laws to help avoid litigation and to provide a positive environment in which employees can thrive. 
He is the principal author of a Career Progression Program that was copyrighted several years ago. This Program has been successfully implemented in over 50 companies throughout the United States, serving as a fundamental compensation system and, even more, the architecture of the entire Human Resources Program. Originally designed to meet the needs of the Professional Services/Government Contracting Industry, Mr. Edgar has made appropriate enhancements to ensure the Program’s successful implementation in various industries, including non-profits and municipalities.
Prior to starting his own Consulting practice, Mr. Edgar spent over 25 years in the corporate world where he served as a senior manager and principal Human Resources executive for a major bank and for 3 professional services companies supporting the Federal Government, primarily DOD. During his tenure, each of these companies enjoyed dramatic growth and success. In one case, the company had a highly successful public offering then, later, it was sold. The other 2 companies were also sold, including one as a result of a hostile takeover attempt prior to the entrance of a “white knight” that completed the transaction. In each case, Mr. Edgar gained invaluable experience about the corporate world, particularly about the integration of diverse cultures and workforces.
Mr. Edgar is a Certified Compensation Professional, a designation granted by the American Compensation Association (World at Work). He also maintains active membership in the Washington Technical Professional Forum (WTPF), the Association for Corporate Growth (ACG), the Washington Area Compensation and Benefits Association (WACABA), and the Human Resources Leadership Forum (HRLF).
Mr. Edgar earned an undergraduate degree from Boston University and a graduate degree in Human Resources from Central Michigan University. He has also served as Adjunct Professor/Instructor at The American University, Marymount University, and Virginia Tech.
Several organizations have taken advantage of Mr. Edgar’s extensive experience and qualifications and have engaged him to serve on a Board of Advisors or as a consultant to the Compensation Committee of the Board.

ThomasW.EagarProfessor of Materials Engineering and Engineering SystemsSB Metallurgy, MIT, 1972ScD Metallurgy, MIT, 19754-136Phone: (617) 253-3229tweagar@mit.eduPersonal Website
Disciplines: 


        Materials Systems and Analysis      

        Fracture, Fatigue, and Failure of Materials      

        Metallurgy      

        Structural Materials      


Research: Improvements in the reliability of fabricated materials require a better understanding of the physics and the chemistry of the processes that are used. Although most of Prof. Eagar's research involves welding and joining, an increasing amount of work involves other aspects of materials manufacturing and engineering systems.
Examples of recent research include:
Fundamentals of transient liquid phase diffusion bonding as applied to composites, superalloys and electronic packaging
Control of melting during gas metal arc welding
Effects of welding fume on health of workers
Stresses generated during joining of dissimilar materials
Improved methods of dimensional analysis of materials processing
Design, forming and assembly of automotive body components
Methods for successful product design and development
