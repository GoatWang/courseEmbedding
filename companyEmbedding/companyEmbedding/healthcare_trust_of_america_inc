About Healthcare Trust of America

DEDICATION TO MEDICAL OFFICE
HTA is dedicated to the medical office sector, which allows the company to create dedicated, long-term relationships with healthcare systems, academic medical centers and teaching hospitals, key physician groups, developers, and other industry participants in this space. The portfolio consists of medical office properties that will continue to be core-critical real estate to the delivery of healthcare as demand grows and as the integration of the macroeconomic tailwinds shape the delivery of care.
INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT PLATFORM DRIVES EFFICIENCY IN KEY MARKETS
HTA’s business strategy is underlined by establishing critical mass in key markets where HTA’s institutional property management and in-house leasing platform can generate scale, maximize expense efficiencies, and build lasting tenant relationships. To meet the specialized needs of healthcare providers, HTA has developed one of the industry’s most comprehensive asset management platforms that includes dedicated professionals in property management, leasing, engineering, accounting, construction and facilities management. Approximately 16 million square feet of space is currently managed by HTA’s national platform which is directed from HTA’s corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona and executed through several regional offices across 31 states.
CONSISTENT SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
HTA believes medical office buildings provide stable cash flows with relatively low vacancy risk, while still allowing for potentially higher returns through exposure to the fast growing healthcare sector. With dedication to this sector, HTA has generated shareholder returns that average 11% per annum since its founding through March 31, 2017. HTA pays a consistent dividend of $1.20 per annum, paid quarterly, that is supported by recurring and stable cash flows.
HEALTHCARE IS CHANGING
Medical Office benefiting from several significant macroeconomic drivers, such as an aging population, millennia ls beginning to form families, and an increase in the insured population. These trends are driving growth in healthcare spending at a rate significantly faster than the broader U.S. economy. The U.S. population is experiencing significant aging of its population, as advancements in medical technology and changes in treatment methods enable people to live longer. This is expected to drive healthcare utilization higher as individuals consume more healthcare as they get older. Between 2016 and 2026, the U.S. population over 65 years of age is projected to increase by more than 37% and total over 19% of the U.S. population as the baby boomer generation enters retirement. Individuals of this age spend the highest amounts on healthcare, averaging over $5,800 per individual over the age of 65 according to 2014 Consumer Expenditure Survey. This compares to healthcare expenditures of less than $1,600 per year for individuals under the age of 30. The older population group will increasingly require treatment and management of chronic and acute health ailments. Much of this increased care is taking place in lower cost outpatient settings, which we believe will continue to support MOB demand in the long term. 
In addition, the large millennial generation is just now starting to reach their thirties and form families, which should result in average healthcare expenditures for this age group doubling. As this large generation utilizes additional healthcare services, it is expected they will choose more convenient outpatient settings. The number of insured individuals in the U.S. continues to increase, as the population grows and as a result of the impact of U.S. government actions, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”). Since 1999, the number of individuals covered by healthcare insurance in the U.S. has increased over 20%. Although government policies may change under different administrations, the emphasis on providing affordable healthcare insurance for individuals is expected to remain a priority for government officials. 
At the same time, technological advances are pushing healthcare into more cost efficient and integrated outpatient settings. As a result, hospitals are reevaluating their business models to capture gains in efficiency. This push is driving medical procedures and other healthcare delivery, which has historically been conducted at a hospital, into outpatient settings via medical offices. Similarly, physicians and health systems are grouping together to increase their overhead efficiency and invest in new technology. Healthcare is increasingly being provided in part by nurses, physician assistants, and allied health providers -a key reason that healthcare is expected to be the fastest growing employment sector of this decade.

About Healthcare Trust of America, Inc.
Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE: HTA) is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that acquires, owns and operates medical office buildings. Since 2006, the company has invested over $6.8 billion in medical office buildings and other healthcare assets comprising more than 24 million square feet across 31 states.
HTA invests in key markets with above average growth and healthcare infrastructure that is capable of servicing long-term patient demand. Within each key market, HTA focuses on acquiring medical office buildings on health system campuses, in community-core locations, or near university medical centers. The portfolio consists of medical office buildings that are core-critical, a key part of the integrated delivery of healthcare, and that continue to complement the company's institutional asset management and leasing platform. HTA's business strategy is defined by establishing critical mass within key markets which allows HTA's asset management and in-house leasing platform to drive earnings growth, capitalize on synergies and maximize expense efficiencies, and build lasting tenant relationships which leads to retention, rent growth and long-term value creation across the portfolio.
Founded more than a decade ago in 2006, HTA has a consistent track record of generating stockholder returns that we believe have outperformed, the RMZ, S&P 500, and our direct MOB Peer. HTA listed its shares on the York Stock Exchange in June of 2012.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

About HTAHealthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE:    HTA) is the largest dedicated owner and operator of medical office buildings in the United States, based on gross leasable area.  We provide the real estate infrastructure for the integrated delivery of healthcare services in highly desirable locations.  Over the last decade, we have invested approximately $6.8 billion primarily in medical office buildings and other healthcare assets comprising over 24 million square feet of GLA.  Our investments are targeted in key markets that we believe have superior healthcare demographics that support strong, long-term demand for medical office space.  We have achieved, and continue to achieve, critical mass within these key markets by expanding our presence through accretive acquisitions, and utilizing our in-house operating expertise through our regionally located property management and leasing platform. 
Founded in 2006 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, HTA has produced attractive returns for its stockholders that we believe have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and US REIT indices.  More information about HTA can be found on the Company's website at www.htareit.com.
Forward-Looking LanguageThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs, including expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs about HTA, stockholder value and earnings growth.
The forward-looking statements included in this press release are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond HTA's control.  Although HTA believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, HTA's actual results and performance could differ materially and in adverse ways from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Factors which could have a material adverse effect on HTA's operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to:

changes in economic conditions affecting the healthcare property sector, the commercial real estate market and the credit market; 
competition for acquisition of medical office buildings and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry; 
economic fluctuations in certain states in which HTA's property investments are geographically concentrated; 
retention of HTA's senior management team; 
financial stability and solvency of HTA's tenants; 
supply and demand for operating properties in the market areas in which HTA operates; 
HTA's ability to acquire real properties, and to successfully operate those properties once acquired; 
changes in property taxes; 
legislative and regulatory changes, including changes to laws governing the taxation of REITs and changes to laws governing the healthcare industry; 
fluctuations in reimbursements from third party payors such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
changes in interest rates; 
the availability of capital and financing; 
restrictive covenants in HTA's credit facilities; 
changes in HTA's credit ratings; 
HTA's ability to remain qualified as a REIT; 
changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, policies and guidelines applicable to REITs; 
delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loan investments; and 
the risk factors set forth in HTA's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in HTA's most recent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.  Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, HTA undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect the events or circumstances arising after the date as of which they are made.  As a result of these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements included in this press release or that may be made elsewhere from time to time by, or on behalf of, HTA.

About Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. 
Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE: HTA) is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that acquires, owns and operates medical office buildings. Since 2006, the company has invested over $6.8 billion in medical office buildings and other healthcare assets comprising more than 24 million square feet across 31 states.
HTA invests in key markets with above average growth and healthcare infrastructure that is capable of servicing long-term patient demand. Within each key market, HTA focuses on acquiring medical office buildings on health system campuses, in community-core locations, or near university medical centers. The portfolio consists of medical office buildings that are core-critical, a key part of the integrated delivery of healthcare, and that continue to complement the company's institutional asset management and leasing platform. HTA's business strategy is defined by establishing critical mass within key markets which allows HTA's asset management and in-house leasing platform to drive earnings growth, capitalize on synergies and maximize expense efficiencies, and build lasting tenant relationships which leads to retention, rent growth and long-term value creation across the portfolio.
Founded more than a decade ago in 2006, HTA has a consistent track record of generating stockholder returns that we believe have outperformed, the RMZ, S&P 500, and our direct MOB Peer. HTA listed its shares on the York Stock Exchange in June of 2012.
