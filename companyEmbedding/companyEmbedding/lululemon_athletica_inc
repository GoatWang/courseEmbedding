History and management[edit]




The Lululemon Athletica store in Westport, Connecticut






Lululemon Athletica in Promenade


The company was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver, Canada.[3] In 2001, the company began selling yoga wear.[4] Christine Day, a former co-president of Starbucks International, became chief executive officer in June 2008. In December 2010, lululemon recalled some of the store's reusable bags that were made in China from polypropylene, based on reports of high levels of lead and concerns about possible lead poisoning.[5] In December 2013, founder Chip Wilson announced his resignation as chairman, and that president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, would become CEO.[6] In February 2014, the firm announced plans to open its first full store in Europe with a flagship shop in Covent Garden, London.[7] Day announced her departure as CEO in June 2013 after one of the company's core products, black Luon yoga pants, were pulled due to the sheerness and lack of quality of the pants.[8] In February 2015, Wilson announced that he resigned from the board.[9][10][11] Michael Casey, lead director of the board, replaced Wilson.[12] Store managers have responsibility for the store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.;[13] Seventy percent of managers are hired internally, according to a company source.[13] In March 2015, the store expanded its accommodation to men by introducing anti-ball crushing (ABC) pants, designed with additional latitude in the crotch region.[14]
lululemon murder[edit]
Main article: Lululemon murder
In 2011, employee Brittany Norwood murdered colleague Jayna Murray at the Lululemon Athletica store in Bethesda, Maryland.[15] The case received intense media attention and became known as the "lululemon murder".[15][16][17] This altercation began when Norwood attempted to steal a pair of lululemon's famous yoga pants. The scene quickly escalated and ultimately ended in the use of 5 different weapons and 331 different wounds on Jayna Murray which led to her death. [18]
Controversies[edit]
False advertising[edit]
In November 2007, The New York Times reported that Lululemon made false claims about its Vitasea clothing product; the firm had claimed that its Vitasea clothing, made from seaweed, provided "anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits" but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between cotton T-shirts and the fabric Vitasea.[19] lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the Competition Bureau of Canada.[20] A subsequent report in 2009 suggested that some yoga devotees saw the firm's yoga image as an "annoying phony-baloney symbol" with criticism that its "positive messaging" is vague with slogans such as "friends are more important than money."[3]
Product quality issues[edit]
There were complaints about shoddily made clothing which was "too sheer" as well as having holes appear and coming apart after a few uses.[21][22] In March 2013, lululemon was hit by a large recall of its black yoga pants that were unintentionally transparent and "too thin";[23][24] the recall, which amounted to approximately 17% of all women's pants sold in its stores, impacted its financial results.[25] lululemon's Chief Product Officer, Sheree Waterson, resigned following the fallout from the recall.[26] The financial hit on earnings, and damage to the public image of the Lululemon brand are credited with the executive's forced departure.[27]
Controversial statements by founder[edit]
Founder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements. He said his company does not make clothes for plus-size women because it costs too much money.[28] He blamed some customers for wearing lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes, in such a fashion as to cause small balls of twisted fabric to accumulate on the clothes, known as excessive pilling.[29] During his interview for Bloomberg TV in November 2013, he said, "Frankly some women's bodies just don't actually work for it" and "it's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it."[29] According to one report, comments such as these led to Wilson's resignation as chairman.[30] The statements were described in Time as "fat shaming" which led to much criticism among feminist blogs. The report suggested that it was company policy to discourage "plus-size customers" as part of its brand strategy since "no customer wants to endure the embarrassment of asking a clerk to go find a bigger size."[31]
In June 2016, Wilson published an open letter to shareholders of lululemon stating that lululemon has “lost its way” and given up market share to Nike and Under Armour, after he was denied the opportunity to speak at the company's annual meetings.[32][33][34]Since then, Wilson uses the website Elevate Lululemon to share his vision for the brand and business.[35] [36]
Legal disputes[edit]
In August 2012, lululemon filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[37] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that dismissed the suit.[38]

History and management[edit]




The Lululemon Athletica store in Westport, Connecticut






Lululemon Athletica in Promenade


The company was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver, Canada.[3] In 2001, the company began selling yoga wear.[4] Christine Day, a former co-president of Starbucks International, became chief executive officer in June 2008. In December 2010, lululemon recalled some of the store's reusable bags that were made in China from polypropylene, based on reports of high levels of lead and concerns about possible lead poisoning.[5] In December 2013, founder Chip Wilson announced his resignation as chairman, and that president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, would become CEO.[6] In February 2014, the firm announced plans to open its first full store in Europe with a flagship shop in Covent Garden, London.[7] Day announced her departure as CEO in June 2013 after one of the company's core products, black Luon yoga pants, were pulled due to the sheerness and lack of quality of the pants.[8] In February 2015, Wilson announced that he resigned from the board.[9][10][11] Michael Casey, lead director of the board, replaced Wilson.[12] Store managers have responsibility for the store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.;[13] Seventy percent of managers are hired internally, according to a company source.[13] In March 2015, the store expanded its accommodation to men by introducing anti-ball crushing (ABC) pants, designed with additional latitude in the crotch region.[14]
lululemon murder[edit]
Main article: Lululemon murder
In 2011, employee Brittany Norwood murdered colleague Jayna Murray at the Lululemon Athletica store in Bethesda, Maryland.[15] The case received intense media attention and became known as the "lululemon murder".[15][16][17] This altercation began when Norwood attempted to steal a pair of lululemon's famous yoga pants. The scene quickly escalated and ultimately ended in the use of 5 different weapons and 331 different wounds on Jayna Murray which led to her death. [18]
Controversies[edit]
False advertising[edit]
In November 2007, The New York Times reported that Lululemon made false claims about its Vitasea clothing product; the firm had claimed that its Vitasea clothing, made from seaweed, provided "anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits" but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between cotton T-shirts and the fabric Vitasea.[19] lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the Competition Bureau of Canada.[20] A subsequent report in 2009 suggested that some yoga devotees saw the firm's yoga image as an "annoying phony-baloney symbol" with criticism that its "positive messaging" is vague with slogans such as "friends are more important than money."[3]
Product quality issues[edit]
There were complaints about shoddily made clothing which was "too sheer" as well as having holes appear and coming apart after a few uses.[21][22] In March 2013, lululemon was hit by a large recall of its black yoga pants that were unintentionally transparent and "too thin";[23][24] the recall, which amounted to approximately 17% of all women's pants sold in its stores, impacted its financial results.[25] lululemon's Chief Product Officer, Sheree Waterson, resigned following the fallout from the recall.[26] The financial hit on earnings, and damage to the public image of the Lululemon brand are credited with the executive's forced departure.[27]
Controversial statements by founder[edit]
Founder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements. He said his company does not make clothes for plus-size women because it costs too much money.[28] He blamed some customers for wearing lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes, in such a fashion as to cause small balls of twisted fabric to accumulate on the clothes, known as excessive pilling.[29] During his interview for Bloomberg TV in November 2013, he said, "Frankly some women's bodies just don't actually work for it" and "it's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it."[29] According to one report, comments such as these led to Wilson's resignation as chairman.[30] The statements were described in Time as "fat shaming" which led to much criticism among feminist blogs. The report suggested that it was company policy to discourage "plus-size customers" as part of its brand strategy since "no customer wants to endure the embarrassment of asking a clerk to go find a bigger size."[31]
In June 2016, Wilson published an open letter to shareholders of lululemon stating that lululemon has “lost its way” and given up market share to Nike and Under Armour, after he was denied the opportunity to speak at the company's annual meetings.[32][33][34]Since then, Wilson uses the website Elevate Lululemon to share his vision for the brand and business.[35] [36]
Legal disputes[edit]
In August 2012, lululemon filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[37] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that dismissed the suit.[38]

History and management[edit]




The Lululemon Athletica store in Westport, Connecticut






Lululemon Athletica in Promenade


The company was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver, Canada.[3] In 2001, the company began selling yoga wear.[4] Christine Day, a former co-president of Starbucks International, became chief executive officer in June 2008. In December 2010, lululemon recalled some of the store's reusable bags that were made in China from polypropylene, based on reports of high levels of lead and concerns about possible lead poisoning.[5] In December 2013, founder Chip Wilson announced his resignation as chairman, and that president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, would become CEO.[6] In February 2014, the firm announced plans to open its first full store in Europe with a flagship shop in Covent Garden, London.[7] Day announced her departure as CEO in June 2013 after one of the company's core products, black Luon yoga pants, were pulled due to the sheerness and lack of quality of the pants.[8] In February 2015, Wilson announced that he resigned from the board.[9][10][11] Michael Casey, lead director of the board, replaced Wilson.[12] Store managers have responsibility for the store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.;[13] Seventy percent of managers are hired internally, according to a company source.[13] In March 2015, the store expanded its accommodation to men by introducing anti-ball crushing (ABC) pants, designed with additional latitude in the crotch region.[14]
lululemon murder[edit]
Main article: Lululemon murder
In 2011, employee Brittany Norwood murdered colleague Jayna Murray at the Lululemon Athletica store in Bethesda, Maryland.[15] The case received intense media attention and became known as the "lululemon murder".[15][16][17] This altercation began when Norwood attempted to steal a pair of lululemon's famous yoga pants. The scene quickly escalated and ultimately ended in the use of 5 different weapons and 331 different wounds on Jayna Murray which led to her death. [18]
Controversies[edit]
False advertising[edit]
In November 2007, The New York Times reported that Lululemon made false claims about its Vitasea clothing product; the firm had claimed that its Vitasea clothing, made from seaweed, provided "anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits" but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between cotton T-shirts and the fabric Vitasea.[19] lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the Competition Bureau of Canada.[20] A subsequent report in 2009 suggested that some yoga devotees saw the firm's yoga image as an "annoying phony-baloney symbol" with criticism that its "positive messaging" is vague with slogans such as "friends are more important than money."[3]
Product quality issues[edit]
There were complaints about shoddily made clothing which was "too sheer" as well as having holes appear and coming apart after a few uses.[21][22] In March 2013, lululemon was hit by a large recall of its black yoga pants that were unintentionally transparent and "too thin";[23][24] the recall, which amounted to approximately 17% of all women's pants sold in its stores, impacted its financial results.[25] lululemon's Chief Product Officer, Sheree Waterson, resigned following the fallout from the recall.[26] The financial hit on earnings, and damage to the public image of the Lululemon brand are credited with the executive's forced departure.[27]
Controversial statements by founder[edit]
Founder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements. He said his company does not make clothes for plus-size women because it costs too much money.[28] He blamed some customers for wearing lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes, in such a fashion as to cause small balls of twisted fabric to accumulate on the clothes, known as excessive pilling.[29] During his interview for Bloomberg TV in November 2013, he said, "Frankly some women's bodies just don't actually work for it" and "it's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it."[29] According to one report, comments such as these led to Wilson's resignation as chairman.[30] The statements were described in Time as "fat shaming" which led to much criticism among feminist blogs. The report suggested that it was company policy to discourage "plus-size customers" as part of its brand strategy since "no customer wants to endure the embarrassment of asking a clerk to go find a bigger size."[31]
In June 2016, Wilson published an open letter to shareholders of lululemon stating that lululemon has “lost its way” and given up market share to Nike and Under Armour, after he was denied the opportunity to speak at the company's annual meetings.[32][33][34]Since then, Wilson uses the website Elevate Lululemon to share his vision for the brand and business.[35] [36]
Legal disputes[edit]
In August 2012, lululemon filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[37] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that dismissed the suit.[38]

The Lululemon Athletica store in Westport, Connecticut






Lululemon Athletica in Promenade


The company was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver, Canada.[3] In 2001, the company began selling yoga wear.[4] Christine Day, a former co-president of Starbucks International, became chief executive officer in June 2008. In December 2010, lululemon recalled some of the store's reusable bags that were made in China from polypropylene, based on reports of high levels of lead and concerns about possible lead poisoning.[5] In December 2013, founder Chip Wilson announced his resignation as chairman, and that president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, would become CEO.[6] In February 2014, the firm announced plans to open its first full store in Europe with a flagship shop in Covent Garden, London.[7] Day announced her departure as CEO in June 2013 after one of the company's core products, black Luon yoga pants, were pulled due to the sheerness and lack of quality of the pants.[8] In February 2015, Wilson announced that he resigned from the board.[9][10][11] Michael Casey, lead director of the board, replaced Wilson.[12] Store managers have responsibility for the store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.;[13] Seventy percent of managers are hired internally, according to a company source.[13] In March 2015, the store expanded its accommodation to men by introducing anti-ball crushing (ABC) pants, designed with additional latitude in the crotch region.[14]
lululemon murder[edit]
Main article: Lululemon murder
In 2011, employee Brittany Norwood murdered colleague Jayna Murray at the Lululemon Athletica store in Bethesda, Maryland.[15] The case received intense media attention and became known as the "lululemon murder".[15][16][17] This altercation began when Norwood attempted to steal a pair of lululemon's famous yoga pants. The scene quickly escalated and ultimately ended in the use of 5 different weapons and 331 different wounds on Jayna Murray which led to her death. [18]
Controversies[edit]
False advertising[edit]
In November 2007, The New York Times reported that Lululemon made false claims about its Vitasea clothing product; the firm had claimed that its Vitasea clothing, made from seaweed, provided "anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits" but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between cotton T-shirts and the fabric Vitasea.[19] lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the Competition Bureau of Canada.[20] A subsequent report in 2009 suggested that some yoga devotees saw the firm's yoga image as an "annoying phony-baloney symbol" with criticism that its "positive messaging" is vague with slogans such as "friends are more important than money."[3]
Product quality issues[edit]
There were complaints about shoddily made clothing which was "too sheer" as well as having holes appear and coming apart after a few uses.[21][22] In March 2013, lululemon was hit by a large recall of its black yoga pants that were unintentionally transparent and "too thin";[23][24] the recall, which amounted to approximately 17% of all women's pants sold in its stores, impacted its financial results.[25] lululemon's Chief Product Officer, Sheree Waterson, resigned following the fallout from the recall.[26] The financial hit on earnings, and damage to the public image of the Lululemon brand are credited with the executive's forced departure.[27]
Controversial statements by founder[edit]
Founder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements. He said his company does not make clothes for plus-size women because it costs too much money.[28] He blamed some customers for wearing lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes, in such a fashion as to cause small balls of twisted fabric to accumulate on the clothes, known as excessive pilling.[29] During his interview for Bloomberg TV in November 2013, he said, "Frankly some women's bodies just don't actually work for it" and "it's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it."[29] According to one report, comments such as these led to Wilson's resignation as chairman.[30] The statements were described in Time as "fat shaming" which led to much criticism among feminist blogs. The report suggested that it was company policy to discourage "plus-size customers" as part of its brand strategy since "no customer wants to endure the embarrassment of asking a clerk to go find a bigger size."[31]
In June 2016, Wilson published an open letter to shareholders of lululemon stating that lululemon has “lost its way” and given up market share to Nike and Under Armour, after he was denied the opportunity to speak at the company's annual meetings.[32][33][34]Since then, Wilson uses the website Elevate Lululemon to share his vision for the brand and business.[35] [36]
Legal disputes[edit]
In August 2012, lululemon filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[37] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that dismissed the suit.[38]

History and management[edit]




The Lululemon Athletica store in Westport, Connecticut






Lululemon Athletica in Promenade


The company was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver, Canada.[3] In 2001, the company began selling yoga wear.[4] Christine Day, a former co-president of Starbucks International, became chief executive officer in June 2008. In December 2010, lululemon recalled some of the store's reusable bags that were made in China from polypropylene, based on reports of high levels of lead and concerns about possible lead poisoning.[5] In December 2013, founder Chip Wilson announced his resignation as chairman, and that president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, would become CEO.[6] In February 2014, the firm announced plans to open its first full store in Europe with a flagship shop in Covent Garden, London.[7] Day announced her departure as CEO in June 2013 after one of the company's core products, black Luon yoga pants, were pulled due to the sheerness and lack of quality of the pants.[8] In February 2015, Wilson announced that he resigned from the board.[9][10][11] Michael Casey, lead director of the board, replaced Wilson.[12] Store managers have responsibility for the store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.;[13] Seventy percent of managers are hired internally, according to a company source.[13] In March 2015, the store expanded its accommodation to men by introducing anti-ball crushing (ABC) pants, designed with additional latitude in the crotch region.[14]
lululemon murder[edit]
Main article: Lululemon murder
In 2011, employee Brittany Norwood murdered colleague Jayna Murray at the Lululemon Athletica store in Bethesda, Maryland.[15] The case received intense media attention and became known as the "lululemon murder".[15][16][17] This altercation began when Norwood attempted to steal a pair of lululemon's famous yoga pants. The scene quickly escalated and ultimately ended in the use of 5 different weapons and 331 different wounds on Jayna Murray which led to her death. [18]
Controversies[edit]
False advertising[edit]
In November 2007, The New York Times reported that Lululemon made false claims about its Vitasea clothing product; the firm had claimed that its Vitasea clothing, made from seaweed, provided "anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits" but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between cotton T-shirts and the fabric Vitasea.[19] lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the Competition Bureau of Canada.[20] A subsequent report in 2009 suggested that some yoga devotees saw the firm's yoga image as an "annoying phony-baloney symbol" with criticism that its "positive messaging" is vague with slogans such as "friends are more important than money."[3]
Product quality issues[edit]
There were complaints about shoddily made clothing which was "too sheer" as well as having holes appear and coming apart after a few uses.[21][22] In March 2013, lululemon was hit by a large recall of its black yoga pants that were unintentionally transparent and "too thin";[23][24] the recall, which amounted to approximately 17% of all women's pants sold in its stores, impacted its financial results.[25] lululemon's Chief Product Officer, Sheree Waterson, resigned following the fallout from the recall.[26] The financial hit on earnings, and damage to the public image of the Lululemon brand are credited with the executive's forced departure.[27]
Controversial statements by founder[edit]
Founder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements. He said his company does not make clothes for plus-size women because it costs too much money.[28] He blamed some customers for wearing lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes, in such a fashion as to cause small balls of twisted fabric to accumulate on the clothes, known as excessive pilling.[29] During his interview for Bloomberg TV in November 2013, he said, "Frankly some women's bodies just don't actually work for it" and "it's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it."[29] According to one report, comments such as these led to Wilson's resignation as chairman.[30] The statements were described in Time as "fat shaming" which led to much criticism among feminist blogs. The report suggested that it was company policy to discourage "plus-size customers" as part of its brand strategy since "no customer wants to endure the embarrassment of asking a clerk to go find a bigger size."[31]
In June 2016, Wilson published an open letter to shareholders of lululemon stating that lululemon has “lost its way” and given up market share to Nike and Under Armour, after he was denied the opportunity to speak at the company's annual meetings.[32][33][34]Since then, Wilson uses the website Elevate Lululemon to share his vision for the brand and business.[35] [36]
Legal disputes[edit]
In August 2012, lululemon filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[37] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that dismissed the suit.[38]

History and management[edit]




The Lululemon Athletica store in Westport, Connecticut






Lululemon Athletica in Promenade


The company was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver, Canada.[3] In 2001, the company began selling yoga wear.[4] Christine Day, a former co-president of Starbucks International, became chief executive officer in June 2008. In December 2010, lululemon recalled some of the store's reusable bags that were made in China from polypropylene, based on reports of high levels of lead and concerns about possible lead poisoning.[5] In December 2013, founder Chip Wilson announced his resignation as chairman, and that president of TOMS Shoes, Laurent Potdevin, would become CEO.[6] In February 2014, the firm announced plans to open its first full store in Europe with a flagship shop in Covent Garden, London.[7] Day announced her departure as CEO in June 2013 after one of the company's core products, black Luon yoga pants, were pulled due to the sheerness and lack of quality of the pants.[8] In February 2015, Wilson announced that he resigned from the board.[9][10][11] Michael Casey, lead director of the board, replaced Wilson.[12] Store managers have responsibility for the store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.;[13] Seventy percent of managers are hired internally, according to a company source.[13] In March 2015, the store expanded its accommodation to men by introducing anti-ball crushing (ABC) pants, designed with additional latitude in the crotch region.[14]
lululemon murder[edit]
Main article: Lululemon murder
In 2011, employee Brittany Norwood murdered colleague Jayna Murray at the Lululemon Athletica store in Bethesda, Maryland.[15] The case received intense media attention and became known as the "lululemon murder".[15][16][17] This altercation began when Norwood attempted to steal a pair of lululemon's famous yoga pants. The scene quickly escalated and ultimately ended in the use of 5 different weapons and 331 different wounds on Jayna Murray which led to her death. [18]
Controversies[edit]
False advertising[edit]
In November 2007, The New York Times reported that Lululemon made false claims about its Vitasea clothing product; the firm had claimed that its Vitasea clothing, made from seaweed, provided "anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits" but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between cotton T-shirts and the fabric Vitasea.[19] lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the Competition Bureau of Canada.[20] A subsequent report in 2009 suggested that some yoga devotees saw the firm's yoga image as an "annoying phony-baloney symbol" with criticism that its "positive messaging" is vague with slogans such as "friends are more important than money."[3]
Product quality issues[edit]
There were complaints about shoddily made clothing which was "too sheer" as well as having holes appear and coming apart after a few uses.[21][22] In March 2013, lululemon was hit by a large recall of its black yoga pants that were unintentionally transparent and "too thin";[23][24] the recall, which amounted to approximately 17% of all women's pants sold in its stores, impacted its financial results.[25] lululemon's Chief Product Officer, Sheree Waterson, resigned following the fallout from the recall.[26] The financial hit on earnings, and damage to the public image of the Lululemon brand are credited with the executive's forced departure.[27]
Controversial statements by founder[edit]
Founder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements. He said his company does not make clothes for plus-size women because it costs too much money.[28] He blamed some customers for wearing lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes, in such a fashion as to cause small balls of twisted fabric to accumulate on the clothes, known as excessive pilling.[29] During his interview for Bloomberg TV in November 2013, he said, "Frankly some women's bodies just don't actually work for it" and "it's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it."[29] According to one report, comments such as these led to Wilson's resignation as chairman.[30] The statements were described in Time as "fat shaming" which led to much criticism among feminist blogs. The report suggested that it was company policy to discourage "plus-size customers" as part of its brand strategy since "no customer wants to endure the embarrassment of asking a clerk to go find a bigger size."[31]
In June 2016, Wilson published an open letter to shareholders of lululemon stating that lululemon has “lost its way” and given up market share to Nike and Under Armour, after he was denied the opportunity to speak at the company's annual meetings.[32][33][34]Since then, Wilson uses the website Elevate Lululemon to share his vision for the brand and business.[35] [36]
Legal disputes[edit]
In August 2012, lululemon filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[37] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that dismissed the suit.[38]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Lululemon Athletica Inc Issues Another Product Recall -- Should Investors Be Worried?
The yoga stylist attracted headlines with another product recall, but this is nothing compared to the pants recall of 2013.











                Jeremy Bowman
            

                (TMFHobo)



            
            Jul 8, 2015 at 7:39AM
            
            





After a forgettable couple of years that were marked by a massive pants recall, Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) shares are up more than 60% in the past year as sales growth has returned.
However, now another product recall threatens the brand image once again. Late last month, the yoga specialist issued a recall for over 300,000 of its hooded tops due to incidents in which the elastic cord was whipping the wearer in the face when pulled or caught on something. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said seven people had reported injuries to the face and eyes in its recall announcement.

Unlike the previous product recall, Lululemon said the financial impact from the cord issue will not be material, and as a remedy, customers could either remove the cord from the top or request a non-elastic replacement cord in-store or via mail. In a statement, the company said, "Our main priority is ensuring our product works for our guests, and we believe this is the necessary proactive action. We assessed and accrued for the financial impact ... and do not consider this to be material to our business."
Not all recalls are created equalThough the recall headline may scare investors, this is a much different situation than the previous one, which involved its trademark luon pants being too sheer. That manufacturing error caused the company to not only recall thousands of pairs of pants but to also pull an estimated 17% of its pants inventory from stores at the time of the announcement in March 2013, leading to a supply shortage and a decrease of around $60 million in sales and $0.25 in earnings per share.  
Subsequent setbacks for the company included the surprise resignation of CEO Christine Day and offensive remarks about women from founder Chip Wilson. Wilson is no longer involved with the company, having sold the remainder of his stock earlier this year, and new CEO Laurent Potdevin has settled into his role with the company beating earnings expectations in the last four quarters as the stock has recovered. 





The scale of this recall is much smaller than the pants incident as this only affects the drawstring, and only seven incidents have been reported. In the case of the sheer pants, thousands of customers may have been unaware that their bottoms were too see-through, which led to significant public backlash. 
Challenges are still aheadWhile the stock price has moved up from its lows last year, the company is still facing challenges. Earnings per share is expected to be nearly flat this year due in part to a stronger dollar and thinner margins, caused by changes in product mix and increased manufacturing costs. 
Still, the company is in the best shape it has been since the pants debacle, thanks in part to growth in its men's segment and e-commerce. Online sales jumped 31% in the most recent quarter and has been a consistent engine of growth since it was introduced several years ago. Sales of men's gear increased 19% on a comparable basis, and its ivivva stores, which sell dance-inspired clothes for girls also performed well in the quarter with a 29% increase in total comparable sales, which includes online business.  
For investors, the bottom line here is that the elastic cord recall should not be a concern and is unlikely to affect performance. Because it is such a small item, the replacement costs are minimal, and though the news may be embarrassing considering the controversy in 2013, this is a minor hiccup, and Lululemon's overall momentum should not be affected.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
