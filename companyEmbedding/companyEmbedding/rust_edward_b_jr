      ■ Like his grandfather and father before him, Edward B. Rust Jr.
      became the chairman and chief executive officer of State Farm Insurance
      Companies. Having been associated with the company his entire life, Rust
      was well steeped in the mutual insurer's corporate culture, which
      placed a great deal of emphasis on serving policyholders, who were the
      legal owners of the company, and avoiding spending money unnecessarily.
      However, despite a lifelong association with State Farm, Rust maintained
      that growing up in the Midwest and learning rural values provided a moral
      foundation that would become more important to his achieving success as a
      chief executive. One of those values was respect for education. Rust, who
      held advanced degrees in business administration and law, became devoted
      to the advancement of education in America and instrumental in State
      Farm's contributions in this area, in terms of both money and the
      time of its employees. Rust served as a trustee of his alma mater,
      Illinois Wesleyan University, and was a member of the Business Advisory
      Council of the University of Illinois College of Commerce and Business
      Administration as well as a member of the advisory council of the Stanford
      University Graduate School of Business. In addition, he was the cochairman
      of the Business Coalition for Excellence in Education and was a member of
      President George W. Bush's transition advisory team on education.
    

      DEEP FAMILY TIES TO STATE FARM
    

      When Rust was born in 1950 in Chicago, his family was already deeply
      involved in the affairs of State Farm. The company was founded in 1922 by
      George J. Mecherle of Bloomington, Illinois. His idea was to form a mutual
      insurance company for rural and small-town drivers, who paid higher
      premiums than urban drivers despite having fewer accidents. By linking
      insurance rates to risk levels, Mecherle was able to offer much lower
      premiums than his competitors. He also signed agreements with the state
      farm bureaus, which received a fee for each of their members who purchased
      policies—hence the State Farm name. State Farm soon covered city
      drivers as well and in 1929 added life insurance. By 1942 State Farm was
      the largest auto insurer in the country. Rust's grandfather, Adlai
      H. Rust, was a young lawyer when he helped Mecherle found State Farm and
      became his right-hand man. Mecherle's son, Raymond, took over the
      presidency of the company in 1937, and when Raymond died in 1954, Adlai
      Rust took over as chief executive officer. His son, Edward B. Rust Sr.,
      joined State Farm in 1941, succeeded him as CEO in 1967, and was named
      chairman in 1983.
    

      According to Edward Rust Jr., his goal while growing up was not one day to
      work for State Farm. Rather he focused on his education, which was a point
      of emphasis in his family. His father graduated cum laude from Stanford
      University, majoring in economics, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. His
      mother, Harriett Fuller Rust, graduated with honors from the University of
      Southern California. Rust received his under-graduate degree in 1972 from
      Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, where he was a two-year
      starting guard in football and became an accomplished wrestler. He then
      went on to Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, earning a
      master of business administration and a law degree. Rust told 
      
        Best's Review
      
       in a December 1996 article that going to work at State Farm was not on
      his mind while completing his education: "It was not until I got
      out of law school, and, frankly,
       had a couple good offers from law firms, that I decided to give State
      Farm a try."
    

      Rust stayed in Dallas and in 1975 became a State Farm management trainee
      at the local office. After gaining an overview of how regional operations
      were handled, he returned home to Bloomington to become an attorney in the
      State Farm corporate law department. He next became involved in marketing
      and sales before finally moving into general management. In 1981 he made
      vice president and in 1983 was appointed executive vice president and
      chief operating officer and named a director. Rust maintained that
      "being the boss's son was no guaranteed ticket to
      success" (
      
        Best's Review
      
      , December 1996). In fact, being the subject of expectations from older
      generations was often a difficult burden to bear. He was also quick to
      note that he owed a debt to a number of mentors beyond his father and
      grandfather.
    

      RUST SR. DIES IN OFFICE
    

      In August 1985 Rust's father died at the age of 66 and his
      namesake, only 35 years old, was promptly appointed the new chief
      executive officer. According to a 
      
        Fortune
      
       profile of State Farm, insiders at the company almost took the younger
      Rust's promotion for granted. However, outside directors, mostly
      academics and economists, gave some thought to conducting a national
      search to bring in someone with a prestigious background: "These
      directors knew Ed Sr. as very private, disciplined, and brilliant. They
      knew the son as more outgoing but unproved as a businessman" (April
      8, 1991). The idea of looking elsewhere was quickly dismissed, however,
      and Rust was named to the post. He soon proved that despite his age, he
      was up to the job and two years later, in 1987, was named chairman of the
      board.
    

      After nearly a decade heading State Farm, Rust outlined to 
      
        Fortune
      
       what made a top executive, observations that were a reflection of his own
      management style and core values. He said, "You have to live and
      breathe the business, always exploring new horizons and learning to
      understand the ever changing world around us" (April 8, 1991). At
      the same time, Rust emphasized the need to surround oneself with capable
      people and to have the confidence to delegate authority to them. He also
      expressed the importance of striking a balance between a personal and work
      life. As for his role at State Farm, Rust narrowed it down to two areas:
      "The first is the development of people, and the second is an
      untiring effort to better understand the marketplace, how customer demands
      are changing" (
      
        Best's Review
      
      , December 1996).
    

      With Rust's family fortunes so intertwined with State Farm's
      history, it was difficult clearly to distinguish the corporate culture
      from the CEO's personal worldview. The insurer remained
      conservative in its approach to business, essentially content to continue
      selling reasonably priced auto and home insurance. In the words of one
      industry analyst quoted in a 1999 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       article, "They don't throw the long bomb; they just move
      the ball ahead slowly and steadily" ("Father Knew
      Best—and So Did Grandfather," November 8, 1999). The company
      was so committed to controlling costs in the name of its policyholders
      that its corporate culture appeared to take on the zeal of religion, and
      to many it went too far. In 1989 State Farm was accused in a policyholder
      lawsuit of being too conservative in maintaining reserves, with the effect
      of trimming dividend payments to policyholders.
    

      LEGAL PROBLEMS TROUBLE STATE FARM
    

      During the 1990s Rust would face a number of legal problems that critics
      said were an outgrowth of State Farm's inbred culture and obsession
      with cost controls. A 1994 earthquake in the Los Angeles area led to
      lawsuits by homeowners, who charged that the company had secretly reduced
      their earthquake coverage. The matter was settled in 1997, when State Farm
      agreed to make $100 million in payments. In 1998 State Farm was
      "rocked by a string of blistering punitive damage
      decisions," as reported by 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       ("State Farm: What's Happening to the Good
      Neighbor?" November 8, 1999). As the article noted, in Utah the
      company was fined $25 million in punitive damages, in part for the
      "systematic destruction of documents" and "systematic
      manipulation of individual claim files to conceal claim
      mishandling." An Idaho appeals court then fined the company $9.5
      million in punitive damages for making use of "a completely
      bogus" outside bill-review company that helped lower the cost of
      medical claims. In October 1999 an Illinois jury rendered a $456 million
      judgment against State Farm. That amount was then stiffened by an
      additional $730 million in punitive and other damages awarded by the judge
      for the insurer's breach of contract with auto policyholders by
      relying on generic replacement parts. Although the case revealed a number
      of damning internal documents, Rust was adamant in his insistence that
      State Farm had not committed fraud. A trained lawyer, Rust made his
      opinion of the current state of the court system a matter of public
      record. In 1995 he spoke before the Appellate Lawyers Association,
      outlining his belief that the civil justice system had undergone a
      fundamental shift in the years following World War II: "It has gone
      from a fault-based to a pseudo-compensation-based system" (
      
        Vital Speeches of the Day
      
      , September 15, 2003). In his opinion, this change was in many ways a
      reflection of people's decreased willingness to accept
      responsibility for their actions. Moreover, lawsuits were becoming viewed
      "a bit like a lottery," with a large number of people
      looking to turn misfortune into a jackpot. At a lower level, people were
      more willing than ever to pad insurance claims, but even this activity, he
      said, was fraud. It was not the insurance company that would foot the
      bill, of course; the policyholder would pay because in the end, it was the
      policyholder's money that was at stake. In the corporate
       culture of State Farm with which Rust so identified, protecting the
      interests of the policyholder was sacrosanct.
    

      A COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION
    

      While conservative business practices and a devotion to keeping a tight
      rein on policyholders' money were core values that Rust had
      essentially inherited from his forebears at State Farm, his devotion to
      advancing education was very much his contribution to the company's
      culture. Starting in 1995 State Farm offered its more than 75,000
      employees one paid day off each year to offer help at a school, whether
      that help involve accompanying a class on a field trip or providing expert
      advice to school administrators. In 1997 State Farm became involved with
      the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, a teacher-founded
      organization that sought to improve the quality of teaching and to provide
      certification. Moreover, State Farm provided funds for new buildings,
      fellowships, and other programs at colleges and universities across the
      country as well as support for the Beyond the Books Educational
      Foundation, which provided grants to elementary and secondary teachers for
      special projects that could not be funded at the local level.
      Rust's personal commitment to education was also evident in his
      willingness to serve as a trustee and adviser to Illinois Wesleyan
      University, the University of Illinois, and Stanford University as well as
      serving as the cochairman of the Business Coalition for Excellence in
      Education and on President Bush's transition team covering
      educational issues.
    

      With the start of the 21st century, Rust faced a number of challenges in
      leading State Farm into the future. The insurance industry was adversely
      impacted by a string of events: asbestos claims, the sudden drop in the
      stock market, Enron and other corporate scandals, and the uncertainty that
      resulted from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. While some were
      short-term problems, others carried long-term implications for the
      insurance industry. How Rust would be able to guide State Farm through
      this period of great uncertainty remained to be seen.

E.b. Rust, 66, Head Of State Farm - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



E.b. Rust, 66, Head Of State FarmAugust 19, 1985Edward B. Rust, chief executive officer of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and its affiliates, died Sunday in St. Joseph`s Hospital in Bloomington, Ill. He was 66 years old.Mr. Rust joined the company in 1941 and became president of its parent company, State Farm Mutual, in 1958. He added the title of board chairman in 1983 and was president and chief executive officer of the seven State Farm affiliates that write property-casualty and life insurance coverage.During Mr. Rust`s tenure the company became the largest property-casualty insurance group in the world, and he was called upon by public and private agencies as an adviser in American foreign and domestic affairs.He was president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 1973-74 and was a former member of the Housing and Urban Development Advisory Committee on Riot Insurance, the Department of Commerce National Business Council for Consumer Affairs and President Nixon`s Minority Enterprises Advisory Council. He visited the Soviet Union and the Middle East as a member of U.S. business delegations.A native of Bloomington, Mr. Rust was graduated cum laude in 1940 from Stanford University with a degree in economics. During World War II he served with the U.S. Navy in the Aleutians and taught in the naval supply school at Harvard University. After the war he became director of branch offices for State Farm and created 24 regional offices in the United States and one in Canada.When Mr. Rust assumed responsibility for the branch offices, there was one in Bloomington and one on the West Coast, said Ron Arnold, vice president for public relations at State Farm. The semiautonomous regional offices developed as business increased in a geographical area, Arnold said.He summarized Mr. Rust`s business philosophy as, ``The product has to be good or you don`t have a good company.``Mr. Rust received honorary degrees from Illinois Wesleyan University in 1974, Illinois State University in 1982 and Lincoln College in 1983.He is survived by his wife, Harriet; two daughters, Holly and Peggy; a son, Edward B. Jr.; a sister; a half-brother; and 12 grandchildren.Services will be held at 11 a.m. Wednesday in the Second Presbyterian Church in Bloomington.

State Farm counsel Roland Spies' participation on ALEC2011年4月1日 15:28I sent the following letter off to Ed Rust, Jr., CEO of State Farm, today, cc:ed to Roland Spies, and emailed to the State Farm Wisconsin media contact, Ann Avery.  It's self-explanatory. April 1, 2011 Mr. Edward B. Rust, Jr., CEOState Farm Insurance1 State Farm PlazaBloomington, IL 61701 Dear Mr. Rust - I, along with my family, am a long-time State Farm customer.  My parents, Lowell and MabelHokin, were State Farm customers from before I was born in 1960, and I've been a State Farmcustomer since I bought my first car, a used 1965 Volkswagen, in 1977.  I always recommend StateFarm to friends.  I like the mutual insurance business model, and I like the agents.  I've always feltthat, more than any other insurance company, State Farm is primarily concerned with its customers,rather than corporate profits.  After all, we customers are shareholders, and we benefit in part fromthose profits as well. However, something has recently come to my attention that has drawn my patronage of State Farminto question.  Namely, the right-wing legislative group American Legislative Exchange Council(ALEC), which consists of state legislators and private-sector executives, has, on its PrivateEnterprise Board, a State Farm executive: Mr. Roland Spies, who works as counsel in theBloomington office.  In fact, if you Google "Roland Spies State Farm", you will find a plethora ofsearch results pointing to pages in which Mr Spies' participation on the ALEC Private EnterpriseBoard is noted. As I'm sure you know, many Wisconsin citizens like me are fighting a political battle against theanti-worker and anti-family agenda of Governor Scott Walker and his Republican Senate andAssembly cohorts.  Recently, a University of Wisconsin historian, Prof. William Cronon, publishedresearch revealing that several of the legislative bills introduced by Wisonsin Republican legislatorswere actually drafted by ALEC.  In response, the Wisconsin Republican Party launched an attack onProf. Cronon using open records law to attempt to retreive all of his UW emails.  Needless to say,this has greatly raised public awareness of ALEC, its association with Wisconsin Republicans, andState Farm's association with ALEC through Mr. Spies' membership on the ALEC PrivateEnterprise Board. As the founder of the Facebook page "Boycott Scott Walker Contributors", which is over 23,000strong as of today, I am now being asked regularly whether a national boycott of State Farm shouldbe advocated due to Mr Spies' participation on ALEC, and its implied association of State Farmwith right-wing legislation.  Up to now, I've said "I need to see what the State Farm CEO Ed Rusthas to say about this."  So, that is the purpose of this letter.  There are 23,000 people in Wisconsinplus other states, waiting to hear from me on this issue.  I've promised to contact you, and I'vepromised to make a State Farm boycott recommendation based on your response. As a longtime State Farm member (not as the founder of the Facebook page), I demand that StateFarm ask Mr Spies to either resign from ALEC, or clearly disassociate himself from State Farm inhis ALEC activities.  I demand that State Farm no longer appear on ALEC's Private EnterpriseBoard page.  ALEC is an anti-labor, anti-family, anti-teacher and, frankly, anti-democraticorganization that is bent on destroying the way of life that State Farm members, and, I think, StateFarm executive leadership, hold dear.  Mr Spies is, of course, free to join any right-wing group thathe likes, but he should do so strictly as a private citizen and NOT as a representative of State Farm.If he remains on the ALEC Private Enterprise Board, he must insist that they remove his associationwith State Farm from the listing, and, rather, list him simply as a private citizen. I look forward to hearing an official, public announcement from you on this.  Many, many otherState Farm members here in Wisconsin await it.  I hope to hear from you within two weeks,  byApril 15.  You may choose to not make a public statement, and simply reply to me, and I will makeyour reply public, just as I am making this letter to you public by publishing it on my Facebookpage. Absent a clear dissociation of State Farm from ALEC, we will be forced to take our businesselsewhere, in a well-publicized boycott, and we will urge all State Farm members, throughout thecountry, to take their business elsewhere as well.  We will not support a company that, evenindirectly, lends legitimacy to an abhorrent organization like ALEC.  ALEC is waging war on everyideal that State Farm members hold dear, and there simply cannot be any connection between StateFarm and ALEC. Thank you very much for considering this carefully, and considering the positive impact of taking astand against Mr Spies participation on the ALEC Private Enterprise Board of Directors in his roleas a State Farm executive.  State Farm members will applaud you for standing up for their interests,rather than the interests of corporations and their owners. Sincerely, Samuel HokinMadison, WI Founder, Facebook page "Boycott Scott Walker Contributors" cc: Mr. Roland Spies, State Farm Counselcc: Ms. Ann Avery, State Farm
