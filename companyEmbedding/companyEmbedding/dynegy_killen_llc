Dynegy Pays $6.3B for Power Plants









Claire Poole




Aug 22, 2014 12:09 PM EDT













 




























































 HOUSTON ( The Deal) -- Houston power producer Dynegy ( DYN)  said Friday it agreed to buy power plants and retail electricity businesses from Duke Energy ( DUK)  and private equity firm Energy Capital Partners, or ECP, for $6.25 billion, doubling its generating capacity to 26,000 megawatts and giving it retail operations in three new states.   Dynegy is paying $2.8 billion for Duke's assets and $3.45 billion for ECP's.   The Duke portfolio includes its retail business and ownership interests in the Killen, Stuart, Conesville, Miami Fort, Zimmer, Hanging Rock, Washington, Fayette, Lee and Dicks Creek power plants.   The ECP assets that make up the sale of EquiPower Resources Corp. and Brayton Point Holdings LLC include the Milford, Lake Road, Dighton, Masspower, Liberty, Elwood, Richland, Stryker, Kincaid and Brayton Point power plants.   The deal will allow Dynegy to provide retail electricity to residents and businesses in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan, along with Illinois, with the ECP and Duke Ohio generation assets providing the generation to support the businesses.   Dynegy CEO and president Robert Flexon said in a statement the plants transform Dynegy by adding considerable scale in the PJM Interconnection LLC and New England markets.   "The addition of these portfolios is forecasted to significantly improve our financial outlook by tripling our 2015 adjusted Ebitda and being massively accretive to adjusted Ebitda and free cash flow per share in 2015 and beyond," he said.   Flexon added that Dynegy intends to honor the terms of the collective bargaining agreements in both generating fleets. The company also intends to honor ECP's agreement to retire the Brayton Point coal plant on May 31, 2017 and complete the decommissioning after retirement.   Marc Manly, president of Duke's commercial business, said the transaction is an important milestone in its strategy to exit the merchant generation business.   In the third quarter Duke expects to book a $500 million pre-tax reversal of the $1.4 billion impairment previously recognized in 2014. It said use of the proceeds "is being evaluated" but it expects the transaction to be accretive to shareholders by 2016.   Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities Inc. said the deal metrics look "very good' at 5 times next year's enterprise value to Ebitda, especially considering that Dynegy is looking to capture $500 million in cash tax savings through the use of its large net operating loss position and sees $40 million in annual synergies. The firm added that it will be interesting to see where the pricing falls on the $5 billion in new notes Dynegy will issue to finance the deals.   Industry observers had expressed concern about Duke's auction process when Arlington, Va.-based AES ( AES)  pulled back on selling the power plants and retail electricity businesses that made up DPL Inc., deciding instead to separate out the businesses as required by regulators. Industry experts had expected the business to fetch as much as $2.6 billion in an auction led by Barclays.   But sources told The Deal in early August that Duke was on track to complete a sale, which industry bankers estimated would fetch $2 billion to $2.3 billion. The Deal had previously expected Dynegy to be one of the bidders for Duke's assets, along with the Blackstone Group LP, Riverstone Holdings LLC, Energy Investors Funds and ECP.   Paul Patterson, a longtime utility and power analyst at Glenrock Associates LLC, said the deal wasn't all that surprising. "The more of these deals take place, you have to wonder how much will remain to be done," he said. "A key factor could be the desire on the part of hybrid utilities to shed their non-regulated businesses."   Dynegy said the addition of ECP's and Duke's assets complement Dynegy's existing assets and retail business by adding significant scale and fuel diversification in markets in which the company participates but lacks scale.   Of the 12,500 megawatts being acquired, Dynegy said 5,053 megwatts are "modern" combined cycle natural gas plants and 3,793 megawatts are "environmentally compliant" coal generation plants.   Dynegy said the deals will quadruple the size of its PJM fleet and boost its New England fleet seven-fold and will be 125% Ebitda accretive and 220% free cash flow accretive next year.   Dynegy expects the combined enterprise to generate $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in Ebitda and $480 million to $680 million in free cash flow, assuming both deals close by the end of the year.   Dynegy also said its $3.2 billion net operating loss position will be available to offset taxable income of the combined company, providing nearly $500 million in present value cash tax savings.

        approximately 125% and 220%.
      

        Duke Energy Retail adds over 7 terawatt-hours of annual retail load in

            total Dynegy Inc. revolver capacity to $1.425 billion.
          








August 22, 2014 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN) has signed two separate definitive sets of 
      agreements to acquire the ownership interests in certain Midwest 
      generation assets from Duke Energy and EquiPower Resources Corp and 
      Brayton Point Holdings, LLC from ECP. The Duke portfolio includes its 
      retail business and ownership interests in the following plants: Killen, 
      Stuart, Conesville, Miami Fort, Zimmer, Hanging Rock, Washington, 
      Fayette, Lee and Dicks Creek. The ECP assets include these generating 
      facilities: Milford, Lake Road, Dighton, Masspower, Liberty, Elwood, 
      Richland, Stryker, Kincaid and Brayton Point. Upon closing both 
      transactions, Dynegy will own nearly 26,000 megawatts (MW) of generating 
      capacity nationally and provide retail electricity to residents and 
      businesses in Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
    


      “The two acquisitions announced today are both exceptionally high 
      quality portfolios that have been well managed and run by Duke and ECP 
      employees. The addition of these portfolios transforms Dynegy by adding 
      considerable scale in the PJM and New England markets. The Duke and ECP 
      employees are committed, hard-working men and women and we look forward 
      to engaging their expertise and talent in the combined business. In 
      addition, we intend to honor the terms of the collective bargaining 
      agreements in both generating fleets,” said Dynegy President and Chief 
      Executive Officer Robert C. Flexon. “The addition of these portfolios is 
      forecasted to significantly improve our financial outlook by tripling 
      our 2015 Adjusted EBITDA and being massively accretive to Adjusted 
      EBITDA and Free Cash Flow per share in 2015 and beyond.”
    

Transaction Benefits


      The addition of the ECP assets and the Duke generation portfolio and 
      retail marketing business complements Dynegy’s existing assets and 
      retail business by adding significant scale and fuel diversification in 
      markets the Company currently participates in but otherwise lacks scale. 
      Of the 12,500 MW being acquired, 5,053 MW are modern combined cycle 
      natural gas plants and 3,793 MW are environmentally compliant coal 
      generation plants. Additional benefits from these transactions include:
    


        PJM and ISO-NE capacity payments will represent 25% of the combined 
        company’s gross margin compared to 11% today as a result of 
        quadrupling the size of the PJM fleet and increasing the size of the 
        New England fleet seven-fold.
      

        Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow accretion per share in 2015 of 
        approximately 125% and 220%, respectively.
      

        Dynegy’s $3.2 billion net operating loss position will be available to 
        offset taxable income of the combined company, providing nearly $500 
        million in present value cash tax savings.
      

        In addition to the $40 million in targeted annual cost savings, 
        Dynegy’s existing infrastructure and general and administrative costs 
        will be leveraged across a much larger asset base, reducing the 
        general and administrative cost per MWh from $1.67 to $1.10. As part 
        of the integration, Dynegy will expand its highly successful PRIDE 
        (Producing Results through Innovation by Dynegy Employees) program to 
        both businesses to generate balance sheet and operational efficiencies 
        beyond those identified to date.
      

        Duke Energy Retail will expand Dynegy’s retail business into three new 
        competitive retail markets (Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan). The 
        EquiPower and Duke Ohio generation assets will provide load following 
        generation to support the retail businesses.
      


Transaction Structure


      Dynegy has committed financing in place for both the liquidity 
      facilities and the transaction purchase prices and expects to access the 
      capital markets in advance of closing to raise the permanent financing 
      for the transactions.
    

      Dynegy Inc. intends to issue approximately $5 billion in new unsecured 
      bonds and $1.25 billion in equity and equity-linked securities. Included 
      in the equity figure is $200 million of Dynegy common stock that will be 
      issued to ECP as part of the transaction consideration at closing. To 
      support the collateral and liquidity needs of the combined enterprise, 
      the Company has secured two incremental corporate-level revolving credit 
      facilities totaling $950 million, bringing total revolver capacity at 
      Dynegy Inc. to $1.425 billion. Additionally, approximately $300 million 
      in working capital and cash collateral postings will be transferred to 
      Dynegy with the acquired portfolios at closing.
    

      “The target capital structure of the combined company has been designed 
      to ensure the continued strength and flexibility of our balance sheet 
      and maintain significant secured capacity for both hedging and liquidity 
      requirements going forward. We appreciate the support of the company’s 
      relationship banks which have provided committed financing to ensure 
      both sufficient funds for closing as well as revolver capacity to manage 
      the liquidity requirements of the combined company,” said Dynegy 
      Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Clint Freeland.
    

      The transaction’s financing structure is consistent with the Company’s 
      focus on balance sheet management, value-creating capital allocation, 
      and sufficient liquidity to weather changes in commodity markets. The 
      new assets will be incorporated into Dynegy’s existing first lien 
      structure to support the Company’s hedging and collateral management 
      programs.
    

Combined Portfolio Profile


      To provide investors with a view of the combined company’s earnings 
      power, Dynegy has provided estimated full year 2015 Adjusted EBITDA and 
      Free Cash Flow guidance of $1.2-$1.4 billion and $480 - $680 million, 
      respectively. This assumes that closing of both transactions occurs on 
      December 31, 2014 and that Dynegy owns both portfolios for the full year 
      of 2015.
    

      Dynegy continues to support environmentally compliant coal and gas-fired 
      generation as a responsible way to support America’s future energy 
      needs. Dynegy remains committed to working with local communities, state 
      and federal regulators, and legislators to ensure that affordable, 
      reliable, responsible and environmentally compliant electricity is 
      provided to the communities that the Company serves.
    

      In addition, Dynegy intends to honor the agreement ECP reached to retire 
      the Brayton Point facility on May 31, 2017 and complete the 
      decommissioning following retirement.
    

Approvals and Time to Close


      Both transactions are expected to close by the end of the first quarter 
      2015. The transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, 
      including approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and 
      expiration of Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting periods.
    

Advisors


      Lazard and Credit Suisse acted as financial advisors on both 
      transactions. Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial advisor on the ECP 
      transaction and Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor on the Duke 
      transaction.
    

Investor Conference Call/Webcast


      Dynegy will discuss these acquisitions during an investor conference 
      call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. ET/7:30 a.m. CT. Participants may

      This press release contains statements reflecting assumptions, 
      expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events 
      that are intended as “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of 
      Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E 
      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These 
      forward-looking statements include statements regarding benefits of the 
      proposed transactions, including significant value for Dynegy 
      shareholders, expected capitalization at the closing of the 
      transactions, expected synergies and anticipated future financial 
      operating performance and results, and the ability to close the 
      transactions during the periods indicated above. These statements are 
      based on the current expectations of Dynegy’s management. Discussion of 
      risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from current projections, forecasts, estimates and 
      expectations of Dynegy is contained in Dynegy’s filings with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). 
      Specifically, Dynegy makes reference to, and incorporates herein by 
      reference, the sections entitled “Risk Factors” in its 2013 Form 10-K 
      and second quarter 2014 Form 10-Q. In addition to the risks and 
      uncertainties set forth in Dynegy’s SEC filings, the forward-looking 
      statements described in this press release could be affected by the 
      following, among other things, (i) conditions to the closing of any of 
      the transactions may not be satisfied; (ii) problems may arise in 
      successfully integrating the Duke Energy, EquiPower and Brayton power 
      facilities into Dynegy’s current portfolio, which may result in Dynegy 
      not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected; (iii) Dynegy 
      may be unable to achieve expected synergies or it may take longer than 
      expected to achieve such synergies; (iv) any of the transactions may 
      involve unexpected costs or unexpected liabilities; (v) Dynegy may be 
      unable to obtain regulatory approvals required for any of the 
      transactions or required regulatory approvals may delay any of the 
      transaction or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a 
      material adverse effect on Dynegy or cause Dynegy to abandon any of the 
      transactions; (vi) the business of Dynegy may suffer as a result of 
      uncertainty surrounding the transactions; (vii) the industry may be 
      subject to future regulatory or legislative actions, including 
      environmental, that could adversely affect Dynegy; and (viii) Dynegy may 
      be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive 
      factors. Any or all of Dynegy’s forward-looking statements may turn out 
      to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known 
      or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are 
      beyond Dynegy’s control.

Dynegy delays power plant acquisition to submit additional info to FERC 








01/20/2015

















































Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN) announced that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has requested additional information to process and approve the company’s acquisition of Duke Energy’s (NYSE: DUK) Midwest Generation assets and retail business, and EquiPower Resources and Brayton Point Holdings assets.

The company said it plans to respond within the 30-day period, however, the request is expected to delay the transactions, which were scheduled to close by the end of the first quarter 2015.

Duke Energy announced that Dynegy would buy its non-regulated Midwest Commercial Generation Business for $2.8 billion in cash, on Aug. 22, 2-14. The transaction includes ownership interests in 11 power plants, with a capacity of approximately 6,100-MW, and Duke Energy Retail Sales, the company's competitive retail business in Ohio.

The power plants are:

* Conesville coal-fired station, located in Conesville, Ohio.
* Dicks Creek natural gas facility, located in Middletown, Ohio.
* Fayette natural gas energy facility, located in Masontown, Pennsylvania.[Native Advertisement]
* Hanging Rock natural gas energy facility, located in Ironton, Ohio.
* Killen coal-fired station, located in Wrightsville, Ohio.
* Lee Energy natural gas facility, located in Dixon, Illinois.
* Miami Fort coal-fired station Units 7 & 8, located in North Bend, Ohio.
* Miami Fort oil station, located in North Bend, Ohio.
* Stuart coal-fired station, located in Aberdeen, Ohio.
* Washington natural gas energy facility, located in Beverly, Ohio.
* Zimmer coal-fired generating station, located in Moscow, Ohio.

The power plants are dispatched into the PJM wholesale power market.
