Biography  |




 Interview Date:  10/24/2016 
 Corporate chief executive and investment executive Lloyd G. Trotter was born April 9, 1945, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Lillian Trotter and Reverend Lee Trotter, Sr. He attended high school in Cleveland, graduating in 1963. After high school, Trotter entered an apprenticeship program with Cleveland Twist Drill. He started taking night classes at Cleveland State University while working at Cleveland Twist Drill, graduating in 1972 with his B.A. degree in business administration. 
Trotter was promoted to product design and application engineering at Cleveland Twist Drill before even finishing his degree. He also began working for General Electric (GE) as a field service engineer in 1970, two years before graduating. Trotter stayed at GE for the next thirty-eight years, and was promoted quickly through the ranks. He served as vice president and general manager of the Electrical Distribution and Control division [ED&C] starting in 1990. That same year, he helped found the GE African American Forum, a group for black GE employees to mentor each other. Two years later, he was promoted to president and CEO of ED&C, and then to president and CEO of GE Industrial Systems in 1998. While working in management at GE, he invented the Trotter Matrix, a tool for evaluating standards across various plants. It was quickly adopted throughout the company. In 2003, Trotter became senior vice president of GE, and in 2005, he was named executive vice president of operations at GE. He held this position until 2006, when he was promoted to vice chairman of GE. In 2008, after almost forty years, Trotter left GE to help found the private equity firm GenNx360 Capital Partners, with Ronald Baylock and Arthur Harper.
Trotter has served on the Board of Directors of PepsiCo since 2008. He received the 2001 Lifetime Achievement Award from GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt and the GE Chairman’s Awards three consecutive years from 2003-2005. He received an honorary doctorate degree from his alma mater, Cleveland State University, and an honorary doctorate degree from North Carolina A&T School of Business. Trotter has served on the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, and National Electrical Manufacturers Association boards. The National Society of Black Engineers [NSBE] established a scholarship in his name, and the Harlem YMCA presented him the Black Achievers in Industry Award. 
Trotter and his wife, Teri, live in Connecticut. They have three children. 
Lloyd G. Trotter was interviewed by The HistoryMakers on October 25, 2016.
