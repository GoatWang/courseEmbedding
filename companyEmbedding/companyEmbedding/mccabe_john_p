Recent Case Results



Estate of Amy Dickerson v. Lindley Habilitation
                 Recovery: $2,045,000.00
                
 Wrongful death claim arising out of a head-on motor vehicle collision near Winston-Salem. The collision occurred when a Lindley Habilitation van crossed the center line, struck Amy Dickerson's car, and pinned it against a concrete bridge barrier. The impact caused Amy Dickerson's car to catch on fire, and Amy died for her injuries. At the time of her death, Amy was a 36-year-old married mother of two. The defendants denied liability for the collision, contending that they should not be held responsible because their employee had a sudden medical emergency just before the wreck. After being hired, The Law Offices of John M. McCabe immediately retained experts in accident reconstruction, who retrieved and downloaded the information from the van's "black box." The black box information showed that the driver most likely did not have a sudden medical event before the wreck. After obtaining this information, a lawsuit was initiated and discovery was pursued aggressively. The case settled at mediation shortly after The Law Offices of John M. McCabe deposed the at-fault driver. The settlement included a complete exhaustion of all available insurance proceeds, plus an additional out-of-pocket payment directly from the defendants.

Estate of Amy Dickerson v. Lindley Habilitation
                 Recovery: $2,045,000.00
                
 Wrongful death claim arising out of a head-on motor vehicle collision near Winston-Salem. The collision occurred when a Lindley Habilitation van crossed the center line, struck Amy Dickerson's car, and pinned it against a concrete bridge barrier. The impact caused Amy Dickerson's car to catch on fire, and Amy died for her injuries. At the time of her death, Amy was a 36-year-old married mother of two. The defendants denied liability for the collision, contending that they should not be held responsible because their employee had a sudden medical emergency just before the wreck. After being hired, The Law Offices of John M. McCabe immediately retained experts in accident reconstruction, who retrieved and downloaded the information from the van's "black box." The black box information showed that the driver most likely did not have a sudden medical event before the wreck. After obtaining this information, a lawsuit was initiated and discovery was pursued aggressively. The case settled at mediation shortly after The Law Offices of John M. McCabe deposed the at-fault driver. The settlement included a complete exhaustion of all available insurance proceeds, plus an additional out-of-pocket payment directly from the defendants.
