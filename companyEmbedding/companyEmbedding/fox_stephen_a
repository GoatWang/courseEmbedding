With clothes for men and women in standard and extended sizes, plus a full collection of clothes for babies and children of all ages, we've got all your clothing bases covered at Every Day Low Prices. You can meet all of your wardrobe needs in this section of our site; swimwear, cold weather gear, sleepwear, gym clothes, work outfits, tees and tank tops, jeans, suits, dresses, underwear, socks and more are all included in this department. Take in the full range of our clothing options by choosing "Shop All Clothing," or narrow down your options by choosing one of our specialized Clothing department sections or shops.Women's Clothing SectionsThe Women's Clothing department has several sections and shops to choose from. You can pick out your size range or the type of clothing you need to buy in order to focus in on the clothes you need. Special subcategories in the Women's Clothing department make it easier for women with particular clothing needs to find what they want. The Maternity section has specially designed and sized bottoms, tops, dresses, nursing clothes, activewear and leggings made especially for expectant mothers. Click into this section if you're expecting a little bundle of joy and need to update your wardrobe accordingly. Our Women's Plus section is suitable for women who prefer their clothes with a curvier cut in larger sizes, while the Women's Petite section is suitable for those ladies who find standard sizes too roomy or too long in the sleeve and leg.Men's Clothing SectionsMen have a few options to narrow down their clothing choices. The Men's Clothing department includes a full range of clothes for any occasion, time of day or season, and those men who find standard clothing sizes comfortable can find what they need in the main department sections. Men who are larger or taller than average can focus on the Men's Big & Tall section to find extended sizes in all of the same wardrobe essentials and extra elements found in the main Men's Clothing department.Clothes for KidsIt's easiest to shop for kids' clothes by focusing on the specific section that caters to their age or size range. The Baby & Toddler, Boys and Girls sections are further subdivided into categories for infants, toddlers, little boys and girls. The main children's clothing sections cater to boys and girls who are usually in elementary and middle school, though each kid may size out of these ranges at different points in their lives. We also have a Junior's section for girls who have outgrown the clothes in the girls' section but aren't yet ready for grown-up women's fashions. Young men in the same situation can find smaller sizes in the Men's Clothing department.Specialty Clothing ShopsYou can also shop based on occasion or activity if you have specific clothing needs and want to filter out all the items that aren't relevant. We have a Swim Shop with swimwear for every family member, age group and style need, and we also offer a separate Activewear section with athletic clothes for physical activity on dry land. You can find appropriate outdoor and safety clothes for women, men, girls and boys in the Hunting Shop, which has a variety of camo options and layering pieces to outfit everyone for family hunting activities. Adults and kids alike can show their enthusiasm for a sports team or pop culture franchise in our Sports Fan and Character shops, which offer tees, pajamas, hoodies, hats, jackets and other wardrobe pieces featuring the colors, logos and character designs you love.Other Wardrobe Items in the Clothing DepartmentYou can shop for much more than just clothing in this department; we also offer shoes, jewelry and other accessories. Like the other categories in Clothing, our shoes, jewelry, bags and other accessories are available in a range of styles and sizes for the whole family. You can stock up on dress shoes, school or work shoes, slippers and cold-weather boots by clicking into the appropriate shoe section for the person you're shopping for. Our Jewelry department, which you can access through the main Clothing department page, includes several different categories such as fashion jewelry, engagement and wedding rings, fine jewelry, watches and jewelry storage options. If you're looking for bags and other wearable accessories like belts and hats, you can take a look at the categories in our Bags & Accessories department, which is also accessible through the main Clothing department page. Find casual, everyday or athletic bags for kids and adults in the Backpacks section, or look for suitcases, handbags and briefcases in the Bags & Luggage section. You'll find all the additional accessories you need to finalize a formal or casual outfit in our Hats & Accessories section. From bowties and cummerbunds to baseball caps and casual scarves, you can find exactly what you need to complete your outfit in this product category.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863236, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
* Denotes a required field. All required fields must be filled out for us to be able to process your form.



From our Membership Agreement
"Lulu is a place where people of all ages, backgrounds, experience, and professions can publish, sell, or buy creative content such as novels, memoirs, poetry, cookbooks, technical manuals, articles, photography books, children's books, calendars, and a host of other content that defies easy categorization. We help people distribute information and art spanning a wide range of subject matter while providing a safe, friendly, respectful, and serious site for all content creators. Since our community serves a broad range of ages, we do not encourage content that could make a majority of our users uncomfortable."
If you are sure that this product is in violation of acceptable content as defined in the agreement or that it does not meet our guidelines for General Access, please fill out the form below. It will then be reviewed by Lulu Staff to determine the next course of action.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STORETransatlantic: Samuel Cunard, Isambard Brunel, And The Great Atlantic Steamshipsby Fox, Stephen R.During the nineteenth century, the roughest but most important ocean passage in the world lay between Britain and the United States. Bridging the Atlantic Ocean by steamship was a defining, remarkable feat of the era. Over time, Atlantic steamships became the largest, most complex machines yet devised. They created a new transatlantic world of commerce and travel, reconciling former Anglo-American enemies and bringing millions of emigrants who transformed the United States.In Transatlantic, the experience of crossing the Atlantic is re-created in stunning detail from the varied perspectives of first class, steerage, officers, and crew. The dynamic evolution of the Atlantic steamer is traced from Brunel'sGreat Western of 1838 to Cunard's Mauretania of 1907, the greatest steamship ever built.General, History, NavigationCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Stephen Colbert Has Some New Slogans for Fox News (Video)



Cable network dropped “Fair and Balanced” — probably “because they finally watched themselves,” CBS host quips

Tony Maglio | June 16, 2017 @ 7:29 AM




 Stephen Colbert on 'The Late Show' 


Some say Fox News Channel was never actually “Fair and Balanced.” Well now, they’re officially distancing themselves from that slogan — and Stephen Colbert thinks that’s hysterical.
“Fox News is dropping its ‘Fair and Balanced’ slogan,” he said during Thursday’s “Late Show” monologue, “I assume because they finally watched themselves.”
For now, the No. 1 cable news network will go with “Most Watched. Most Trusted.” Colbert’s got a few other replacements in mind — read the suggestions below, and watch the video above.

13 Most-Watched Fox News Shows Since Tucker Carlson Replaced Bill O'Reilly (Photos)






Bill O’Reilly dominated the cable news industry for nearly two decades, finishing No. 1 in all of cable news for 16 straight years. But his sudden exit resulted in a programming shakeup at Fox News Channel.
TheWrap





Fox News fired O’Reilly back in April amid sexual harassment allegations and “Tucker Carlson Tonight” was shifted from 9 p.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET to replace “The O’Reilly Factor,” while other shows were also moved as a result. Check out the 13 most-watched programs (in reverse order) on Fox News among total viewers since the new lineup debuted on April 24.
