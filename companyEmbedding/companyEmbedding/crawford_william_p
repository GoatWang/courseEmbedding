 From the author of many nautical texts comes The Lake, a contemplative brouhaha that is part science fiction, part environmental commentary, and packed with the not-so subtle ironies of life. While many seafarers know Captain William P. Crawford from his previous works of nonfiction, his timely foray into creative writing is nothing short of brilliant. His pitch-perfect prose is complemented by the witty banter of his intriguing archetypal characters and as he illustrates a likeable group of people threatened by a truly curious natural disaster he conveys the vulnerability of the American Dream. After Southern California’s Lake Crowley is split at its foundation by an earthquake, the water becomes an elixir—and a truth serum. As desperate people migrate to its shores to drink from its waters, pandemonium besets Los Angeles and a group of public servants, including the California governor and American president, will be forced to intercede between human nature and Mother Nature.

About the Author


Captain William P. Crawford, an author famed among mariners throughout the world, was born to an Irish seafaring family in San Francisco in 1922. His college career was interrupted by World War II service in the Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean-Middle East war zones and he was an unlimited shipmaster by the time he was twenty-two years old. After the war he practiced admiralty law until joining in the operation of the family training school for shipmasters and officers. He is the author of a number of highly acclaimed books, which were the monthly selections of nautical book clubs. He is now retired and lives in Portland, Oregon. The Lake is his first novel.

The Fountain of Youth premise was thoughtfully written and well-executed.  I can tell that Crawford spent a lot of time researching to write this book.  I love to read a book where it's obvious that the author has a good grip on what he's writing about.The love stories fell a little short for my personal taste; I guess I am a "love junkie" who needs a consuming love story in every book.  This book wasn't one of my favorites; however, I think that there were tons of people who would disagree with me.  The Lake was well done and I would recommend it to anyone interested in science, politics, or the environment.Just One Gripe:There were parts that felt slow to me.  The pacing was more of a non-fiction pace at times.The Best Thing About This Book:The premise is unique.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA Seasoned Nonfiction Author Tries his Hand at Fiction, and SucceedsByJohn M. Alleman, BookPleasures Revieweron October 15, 2010Format: PaperbackThe Lake, described as science fiction meets environmental commentary, debut novel written by William P. Crawford--a respected author of nautical nonfiction--will soothe you with a vision of Jeff's predicament of joining an old college buddy's company as a PR rep after suffering a scandal that nearly ended his career. Then suddenly the narrative snatches you unawares and refuses to release until you've absorbed its final chapter.All's well in the neighborhood as Jeff, a widow with twin boys who stay at his in-laws, settles in at his new job and becomes friendly with the Irish beauty next door. But alas, the easy living in California for which Jeff was hoping comes to a raging standstill as one of the lakes--Lake Crowley--his friend Chet's company overseas begins behaving in the oddest way. An earthquake opens a crevice at the bottom of the lake, causing unknown elements to seep into the water and give it medicinal properties. The news of this discovery causes a worldwide upheaval and Jeff, Chet, along with Governor Lindero and President Weston must act quickly so the whole world doesn't trample California with hopes of drinking from the fountain of youth.The stakes get higher when everyone realizes that the water also acts as a truth serum. Being compelled to tell the truth could prove rather inconvenient to a lot of people. Is losing one's discretion worth a lifetime of health?What's more is chemists stumble upon the bad news that the water's magical attributes have a four-month shelf life. If another earthquake forces the fissure under Lake Crowley closed, all the water of the lake will have lost its unique properties in a mere sixteen weeks. Now the scientists must race against time to formulate a synthetic in case such an occurrence does happen.The Lake sprints from start to finish so quickly the reader may forget to breath. The novel's short chapters and unencumbered prose urge the reader to progress at a pace that could dizzy a Formula One driver.But The Lake's intense plot and whiplash pacing aren't what make it rise above mediocrity. This phenomenon has Crawford's plush dialogue and engaging Irish legend-telling to thank. The characters are archetypal, their dialogue is always thoughtful, even in the midst of banter, and I couldn't have expected a better telling of Irish history from poets and bards.With The Lake, Crawford showed his prestige with the pen and never ceased to pull out all the stops. I look forward to what the future holds for Mr. Crawford's fiction writing career.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsNautical writerByAmi Blackwelderon June 23, 2010Format: PaperbackNautical writer William P Crawford takes the reader on a journey with such detail, genuine prose, and control over the English language, that the reader will feel the cold, and taste the sweat....Zigzagging across the great Plains to Boise and then to Spokane, Then smearing the tops of White Mountains bordering the western edge of Nevada....a volcano exploding is the first event to startled the main character and draw the read into a story he/she will never forget.Interesting characters and a twisting plot that will keep the reader at the seat of his/her seat...turning pages through the night until the end is reached.I recommend this story to anyone who enjoys suspense, action-thrilelrs, and nautical information.Ami Blackwelder[...]Read more0Comment|

William Crawford Sr. to Retire as President and CEO of Steelcase Design Partnership and Attwood
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 13, 2000--James P. Hackett, president and CEO of Steelcase Inc. (NYSE:SCS), today announced that William Crawford Sr., a 34-year Steelcase employee and member of the Board of Directors, plans to retire as president and CEO of the Steelcase Design Partnership (SDP) and Attwood on May 1, 2000. Crawford will remain a member of the Steelcase Board of Directors, a position to which he was elected in 1979. 


     "Bill has had a rich and varied career at Steelcase, and he's always performed in an outstanding fashion," said Hackett. "We'll miss his many day-to-day contributions, but look forward to his continuing involvement on our Board of Directors. 


     "The grandson of Walter Idema, one of the three founders of Steelcase, Bill has always had a strong personal commitment to the success of the company," Hackett continued. "This is most evident in his mentoring of people, and it's obvious that our employees have appreciated Bill's leadership over the years. He has made it a priority to guide others to realize their potential. That speaks volumes about his character." 


     Crawford has led the Steelcase Design Partnership since 1991. The SDP now includes Brayton International, DesignTex, Details, JM Lynne, Metro, Vecta and Wigand. He was given responsibility for Attwood, a manufacturer of marine products and plastic parts, in 1994. In his nine-year tenure, the SDP has increased in sales and profitability by 300 percent, has introduced 200 new products and become an important component of the growth strategy of Steelcase Inc. 


     In 1965, Crawford began his career with Steelcase as a time-study engineer. He held positions in industrial engineering and plant management before being promoted to vice president of operations at Stow Davis in 1985, shortly after the company was acquired by Steelcase. From 1986 to 1991, he was president of Stow Davis. 


     A process for naming Crawford's replacement is under way and his successor will be announced in the near future.

This book about the weather, written by a master mariner, sets out to fill the gap between instant knowledge books which prvide a veneer of jargon, and heavy texts requiring prior knowledge of meteorology. This book presents instead a seamanlike survey of the basics of weather, offering a foundation for practical observation and interpretation as well as a ground-work for advanced study.

Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicinePerforming ArtsScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

Overview



From the author of many nautical texts comes The Lake, a contemplative brouhaha that is part science fiction, part environmental commentary, and packed with the not-so subtle ironies of life. While many seafarers know Captain William P. Crawford from his previous works of nonfiction, his timely foray into creative writing is nothing short of brilliant. His pitch-perfect prose is complemented by the witty banter of his intriguing archetypal characters and as he illustrates a likeable group of people threatened by a truly curious natural disaster he conveys the vulnerability of the American Dream. After Southern California's Lake Crowley is split at its foundation by an earthquake, the water becomes an elixir-and a truth serum. As desperate people migrate to its shores to drink from its waters, pandemonium besets Los Angeles and a group of public servants, including the California governor and American president, will be forced to intercede between human nature and Mother Nature.

Meet the Author



Captain William P. Crawford, an author famed among mariners throughout the world, was born to an Irish seafaring family in San Francisco in 1922. His college career was interrupted by World War II service in the Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean-Middle East war zones and he was an unlimited shipmaster by the time he was twenty-two years old. After the war he practiced admiralty law until joining in the operation of the family training school for shipmasters and officers. He is the author of a number of highly acclaimed books, which were the monthly selections of nautical book clubs. He is now retired and lives in Portland, Oregon. The Lake is his first novel.
