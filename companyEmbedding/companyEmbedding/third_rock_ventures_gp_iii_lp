Our Investment Strategy Third Rock Ventures






















Philosophy
We build great companies in order to make a dramatic difference for patients








Our Investment Strategy
Discover. Launch. Build.
Our Mission & Core Values



Our Investment Strategy
We discover, launch and build great companies based on bold ideas that meet at the intersection of science, strategy, business and medicine - where transformational science meets operational reality - providing the best opportunity to make a dramatic difference in patients' lives. 







The Third Rock Team
   Our team has a proven record of translating disruptive technologies into valuable business enterprises. We adhere to a “Third Rock Forever” philosophy, realizing that we have been phenomenally successful because of the contributions of the whole Third Rock team. People are our greatest asset, and we invest significant effort and resources to ensure we hire the best people at Third Rock and across the portfolio. Working closely with leading scientific and business visionaries, as well as industry partners, our team is focused on identifying opportunities to change the future of medicine and rigorously vets those ideas through our discovery process to develop the vision, strategy and plan needed to succeed. Learn About Our People | Download Third Rock Team Fact Sheet











A Formula for Innovation
We only invest in the best of those ideas. We are actively involved in the early stages of our companies' development, typically serving as members of the founding management teams, to build a strong foundation, put in place the right people and culture, and set the companies on a path to scientific and operational excellence. View Our Portfolio | Download Third Rock Company Fact Sheet
Then, we build on that foundation, transitioning out of our interim leadership roles as we put in place rock star management teams. We bring to bear the vast experience, expertise and network of our team and across our portfolio to help our companies succeed. Management teams can tap into our network of experts across disciplines, including science, medicine, business, healthcare economics and regulatory strategy. Our partner development team leverages our relationships with decision-makers in pharma to support business development efforts across our portfolio. Our strategy team serves as an advisory resource around critical business development, financial and operational decisions. Our Beyond Great leadership program provides our portfolio leaders with a peer-to-peer network, as well as tools and resources focused on shared elements of building transformational companies. We build great companies together, with our portfolio leaders, scientific founders, advisors and industry partners.









"We try never to forget that medicine is for the people. It is not for the profits. The profits follow, and if we have remembered that, they have never failed to appear. The better we have remembered it, the larger they have been."
