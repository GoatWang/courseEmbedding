Q&A:	WILLIAM B. SHIEBLER -- "ONE-YEAR PERFORMANCE IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO PLAY WITH"





Mar 16, 1998 @ 12:01 am
By 
	Frederick P. Gabriel


















Putnam Investments attributes much of its success to teamwork, often assigning four or five managers to a single mutual fund. That way, its fortunes do not ride on any one manager. But the strategic direction of the company has rested firmly in the hands of one man:	William N. Shiebler, president of Putnam's retail mutual fund business for the past eight years. And his shoes are not going to be easy to fill when he retires in about two years. Mr. Shiebler's successor will manage a business that accounts for about $190 billion of the No. 5 fund company's $248 billion in assets.Known in the mutual fund industry as a visionary, Mr. Shiebler was one of the first to view banks as a distribution channel. Today Putnam says 95% of the banks that market mutual funds offer its wares. More recently, he's won kudos for insisting that fund managers maintain style consistency -- way before the issue moved to center stage.While the company searches for a successor, Mr. Shiebler, who spent 12 years with Dean Witter Reynolds, is doing what he does best:	selling mutual funds. Putnam will debut several new ones, including a fund slated for June to be managed by 30 research analysts.
				



QWhere do you see the greatest opportunities to expand your product line?A It's still in domestic equities. I mean, you don't leave the party until it's over and certainly the market has been so strong that domestic equity is the primary part of our product line. But we see great opportunity in international funds. We doubled our market share last year. We think there's opportunity in the high-yield sector. And we think investors are going to increasingly use tax-deferred annuities because of the attractive features and benefits they have.Q In 1997, the average return on Putnam's U.S. stock funds trailed many of the 10 largest fund families. Are you doing anything to turn that around this year?A It would be much nicer to be No. 1 on the one-year list, but to tell you the truth it's the three-, five- and 10-year numbers we focus on. One-year performance is a very dangerous thing to play with in the mutual fund business.Q Are you worried about more banks introducing their own funds?AWe are a major player in bank distribution and we will continue to be, mainly because we took it more seriously than some of our competitors did. Look, our biggest distributors in the broker-dealer business -- Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney, Prudential, Dean Witter, and PaineWebber -- all have their own proprietary mutual fund businesses that they started in the early 1980s. And that has not stopped us from being very successful.Q What, if anything, are you doing to help brokers and planners distribute your funds?A We're the biggest seller of funds through advisers. They are the backbone of our business. First and foremost, we are an investment management company, not a marketing company. We plan to introduce more tools for advisers, especially in the way of electronic distribution. We plan to do more in the way of having a direct link with advisers on the Internet.Q When is it OK for a manager to drift from a consistent style?AWe don't think it's OK at all, unless it's announced to investors. We think if you buy a can of soup and it says tomato soup, you don't want to open it up and find out it's pork and beans.Q With the Dow over 8,000, what are you doing to prep for a correction?A Even with the market at these new highs, there are a lot of values out there. The market is different than it was last spring:	Interest rates are lower, corporate earnings are still continuing to work rather well and the inflation news is still very positive. We're not bearish on the markets.Q Are you uneasy about the amount of money pouring into mutual funds?A Money has been pouring into mutual funds for a long time and I think it's going to continue to pour in for a long time. The boomers have suddenly realized that the retirement bell is going to ring sometime in the next 15 years or more. In the U.S. right now, the most attractive savings vehicle is still the mutual fund. You don't have high yields coming from bank deposits.Q Let's talk about your own retirement. Have you found a successor?A We're in the process of recruiting one right now. I'm going to work with that person for a while. At some point in time, I'll assume a lower profile within Putnam mutual funds.Q Will that person come from within the company?A We've got a lot of strong talent within the company. But Putnam has a history of being able to recruit outstanding people from outside the company and even outside the industry. We're going to continue to do that kind of thing.VitaeWilliam N. Shiebler, 55, senior managing director, president, Putnam Mutual Funds, Boston.Putnam Fund for Growth and Income (assets:	$33.3 billion):	1-year return, 23.26%;3-year, 27.09%; 5-year, 19.41%Voyager Fund (assets:	$19.5 billion):	1-year return, 34.86%; 3-year, 27.23%; 5-year, 21.52%New Opportunities Fund (assets:	$15.9billion):	1-year return, 32.79%; 3-year, 27.55%;5-year, 25.87%Standard & Poor's 500-stock index:	1-year, 35.01%; 3-year, 31.88%; 5-year, 21.69%source:	Putnam Investments, Lipper Analytical Services Inc.Returns through Feb. 28; annualized for periods over one year.
