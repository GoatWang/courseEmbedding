About Us

    Venado’s founding partners were formerly senior management at Pioneer Natural Resources and San Isidro Development.     In December 2010, San Isidro Development successfully completed a divestiture of its Eagle Ford Shale assets to Chesapeake for $200 million. Following this transaction, Venado Oil & Gas, LLC was established on January 1, 2011 and located its headquarters west of Austin, Texas near Lake Travis. 

    The Venado management team’s core strengths include significant relationships, transaction experience, regional expertise and operating capabilities in South Texas based on a combined 100+ years of experience with companies such as Pioneer Natural Resources, San Isidro Development, Dan A. Hughes Company, Raymond James and Woodside. With the team’s operational track record and abilities, Venado is well positioned to execute the drilling, completion and production of extended reach horizontal wells through multi-stage fracture stimulation followed by timely hookup of oil and natural gas production to sales.
Mission Statement

    At Venado Oil & Gas we use a subsurface driven approach to understand and develop oil and natural gas properties that fit within an economic framework. As a multi-disciplined team specializing in geology, engineering, land and finance, we utilize the latest technology and innovation to maximize the recovery of hydrocarbons.
