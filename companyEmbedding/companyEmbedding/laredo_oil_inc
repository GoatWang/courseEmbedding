CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT
Laredo Oil, Inc. (“the Corporation”)
The Board maintains policies and procedures (which we refer to as our Code) that represent both the code of ethics for the principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer under SEC rules and the code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees. The Code applies to all directors, officers and employees.
The Code is posted on the official Laredo Oil, Inc. website and is available free of charge by download in PDF format. If you have questions or comments, or would like to request a hardcopy, please feel free to write or call at:

The Board Affairs Committee will review any issues with the Code involving an executive officer or director and will report its findings to the Board. The Board does not envision that any waivers of the
Code will be granted, but should a waiver occur for an executive officer or director, it will also be promptly disclosed on the website.
The Code consists of the Ethics Policy, the Conflicts of Interest Policy, the Corporate Assets Policy, the
Directorships Policy and the section below called the, “Procedures and Open Door Communications.”
The Code follows:
Ethics Policy
The policy of Laredo Oil, Inc. is to comply with all governmental laws, rules and regulations applicable to its business.
Additionally, the Corporation expects compliance with its standard of integrity throughout the organization and will not tolerate employees who achieve results at the cost of violation of law or who deal unscrupulously. The Corporation’s directors and officers support, and expect the Corporation’s employees to support, any employee who passes up an opportunity or advantage that would sacrifice ethical standards.
It is the Corporation’s policy that all transactions will be accurately reflected in its books and records. Employees are expected to record all transactions accurately in the Corporation’s books and records, and to be honest and forthcoming with the Corporation’s internal and independent auditors.
The Corporation expects candor from employees at all levels and adherence to its policies and internal controls.
It is the Corporation’s policy to make full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Corporation files with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications. All employees are responsible for reporting material information known to them to higher management so that the information will be available to senior executives responsible for making disclosure decisions.
Corporate Values
Laredo Oil, Inc. subscribes to the following values:
Integrity – the Corporation is honest, fair, impartial, equitable, honorable, and trustworthy in all transactions, dealings, and relationships; adhering to moral and ethical principles.
Responsibility – the Corporation is consistent, reliable, timely, compliant with all laws, rules and regulations, and accountable to governing authority.

Conflict of Interest Policy
It is the policy of Laredo Oil, Inc. that directors, officers and employees are expected to avoid any actual or apparent conflict between their own personal interests and the interests of the Corporation. Directors, officers and employees are expected to refrain from taking for themselves opportunities discovered through their use of corporate assets or through their positions with the Corporation. Directors, officers and employees are expected to avoid securities transactions based on material, nonpublic information learned through their positions with the Corporation. Directors, officers and employees are expected to refrain from competing with the Corporation.
Corporate Assets Policy
It is the policy of Laredo Oil, Inc. that directors, officers and employees are expected to protect the assets of the Corporation and use them efficiently to advance the interests of the Corporation. Those assets include tangible assets and intangible assets, such as confidential information of the Corporation. No director, officer or employee should use or disclose at any time during or subsequent to employment or other service to the Corporation, without proper authority or mandate, confidential information obtained from any source in the Corporation’s business.
Directorships Policy
It is the policy of Laredo Oil, Inc. to restrict the holdings by officers and employees of directorships in nonaffiliated, for-profit organizations and to prohibit the acceptance by any officer or employee of such directorship that would involve a conflict of interest with, or interfere with, the discharge of the officer’s or employee’s duties to the Corporation. Any officer or employee may hold directorships in nonaffiliated, nonprofit organizations, unless such directorships would involve a conflict of interest with, or interfere with, the discharge of the officer’s or employee’s duties to the Corporation, or obligate the Corporation to provide support to the nonaffiliated, nonprofit organizations. Officers and employees may serve as directors of affiliated companies and such service may be part of their normal work assignments.
All directorships in public companies held by directors of the Corporation are subject to review and approval by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. In all other cases, directorships in nonaffiliated, for- profit organizations are subject to review and approval by the management of the Corporation, as directed by the Chairman.
Procedures and Open Door Communication
Laredo Oil, Inc. encourages employees to ask questions, voice concerns and make appropriate suggestions regarding the business practices of the Corporation. Employees are expected to report promptly to management suspected violations of law, the Corporation’s policies and the Corporation’s internal controls, so that management can take appropriate corrective action. The Corporation promptly investigates reports of suspected violations of law, policies, and internal control procedures.
Management is ultimately responsible for the investigation of and appropriate response to reports of suspected violations of law, policies and internal control procedures. Internal Audit has primary responsibility for investigating violations of the Corporation’s internal controls, with the assistance from others, depending on the subject matter of the inquiry. The persons who investigate suspected violations are expected to exercise independent and objective judgment.
Failure to behave honestly and failure to comply with law, the Corporation’s policies, and the
Corporation’s internal controls may result in disciplinary action, up to and including separation.
No one in the Corporation has the authority to make exceptions or grant waivers to the Corporation’s foundation policies. It is recognized that there will be questions about the application of the policies to specific activities and situations. In cases of doubt, directors, officers and employees are expected to seek clarification and guidance. In those instances where the Corporation, after review, approves an activity or situation, the Corporation is not granting an exception or waiver but is determining that there is no policy violation. If the Corporation determines that there is or would be a policy violation, appropriate action is taken.

Current operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 167 million barrels of oil equivalent (1.02×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 38% was oil and 62% was natural gas. All of these reserves were in the Permian Basin. The company controlled 127,847 net acres in the Permian Basin, where it had 1,088 net producing wells. The company had average daily production in 2016 of 49 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (300,000 GJ).[2]
The company drills almost all of its wells using what it calls the "earth model", which it claims increases efficiency.[3]
History[edit]
The company was founded in October 2006 by Randy Foutch, the current chairman and chief executive officer.[2]
In July 2011, the company acquired Broad Oak Energy in a $1 billion transaction, which expanded its presence in the Permian Basin.[4] Broad Oak was founded in May 2006 by David B. Braddock and Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX with funding of a $150MM equity commitment which was subsequently increased to $200MM.[5][6] Broad Oak Energy is credited with the discovery of the play by its drilling of the first Wolfcamp Shale well, the Sugg A159 AH well, in July 2009.[5][6]
On December 20, 2011, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.[2]
In May 2013, Laredo sold its assets in the Anadarko Basin in western Oklahoma and Texas to affiliates of EnerVest Ltd for $438 million to raise capital for its drilling activities in the Permian Basin.[7]
As of September 2013, Laredo had drilled over 75 horizontal wells targeting four horizons: the Upper Wolfcamp, the Middle Wolfcamp, the Lower Wolfcamp, and the Cline Shale.[8]

As of December 31, 2016, the company had 167 million barrels of oil equivalent (1.02×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 38% was oil and 62% was natural gas. All of these reserves were in the Permian Basin. The company controlled 127,847 net acres in the Permian Basin, where it had 1,088 net producing wells. The company had average daily production in 2016 of 49 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (300,000 GJ).[2]
The company drills almost all of its wells using what it calls the "earth model", which it claims increases efficiency.[3]
History[edit]
The company was founded in October 2006 by Randy Foutch, the current chairman and chief executive officer.[2]
In July 2011, the company acquired Broad Oak Energy in a $1 billion transaction, which expanded its presence in the Permian Basin.[4] Broad Oak was founded in May 2006 by David B. Braddock and Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX with funding of a $150MM equity commitment which was subsequently increased to $200MM.[5][6] Broad Oak Energy is credited with the discovery of the play by its drilling of the first Wolfcamp Shale well, the Sugg A159 AH well, in July 2009.[5][6]
On December 20, 2011, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.[2]
In May 2013, Laredo sold its assets in the Anadarko Basin in western Oklahoma and Texas to affiliates of EnerVest Ltd for $438 million to raise capital for its drilling activities in the Permian Basin.[7]
As of September 2013, Laredo had drilled over 75 horizontal wells targeting four horizons: the Upper Wolfcamp, the Middle Wolfcamp, the Lower Wolfcamp, and the Cline Shale.[8]

IN SUCH CASES, GETHIRED’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. (b)Limitation of Damages. IN

GETHIRED WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.
(e)Limitations by Applicable Law.
        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AND JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.
16.Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.
(a)Dispute Resolution.
        In the interest of resolving disputes between you and GetHired in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and GetHired agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with the Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. You understand and agree that, by entering into the Terms, you and GetHired are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
(b)Exceptions.
Notwithstanding subsection (a), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
(c)Arbitrator.
Any arbitration between you and GetHired will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by the Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting GetHired.
(d)Notice; Process.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail                (“Notice”).
GetHired’s address for Notice is:
                GetHired, Inc., 
                540 University Ave, Suite #50, Palo Alto, CA 94301.

The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or GetHired may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or GetHired shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, GetHired shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and (ii) the greatest amount offered by GetHired in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award.
(e)Fees.
In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with the Terms, GetHired will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $5,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, provided that if the claim is for $5,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse GetHired for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
(f)No Class Actions. 
                        YOU AND GETHIRED AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and GetHired agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not therwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
(g)Modifications.
In the event that GetHired makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the GetHired’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to GetHired’s address for Notice, in which case your account with GetHired shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.
(h)Enforceability.
If only Subsection        No Class Actions.        YOU AND GETHIRED AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.         Further, unless both you and GetHired agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If any of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the “Miscellaneous” Section, below, shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Terms.
17.Miscellaneous.
(a)Governing Law and Jurisdiction.
        The Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Terms or Service will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for Santa Clara County, California, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. Notwithstanding this, either party shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce that party’s intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction where the other party resides or has its principal place of business.
(b)Improperly Filed Claims.
All claims you bring against GetHired must be resolved in accordance with this Agreement. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Agreement shall be considered improperly filed. Should either party file a claim contrary to this Agreement, the other party may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to one thousand U.S. Dollars ($1,000.00 USD), provided that such party seeking such fees has notified the other in writing of the improperly filed claim, and the other has failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
(c)Claims.
        YOU AND GETHIRED AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
(d)Notice.
        GetHired may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email or by postings on the Service. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after email is sent, unless GetHired is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by you through the Service. In such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing. Notice posted on the Service is deemed given 30 days following the initial posting.
(e)Waiver.
        The failure of GetHired to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by GetHired.
(f)Severability.
        If any provision of the Terms or any Guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from the Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.        
(g)Assignment.
               The Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by GetHired without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of the Terms shall be void.
(h)Headings.
        The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of the Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.
(i)Entire Agreement.
       The Terms, including without limitation the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and GetHired relating to the subject matter herein and may not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to the Terms or Privacy Policy made by GetHired as set forth in Section 3 above.
(j)Disclosures.
        The Service is hosted in the United States, and the services provided hereunder are offered by Get Hired, Inc.:        540 University Ave. Suite 50 Palo
Alto CA 94301.

Our relationship with the CDW team is integral to our operations. They understand our IT infrastructure and our challenges, whether it’s integrating with emerging technologies, capitalizing on data analytics, building a business case for technology investment or reducing our licensing costs — which they helped us lower by 55%.




				
				Mario Martinez, Network Engineering Manager, Linn Energy

			









I must say that CDW has always provided competitive pricing and excellent customer service that just cannot be found anywhere else.

 IT Solutions Tailored to Your Needs
Energy providers face unique challenges. Our experts can help you tackle them.
 






























You Need Security
Energy companies are a prime target for security breaches and face myriad serious threats, from individual hackers to foreign governments. The consequences of a security incident can be disastrous for both you and your customers. We can help protect your organization using industrial IT security.
First, we can help you assess your current cyberassets and vulnerabilities. Then we can work together to design an industrial cybersecurity strategy. We’ll help you draft a plan for what to do before, during and after a cyberattack, and then we’ll work with you to implement and deploy it.

You Need Support for a Mobile Workforce
When it comes to mobile, one device doesn’t fit all. Mobile workers in the energy industry can be traveling professionals who need to access business data on the road or field employees whose work is as diverse as drilling on a rig or delivering heating oil to customers. Consumer-grade equipment just won’t cut it — and neither will a consumer-grade mobile strategy.
Rugged devices need a ruggedized network. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks help you connect scattered sites and hardened equipment so you can remotely monitor and control operations. The benefits of a ruggedized approach are numerous, from greater automation to reduced environmental impact, not to mention improved collaboration between devices, people and systems.


Learn how to harness ruggedized networking and IoT to maximize business performance. Get the article.





































You Need High-Performance Computing and Analytics
As companies come under increasing pressure to make their operations as cost-efficient as possible, high-performance computing (HPC) is one area that can help you save time and money.
It’s already paying dividends across the industry. Thanks to supercomputing, digital technologies such as advanced sensors and data analytics can increase oil and gas production by up to 8 percent, reduce facility capital costs by up to 3 percent and lower operating costs by anywhere from 5 percent to 25 percent. Our high-performance offerings include InfiniBand architecture, 10 Gig-E switching, solid-state memory, high-availability/high-volume storage, high-performance servers and power management systems.
Discover more benefits of high-performance computing. Read about it.

We collaborate with leading technology brands to design IT solutions that fit your business and budget.
