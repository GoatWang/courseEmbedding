Steelhead Partners, founded in 1996 and based in Bellevue, Washington, seeks to outperform the market using fundamental, balance-sheet-based analysis and an independent thought process to build portfolios. Our investment style is characterized by finding names that are out-of-favor and underfollowed by Wall Street; historically, this has consistently led us to opportunities with exceptional risk/reward profiles.  Our firm takes its name from an ocean-going trout found in the western United 
	States. To return to their native fresh water streams, Steelhead must successfully swim against the current. This embodies our investing style. At Steelhead Partners, we will not allow ourselves to be swept along with the crowd. We avoid consensus thinking and believe our contrarian strategies will be highly rewarding to our long-term investors.

("Steelhead Navigator") announced today the conversion of US$4,420,705 principal amount of convertible debentures ("CDs") of Gold Reserve Inc. (the "Issuer") into 1,473,568 Class A common shares of the Issuer ("Shares"). The Issuer confirmed to Steelhead on July 18, 2017 that the CDs were converted into Shares, pursuant to their terms, on the election of Steelhead to convert on July 12, 2017. Previously, Steelhead, on behalf of Steelhead Navigator, exercised control and direction over 5,776,350 Shares and US$12,986,744 principal amount of CDs, convertible into 4,328,915 Shares and, on behalf of another client account, exercised control and direction over an additional 1,555,351 Shares.  Following conversion of the CDs as described above, Steelhead, on behalf of Steelhead Navigator, exercises control and direction over 7,249,918 Shares and US$6,946,497 principal amount of CDs convertible into 2,315,499 Shares. Steelhead, on behalf of another client account, exercises control and direction over an additional 1,555,351 Shares. The 7,249,918 Shares controlled on behalf of Steelhead Navigator together with the 1,555,351 Shares controlled on behalf of the other client account represent in aggregate 9.54% of the current issued and outstanding Shares (assuming 92.3 million Shares currently outstanding as reported by the Issuer), and assuming the conversion of the CDs, Steelhead would exercise control and direction over 11.75% of the issued and outstanding Shares (taking into account the conversion Shares as part of the total outstanding).  Steelhead, on behalf of Steelhead Navigator, holds a contingent value right entitling Steelhead to, among other rights, 3.506% of proceeds received by the Issuer, net of certain deductions, with respect to an arbitration award and a mining data sale, as further described in its report filed on January 2, 2013, which is available under the Issuer's profile at www.sedar.com.  A report on Form 62-103F1 - Required Disclosure under the Early Warning Requirements is being filed by Steelhead in accordance with applicable securities laws and will be available under the Issuer's profile at www.sedar.com.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
