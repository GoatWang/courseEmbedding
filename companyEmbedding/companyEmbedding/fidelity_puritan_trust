Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 727 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks income and capital growth consistent with reasonable risk.




Strategy



Investing approximately 60% of assets in stocks and other equity securities and the remainder in bonds and other debt securities, including lower-quality debt securities, when its outlook is neutral. Investing at least 25% of total assets in fixed-income senior securities (including debt securities and preferred stock). Engaging in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the fund.


Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Fixed income investments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), the risk of issuer default, issuer credit risk and inflation risk. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater risk of default than higher-quality bonds. Leverage can increase market exposure and magnify investment risk.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Fixed income investments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), the risk of issuer default, issuer credit risk and inflation risk. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater risk of default than higher-quality bonds. Leverage can increase market exposure and magnify investment risk.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee Fidelity funds are available without paying a trading fee to Fidelity or a sales load to the fund. However, the fund may charge a short-term trading or redemption fee to protect the interests of long-term shareholders of the fund. Shares are subject to the fund's management and operating expenses. See Expenses & Fees for more information.
2. The funds on the Fund Picks From Fidelity® list are selected based on certain selection criteria. Fund Picks From Fidelity is not a personalized recommendation or endorsement of any fund for an investor's individual circumstances.
3. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
4. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
5. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
6. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. There is no minimum for additional investments in any type of Fidelity fund you already own.
7. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
8. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
9. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
10. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
11. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
12. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
13. Credit ratings for a rated issuer or security are categorized using the highest credit rating among the following three Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSRO"): Moody's Investors Service (Moody's); Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P); or Fitch, Inc.  Securities that are not rated by any of these three NRSRO's (e.g. equity securities, if held) are categorized as Not Rated.  All U.S. government securities are included in the U.S. Government category. The table information is based on the combined investments of the fund and its pro rata share of any investments in other Fidelity funds.
14. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
15. Fixed Income StyleMap® StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
16. Fidelity may deduct a small balance maintenance fee of $12.00 from a fund balance with a value less than $2,000.  Fund positions opened after September 30 will not be subject to the fee for that calendar year.  This fee will not be deducted from fund positions opened after January 1 of that calendar year if those positions use regular investment plans.  Refer to the fund prospectus for details.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Probiotic Supplement Buyer’s Guide








For July 2017
Which Probiotic Supplement Works Best?
Probiotic Supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance. The good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved, the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising. Our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements. We received encouraging reports from users all over the country. Amazingly, these pills seem to work.
And though we love when new natural alternatives come to market, it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health. These companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group. To make matters worse, many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective, rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health. 
With so many different brands, we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review.

Top 5 Signs You Should Be Taking Probiotics

Taken antibiotics, anti-inflammatory (pain meds) or birth control in the last few years.
Experienced digestive issues, such as constipation, diarrhea, gas, bloating, upset stomach, or have even had food poisoning at some point. 
Noticing skin blemishes, acne, dullness in skin, Rosacea, Psoriasis, or Eczema.
Feeling depressed, moody, irritable, brain fog or low energy. 
Get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year.

The Importance of a “Balanced Gut”
Our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body. The gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components (carbohydrates, fats, proteins), which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration. It also regulates hormones and activates the immune system. Our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses). When in balance, the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes, yeasts, and parasites which can cause an imbalance. 
What is “Leaky Gut” Syndrome?
Our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream. Leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance, allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream. Our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response, building up antibodies to fight back. The problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones. As these attacks continue over time, it can lead to a variety of health problems. 
A “Leaky Gut” May Not Be Your Fault
The reality is that antibiotics, pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut. The processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients. Chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe, sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin, to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes. 
All of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria, leading to gut and immune system disruption. The results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and heartburn. The internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne, Rosacea, Psoriasis and even Eczema. And if all of that was not bad enough, an imbalance in your gut microbiome can result in depression, low energy, and memory and recall issues. This is why it is critical to re-balance your gut with a “quality” probiotic. 
“Good Gut” Bacteria SECRETS You May Not Have Known

You have more nerves in your gut than you do in your entire spinal cord.
Your gut has 100 trillion bacteria, 3 pounds worth, and all those cells are more than the human cells that can be found in the rest of your entire body. That’s a lot of cells in your gut!
Having good gut bacteria dictates how well your immune system will function. 
Want glowing and clear skin? Good bacteria plays a vital role in the appearance of your skin. 
A surprising 95% of the serotonin, the happy molecule in your brain, is made in your gut! Balance your gut with good bacteria and you can help improve your mood and achieve more mental clarity. 

How Probiotic Supplements Work
Probiotics supplements contain live strains of “good bacteria,” delivered to your gut in a convenient daily pill, which can help to balance your intestinal microbiome. Building your gut with more friendly bacteria can help prevent the over-colonization of “bad bacteria” which is a major factor in how well your immune system can respond to invading harmful pathogens and fight prevent infections. Research has shown that an optimal balance in your gut is 85% “good” bacteria to 15% “bad” bacteria. Although the perfect percentage may vary for each individual person, the most important objective to achieve health is to create an environment for healthy bacteria to flourish. It is essential to choose a high-quality probiotic brand, with the correct strains in the correct proportions, to help bring your gut flora back into balance and prevent the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria.  
Our Probiotic Research Approach
To determine which probiotics were effective and which were just marketing hype we first investigated the brands to asses if the ingredients in the pills themselves were the same as their labels claimed. Second, we surveyed customers who have used these brands over time to get a better understanding of their experiences. Lastly, we took a close look at online marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay to see what other actual customers were saying.
We then combined all these factors so we could properly review the best Probiotic Supplement products available today.
6 Essential Ingredient Criteria to a Quality Probiotic
Probiotics are live microorganisms if taken in the correct amounts can help re-culture your gut by building up the “good gut bacteria” yielding a wide array of health benefits. But, our research and analysis has shown that for a probiotic supplement to be effective, it must have meet these 5 key ingredient criteria:

Number of CFUs: Colony-Forming Units (CFUs) indicate how dense or potent the bacteria in the probiotic is. The higher number of CFUs in a probiotic can mean it has a higher impact on the growth of “good bacteria” within your gut flora. Our research indicated that although many companies try to sell you on simply the number of CFUs they have, the critical number to have in a good probiotic supplement is 40 Billion CFUs. Anything above that and you are just paying for marketing hype as it has not been shown to be more effective. 


 Multiple Strains: A recent study by Stanford University’s Dr. David Relman discovered that the gut contains thousands of unique strains of bacteria. A probiotic brand that has at least 12 different strains is optimal. Keep in mind that if you have a specific digestive issue, there may be certain strains that are more recognized for their ability to fight the bad bacteria that are causing your issues. 


Substrains: One of the signs of a quality probiotic brand is if the company lists the specific substrain for each probiotic strain noted on their label. A substrain is an indication that the specific probiotic strain being used in the formula has gone through clinical studies to insure its quality. Avoid brands that do not list the substrain. It is usually an indication that a generic lower quality strains are being used. To find the substrain, examine the supplement facts portion of a brands label. As shown in the example below, the substrain will be located to the right of each strain, followed by a trademark symbol: Bifidobacterium lactis BI-04™


Prebiotics: Since probiotics are living microorganisms, they need food to stay alive and to grow in your gut. A “prebiotic” is a soluble fiber which probiotics feed upon to stimulate their growth in your gut. Prebiotics are like the gas you put in your car, without it, you won’t go far for long. A good probiotic brand needs to contain prebiotics, such as the popular NutraFlora™ fiber, for it be most effective at re-culturing your gut with good bacteria. 


Dark Amber Glass Bottle: Probiotics are extremely sensitive to light, moisture, and oxygen. These harmful elements can easily leak through plastic bottles during storage and shipping and cause the living probiotic microorganisms to die. Only a dark amber glass bottle can keep out harmful moisture and light.  Plastic bottles can render probiotics useless as they are permeable to varying degrees of moisture. Don’t waste your hard-earned money by taking the risk with a plastic bottle. Your safest choice is a brand which uses a dark amber glass bottle. 


Non-Refrigeration: It is important to take a probiotic “each day with consistency” to maintain optimal gut flora. We have heard from many of our readers about the challenges with probiotics which require refrigeration. Today, technology has advanced the ability to freeze dry probiotics and allowing them to be stable at room temperature. A good quality probiotic which does not require refrigeration can be effective and will increase the likelihood you will take it each day like any of your other vitamins. 




BEWARE OF Dead Probiotics: There have been reports of companies failing to store or ship their probiotics properly, causing the essential colony-forming units (CFUs) in them to die, leaving customer with useless products. Don’t let yourself become a victim!



Key Indicators of a “Trustworthy Brand”
Customer Satisfaction: We gathered thousands of Inclusion of Prebiotics from online marketplaces to determine which had the most top rated reviews so we can see which products really work. You want a company with an established reputation. If they don’t have positive reviews, avoid buying from them.
Money-Back Guarantee: It is important to find a company who has a “no hassle” money-back guarantee. You don’t want to be wasting your time arguing with a company that won’t let you return a product that is not working for you. If a company won’t stand behind their product with a guarantee, take that as a red flag. The #1 rated brand in our rankings below has an industry leading, no questions asked, 1-Year money back guarantee. We love when we see brands who are committed to standing behind their products. 
Third-Party Quality Testing. Probiotics are live organisms and will begin to die off over time of they sit for long periods on a shelf. A good brand will guarantee that the CFUs they claim their product contains will test out to the claim amount for at least 1-year from the date of purchase. It’s important to know that what a company advertises, is actually in the pill! Be sure to pick a company who has third-party testing and verification of the ingredients on their label.
Lastly, we sought out real customers who used these products, and asked them about their experiences and results. Our team then reviewed all the responses, results and metrics.
The Results of Our Research
Our review process eliminated most of the brands we reviewed. After a thorough analysis, these are the top-rated probiotic brands we feel you can confidently choose from. Customers who used our highest rated brands have reported results ranging from improved digestion and bowel movements, clearer and more glowing skin, higher energy levels, better mental clarity and an overall more optimistic mood. They also had a positive buying experience and many reported seeing results in as little as a few weeks.

Helpful Tips on Maintaining a Balanced Gut Flora

Reduce Stress – The stress of daily life and holding onto negative emotions can constrict your gut and restricts digestion in our intestinal tract. Take a few moments each day to close your eyes and breathe deeply. Getting at least 7 – 8 hours of sleep per night can also help your gut health as it resets the natural hormones in your body.
Healthy Diet – For optimal digestive health, include six daily servings of brightly colored fruits and vegetables, fermented foods, as well as healthy fats such as avocado, salmon and coconut oil.
Krill Oil – Add a quality Krill Oil supplement to your routine for heart, brain and overall vitality.
Regular Exercise – When you move more frequently you stimulate your digestional tract, helping ease bowel movements and eliminating toxins from your body.
Take Your Probiotics Daily – To maintain a consistent balance between the good and bad bacteria in your gut, it is important to take your probiotics daily, without interrupting your routine. Once you have achieved a balance gut flora, you don’t want to let yourself slip back to experiencing the negative effects of a leaky gut.

BEWARE OF Dead Probiotics: There have been reports of companies failing to store or ship their probiotics properly, causing the essential colony-forming units (CFUs) in them to die, leaving customer with useless products. Don’t let yourself become a victim!



Key Indicators of a “Trustworthy Brand”
Customer Satisfaction: We gathered thousands of Inclusion of Prebiotics from online marketplaces to determine which had the most top rated reviews so we can see which products really work. You want a company with an established reputation. If they don’t have positive reviews, avoid buying from them.
Money-Back Guarantee: It is important to find a company who has a “no hassle” money-back guarantee. You don’t want to be wasting your time arguing with a company that won’t let you return a product that is not working for you. If a company won’t stand behind their product with a guarantee, take that as a red flag. The #1 rated brand in our rankings below has an industry leading, no questions asked, 1-Year money back guarantee. We love when we see brands who are committed to standing behind their products. 
Third-Party Quality Testing. Probiotics are live organisms and will begin to die off over time of they sit for long periods on a shelf. A good brand will guarantee that the CFUs they claim their product contains will test out to the claim amount for at least 1-year from the date of purchase. It’s important to know that what a company advertises, is actually in the pill! Be sure to pick a company who has third-party testing and verification of the ingredients on their label.
Lastly, we sought out real customers who used these products, and asked them about their experiences and results. Our team then reviewed all the responses, results and metrics.

Our review process eliminated most of the brands we reviewed. After a thorough analysis, these are the top-rated probiotic brands we feel you can confidently choose from. Customers who used our highest rated brands have reported results ranging from improved digestion and bowel movements, clearer and more glowing skin, higher energy levels, better mental clarity and an overall more optimistic mood.

Helpful Tips on Maintaining a Balanced Gut Flora

Reduce Stress – The stress of daily life and holding onto negative emotions can constrict your gut and restricts digestion in our intestinal tract. Take a few moments each day to close your eyes and breathe deeply. Getting at least 7 – 8 hours of sleep per night can also help your gut health as it resets the natural hormones in your body.
Healthy Diet – For optimal digestive health, include six daily servings of brightly colored fruits and vegetables, fermented foods, as well as healthy fats such as avocado, salmon and coconut oil.
Krill Oil – Add a quality Krill Oil supplement to your routine for heart, brain and overall vitality.
Regular Exercise – When you move more frequently you stimulate your digestional tract, helping ease bowel movements and eliminating toxins from your body.
Take Your Probiotics Daily – To maintain a consistent balance between the good and bad bacteria in your gut, it is important to take your probiotics daily, without interrupting your routine. Once you have achieved a balance gut flora, you don’t want to let yourself slip back to experiencing the negative effects of a leaky gut.

Probiotic Supplement Buyer’s Guide








For July 2017
Which Probiotic Supplement Works Best?
Probiotic Supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance. The good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved, the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising. Our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements. We received encouraging reports from users all over the country. Amazingly, these pills seem to work.
And though we love when new natural alternatives come to market, it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health. These companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group. To make matters worse, many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective, rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health. 
With so many different brands, we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review.

Top 5 Signs You Should Be Taking Probiotics

Taken antibiotics, anti-inflammatory (pain meds) or birth control in the last few years.
Experienced digestive issues, such as constipation, diarrhea, gas, bloating, upset stomach, or have even had food poisoning at some point. 
Noticing skin blemishes, acne, dullness in skin, Rosacea, Psoriasis, or Eczema.
Feeling depressed, moody, irritable, brain fog or low energy. 
Get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year.

The Importance of a “Balanced Gut”
Our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body. The gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components (carbohydrates, fats, proteins), which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration. It also regulates hormones and activates the immune system. Our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses). When in balance, the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes, yeasts, and parasites which can cause an imbalance. 
What is “Leaky Gut” Syndrome?
Our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream. Leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance, allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream. Our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response, building up antibodies to fight back. The problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones. As these attacks continue over time, it can lead to a variety of health problems. 
A “Leaky Gut” May Not Be Your Fault
The reality is that antibiotics, pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut. The processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients. Chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe, sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin, to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes. 
All of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria, leading to gut and immune system disruption. The results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and heartburn. The internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne, Rosacea, Psoriasis and even Eczema. And if all of that was not bad enough, an imbalance in your gut microbiome can result in depression, low energy, and memory and recall issues. This is why it is critical to re-balance your gut with a “quality” probiotic. 
“Good Gut” Bacteria SECRETS You May Not Have Known

You have more nerves in your gut than you do in your entire spinal cord.
Your gut has 100 trillion bacteria, 3 pounds worth, and all those cells are more than the human cells that can be found in the rest of your entire body. That’s a lot of cells in your gut!
Having good gut bacteria dictates how well your immune system will function. 
Want glowing and clear skin? Good bacteria plays a vital role in the appearance of your skin. 
A surprising 95% of the serotonin, the happy molecule in your brain, is made in your gut! Balance your gut with good bacteria and you can help improve your mood and achieve more mental clarity. 

How Probiotic Supplements Work
Probiotics supplements contain live strains of “good bacteria,” delivered to your gut in a convenient daily pill, which can help to balance your intestinal microbiome. Building your gut with more friendly bacteria can help prevent the over-colonization of “bad bacteria” which is a major factor in how well your immune system can respond to invading harmful pathogens and fight prevent infections. Research has shown that an optimal balance in your gut is 85% “good” bacteria to 15% “bad” bacteria. Although the perfect percentage may vary for each individual person, the most important objective to achieve health is to create an environment for healthy bacteria to flourish. It is essential to choose a high-quality probiotic brand, with the correct strains in the correct proportions, to help bring your gut flora back into balance and prevent the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria.  
Our Probiotic Research Approach
To determine which probiotics were effective and which were just marketing hype we first investigated the brands to asses if the ingredients in the pills themselves were the same as their labels claimed. Second, we surveyed customers who have used these brands over time to get a better understanding of their experiences. Lastly, we took a close look at online marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay to see what other actual customers were saying.
We then combined all these factors so we could properly review the best Probiotic Supplement products available today.
6 Essential Ingredient Criteria to a Quality Probiotic
Probiotics are live microorganisms if taken in the correct amounts can help re-culture your gut by building up the “good gut bacteria” yielding a wide array of health benefits. But, our research and analysis has shown that for a probiotic supplement to be effective, it must have meet these 5 key ingredient criteria:

Number of CFUs: Colony-Forming Units (CFUs) indicate how dense or potent the bacteria in the probiotic is. The higher number of CFUs in a probiotic can mean it has a higher impact on the growth of “good bacteria” within your gut flora. Our research indicated that although many companies try to sell you on simply the number of CFUs they have, the critical number to have in a good probiotic supplement is 40 Billion CFUs. Anything above that and you are just paying for marketing hype as it has not been shown to be more effective. 


 Multiple Strains: A recent study by Stanford University’s Dr. David Relman discovered that the gut contains thousands of unique strains of bacteria. A probiotic brand that has at least 12 different strains is optimal. Keep in mind that if you have a specific digestive issue, there may be certain strains that are more recognized for their ability to fight the bad bacteria that are causing your issues. 


Substrains: One of the signs of a quality probiotic brand is if the company lists the specific substrain for each probiotic strain noted on their label. A substrain is an indication that the specific probiotic strain being used in the formula has gone through clinical studies to insure its quality. Avoid brands that do not list the substrain. It is usually an indication that a generic lower quality strains are being used. To find the substrain, examine the supplement facts portion of a brands label. As shown in the example below, the substrain will be located to the right of each strain, followed by a trademark symbol: Bifidobacterium lactis BI-04™


Prebiotics: Since probiotics are living microorganisms, they need food to stay alive and to grow in your gut. A “prebiotic” is a soluble fiber which probiotics feed upon to stimulate their growth in your gut. Prebiotics are like the gas you put in your car, without it, you won’t go far for long. A good probiotic brand needs to contain prebiotics, such as the popular NutraFlora™ fiber, for it be most effective at re-culturing your gut with good bacteria. 


Dark Amber Glass Bottle: Probiotics are extremely sensitive to light, moisture, and oxygen. These harmful elements can easily leak through plastic bottles during storage and shipping and cause the living probiotic microorganisms to die. Only a dark amber glass bottle can keep out harmful moisture and light.  Plastic bottles can render probiotics useless as they are permeable to varying degrees of moisture. Don’t waste your hard-earned money by taking the risk with a plastic bottle. Your safest choice is a brand which uses a dark amber glass bottle. 


Non-Refrigeration: It is important to take a probiotic “each day with consistency” to maintain optimal gut flora. We have heard from many of our readers about the challenges with probiotics which require refrigeration. Today, technology has advanced the ability to freeze dry probiotics and allowing them to be stable at room temperature. A good quality probiotic which does not require refrigeration can be effective and will increase the likelihood you will take it each day like any of your other vitamins. 




BEWARE OF Dead Probiotics: There have been reports of companies failing to store or ship their probiotics properly, causing the essential colony-forming units (CFUs) in them to die, leaving customer with useless products. Don’t let yourself become a victim!



Key Indicators of a “Trustworthy Brand”
Customer Satisfaction: We gathered thousands of Inclusion of Prebiotics from online marketplaces to determine which had the most top rated reviews so we can see which products really work. You want a company with an established reputation. If they don’t have positive reviews, avoid buying from them.

If a company won’t stand behind their product with a guarantee, take that as a red flag. The #1 rated brand in our rankings below has an industry leading, no questions asked, 1-Year money back guarantee. We love when we see brands who are committed to standing behind their products.

A good brand will guarantee that the CFUs they claim their product contains will test out to the claim amount for at least 1-year from the date of purchase.

Fidelity® Puritan® Fund - Class K


Symbol: FPUKX











































Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 727 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.





3 Yrs





                         Out of
727
 funds

                         Out of

                         Out of
429
 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.







How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks income and capital growth consistent with reasonable risk.




Strategy



Investing approximately 60% of assets in stocks and other equity securities and the remainder in bonds and other debt securities, including lower-quality debt securities, when its outlook is neutral. Investing at least 25% of total assets in fixed-income senior securities (including debt securities and preferred stock). Engaging in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the fund.


Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Fixed income investments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), the risk of issuer default, issuer credit risk and inflation risk. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater risk of default than higher-quality bonds. Leverage can increase market exposure and magnify investment risk.



Short Term Redemption Fee
None



Who May Want To Invest

Someone who is seeking to invest in a fund that invests in both stocks and bonds.
Someone who is seeking the potential both for income and for long-term share-price appreciation and who is willing to accept the volatility of the bond and stock markets.

Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
On May 9, 2008, an initial offering of the retirement (K) class took place.  Returns and expenses prior to that date are those of the non-K, non-advisor class. Had K class expenses been reflected in the returns shown, total returns would have been higher.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
2. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
3. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
4. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
5. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
6. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
7. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
8. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
9. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
10. Credit ratings for a rated issuer or security are categorized using the highest credit rating among the following three Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSRO"): Moody's Investors Service (Moody's); Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P); or Fitch, Inc.  Securities that are not rated by any of these three NRSRO's (e.g. equity securities, if held) are categorized as Not Rated.  All U.S. government securities are included in the U.S. Government category. The table information is based on the combined investments of the fund and its pro rata share of any investments in other Fidelity funds.
11. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
12. Fixed Income StyleMap® StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, the issuer of a mutual fund is the fund or trust which issues the shares; the issuer of collective investment trusts is the underlying trust or investment vehicle which issues the units; the issuer of a stock fund is the company which issues the shares; the issuer of options such as separate accounts and strategies is the plan which makes them available; the issuer of a fixed return option is the insurance company or other company which offers the investment; the issuer of an annuity contract is the insurance company and/or the insurance company separate account.

Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Probiotic Pill Reviews 

 




 







Probiotic Supplement Buyer’s Guide








For July 2017
Which Probiotic Supplement Works Best?
Probiotic Supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance. The good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved, the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising. Our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements. We received encouraging reports from users all over the country. Amazingly, these pills seem to work.
And though we love when new natural alternatives come to market, it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health. These companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group. To make matters worse, many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective, rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health. 
With so many different brands, we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review.

Top 5 Signs You Should Be Taking Probiotics

Taken antibiotics, anti-inflammatory (pain meds) or birth control in the last few years.
Experienced digestive issues, such as constipation, diarrhea, gas, bloating, upset stomach, or have even had food poisoning at some point. 
Noticing skin blemishes, acne, dullness in skin, Rosacea, Psoriasis, or Eczema.
Feeling depressed, moody, irritable, brain fog or low energy. 
Get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year.

The Importance of a “Balanced Gut”
Our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body. The gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components (carbohydrates, fats, proteins), which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration. It also regulates hormones and activates the immune system. Our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses). When in balance, the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes, yeasts, and parasites which can cause an imbalance. 
What is “Leaky Gut” Syndrome?
Our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream. Leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance, allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream. Our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response, building up antibodies to fight back. The problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones. As these attacks continue over time, it can lead to a variety of health problems. 
A “Leaky Gut” May Not Be Your Fault
The reality is that antibiotics, pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut. The processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients. Chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe, sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin, to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes. 
All of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria, leading to gut and immune system disruption. The results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and heartburn. The internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne, Rosacea, Psoriasis and even Eczema. And if all of that was not bad enough, an imbalance in your gut microbiome can result in depression, low energy, and memory and recall issues. This is why it is critical to re-balance your gut with a “quality” probiotic. 
“Good Gut” Bacteria SECRETS You May Not Have Known

You have more nerves in your gut than you do in your entire spinal cord.
Your gut has 100 trillion bacteria, 3 pounds worth, and all those cells are more than the human cells that can be found in the rest of your entire body. That’s a lot of cells in your gut!
Having good gut bacteria dictates how well your immune system will function. 
Want glowing and clear skin? Good bacteria plays a vital role in the appearance of your skin. 
A surprising 95% of the serotonin, the happy molecule in your brain, is made in your gut! Balance your gut with good bacteria and you can help improve your mood and achieve more mental clarity. 

How Probiotic Supplements Work
Probiotics supplements contain live strains of “good bacteria,” delivered to your gut in a convenient daily pill, which can help to balance your intestinal microbiome. Building your gut with more friendly bacteria can help prevent the over-colonization of “bad bacteria” which is a major factor in how well your immune system can respond to invading harmful pathogens and fight prevent infections. Research has shown that an optimal balance in your gut is 85% “good” bacteria to 15% “bad” bacteria. Although the perfect percentage may vary for each individual person, the most important objective to achieve health is to create an environment for healthy bacteria to flourish. It is essential to choose a high-quality probiotic brand, with the correct strains in the correct proportions, to help bring your gut flora back into balance and prevent the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria.  
Our Probiotic Research Approach
To determine which probiotics were effective and which were just marketing hype we first investigated the brands to asses if the ingredients in the pills themselves were the same as their labels claimed. Second, we surveyed customers who have used these brands over time to get a better understanding of their experiences. Lastly, we took a close look at online marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay to see what other actual customers were saying.
We then combined all these factors so we could properly review the best Probiotic Supplement products available today.
6 Essential Ingredient Criteria to a Quality Probiotic
Probiotics are live microorganisms if taken in the correct amounts can help re-culture your gut by building up the “good gut bacteria” yielding a wide array of health benefits. But, our research and analysis has shown that for a probiotic supplement to be effective, it must have meet these 5 key ingredient criteria:

Number of CFUs: Colony-Forming Units (CFUs) indicate how dense or potent the bacteria in the probiotic is. The higher number of CFUs in a probiotic can mean it has a higher impact on the growth of “good bacteria” within your gut flora. Our research indicated that although many companies try to sell you on simply the number of CFUs they have, the critical number to have in a good probiotic supplement is 40 Billion CFUs. Anything above that and you are just paying for marketing hype as it has not been shown to be more effective. 


 Multiple Strains: A recent study by Stanford University’s Dr. David Relman discovered that the gut contains thousands of unique strains of bacteria. A probiotic brand that has at least 12 different strains is optimal. Keep in mind that if you have a specific digestive issue, there may be certain strains that are more recognized for their ability to fight the bad bacteria that are causing your issues. 


Substrains: One of the signs of a quality probiotic brand is if the company lists the specific substrain for each probiotic strain noted on their label. A substrain is an indication that the specific probiotic strain being used in the formula has gone through clinical studies to insure its quality. Avoid brands that do not list the substrain. It is usually an indication that a generic lower quality strains are being used. To find the substrain, examine the supplement facts portion of a brands label. As shown in the example below, the substrain will be located to the right of each strain, followed by a trademark symbol: Bifidobacterium lactis BI-04™


Prebiotics: Since probiotics are living microorganisms, they need food to stay alive and to grow in your gut. A “prebiotic” is a soluble fiber which probiotics feed upon to stimulate their growth in your gut. Prebiotics are like the gas you put in your car, without it, you won’t go far for long. A good probiotic brand needs to contain prebiotics, such as the popular NutraFlora™ fiber, for it be most effective at re-culturing your gut with good bacteria. 


Dark Amber Glass Bottle: Probiotics are extremely sensitive to light, moisture, and oxygen. These harmful elements can easily leak through plastic bottles during storage and shipping and cause the living probiotic microorganisms to die. Only a dark amber glass bottle can keep out harmful moisture and light.  Plastic bottles can render probiotics useless as they are permeable to varying degrees of moisture. Don’t waste your hard-earned money by taking the risk with a plastic bottle. Your safest choice is a brand which uses a dark amber glass bottle. 


Non-Refrigeration: It is important to take a probiotic “each day with consistency” to maintain optimal gut flora. We have heard from many of our readers about the challenges with probiotics which require refrigeration. Today, technology has advanced the ability to freeze dry probiotics and allowing them to be stable at room temperature. A good quality probiotic which does not require refrigeration can be effective and will increase the likelihood you will take it each day like any of your other vitamins. 




BEWARE OF Dead Probiotics: There have been reports of companies failing to store or ship their probiotics properly, causing the essential colony-forming units (CFUs) in them to die, leaving customer with useless products. Don’t let yourself become a victim!



Key Indicators of a “Trustworthy Brand”
Customer Satisfaction: We gathered thousands of Inclusion of Prebiotics from online marketplaces to determine which had the most top rated reviews so we can see which products really work. You want a company with an established reputation. If they don’t have positive reviews, avoid buying from them.
Money-Back Guarantee: It is important to find a company who has a “no hassle” money-back guarantee. You don’t want to be wasting your time arguing with a company that won’t let you return a product that is not working for you. If a company won’t stand behind their product with a guarantee, take that as a red flag. The #1 rated brand in our rankings below has an industry leading, no questions asked, 1-Year money back guarantee. We love when we see brands who are committed to standing behind their products. 
Third-Party Quality Testing. Probiotics are live organisms and will begin to die off over time of they sit for long periods on a shelf. A good brand will guarantee that the CFUs they claim their product contains will test out to the claim amount for at least 1-year from the date of purchase. It’s important to know that what a company advertises, is actually in the pill! Be sure to pick a company who has third-party testing and verification of the ingredients on their label.
Lastly, we sought out real customers who used these products, and asked them about their experiences and results. Our team then reviewed all the responses, results and metrics.
The Results of Our Research
Our review process eliminated most of the brands we reviewed. After a thorough analysis, these are the top-rated probiotic brands we feel you can confidently choose from. Customers who used our highest rated brands have reported results ranging from improved digestion and bowel movements, clearer and more glowing skin, higher energy levels, better mental clarity and an overall more optimistic mood. They also had a positive buying experience and many reported seeing results in as little as a few weeks.

Helpful Tips on Maintaining a Balanced Gut Flora

Reduce Stress – The stress of daily life and holding onto negative emotions can constrict your gut and restricts digestion in our intestinal tract. Take a few moments each day to close your eyes and breathe deeply. Getting at least 7 – 8 hours of sleep per night can also help your gut health as it resets the natural hormones in your body.
Healthy Diet – For optimal digestive health, include six daily servings of brightly colored fruits and vegetables, fermented foods, as well as healthy fats such as avocado, salmon and coconut oil.
Krill Oil – Add a quality Krill Oil supplement to your routine for heart, brain and overall vitality.
Regular Exercise – When you move more frequently you stimulate your digestional tract, helping ease bowel movements and eliminating toxins from your body.
Take Your Probiotics Daily – To maintain a consistent balance between the good and bad bacteria in your gut, it is important to take your probiotics daily, without interrupting your routine. Once you have achieved a balance gut flora, you don’t want to let yourself slip back to experiencing the negative effects of a leaky gut.
