A Christopher & Banks store at a mall in Oregon


Christopher & Banks is an American retail company based in the Minneapolis suburb of Plymouth, Minnesota that specializes in women's clothing for the age 40-60 demographic.[1] In 2017, Joel Waller was named Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the Board of Directors.[2]
History[edit]
The chain was founded in 1956 as Braun's Fashions in Minneapolis. It became a publicly traded company in 1992, and was re-branded as Christopher & Banks in 2000.[3] Also in 2000, the chain founded a second brand, CJ Banks, which is a plus-size clothing store.[4]
In November 2004 Christopher & Banks acquired the Acorn Stores chain and operated it as a third retail concept.[5] Christopher & Banks announced on July 31, 2008 that they intended to close Acorn and followed through with this plan, closing all 36 Acorn stores by the end of the year.[6]
On April 4, 2005, The Company restated its consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended March 1, 2003 and February 28, 2004, as well as for interim periods within the fiscal year ended February 26, 2005, to present the amortization of construction allowances as a reduction of rent expense instead of a reduction of depreciation expense.[7]
In 2014, the company began phasing out CJ Banks stores, and combining the plus-size lines into Christopher & Banks stores. In cases where such stores were adjacent, the stores were combined into one larger store.[8]

A Christopher & Banks store at a mall in Oregon


Christopher & Banks is an American retail company based in the Minneapolis suburb of Plymouth, Minnesota that specializes in women's clothing for the age 40-60 demographic.[1] In 2017, Joel Waller was named Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the Board of Directors.[2]
History[edit]
The chain was founded in 1956 as Braun's Fashions in Minneapolis. It became a publicly traded company in 1992, and was re-branded as Christopher & Banks in 2000.[3] Also in 2000, the chain founded a second brand, CJ Banks, which is a plus-size clothing store.[4]
In November 2004 Christopher & Banks acquired the Acorn Stores chain and operated it as a third retail concept.[5] Christopher & Banks announced on July 31, 2008 that they intended to close Acorn and followed through with this plan, closing all 36 Acorn stores by the end of the year.[6]
On April 4, 2005, The Company restated its consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended March 1, 2003 and February 28, 2004, as well as for interim periods within the fiscal year ended February 26, 2005, to present the amortization of construction allowances as a reduction of rent expense instead of a reduction of depreciation expense.[7]
In 2014, the company began phasing out CJ Banks stores, and combining the plus-size lines into Christopher & Banks stores. In cases where such stores were adjacent, the stores were combined into one larger store.[8]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
