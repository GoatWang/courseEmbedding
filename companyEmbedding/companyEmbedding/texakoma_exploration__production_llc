Exploration, operation, development and production of oil and natural gas in the United States.
Since 1982, the Texakoma Group1 (“Texakoma”) has established and grown our oil and gas exploration, operation and production business around our greatest asset, our people. Behind Texakoma’s Executive Management team and our core of industry respected and veteran engineers, geologists, landmen and professional staff – many having over 20 years with Texakoma – we have been able to find, explore and develop numerous oil and gas fields in states such as Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Pennsylvania.
Texakoma was one of the top coal bed methane gas producers in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico before selling that asset (which included 22,000 acres under lease with 71 producing wells and gross reserves of 170 bcf) to POGO Producing Co. in 20042. Since 2012, we have been among the largest oil producers in Roberts County, Texas3.
Texakoma continues to utilize cutting-edge geological and engineering data and techniques to increase and expand our oil and gas operations domestically.

New MexicoTexakoma drilled over 55 producing wells in New Mexico; the most noteworthy are those in the San Juan Basin within the non-traditional reservoir known as the Fruitland Coal. Introducing hydraulic fracturing to the area improved effectiveness of drilling in this area and uncovered unforeseen potential in oil production. Due to the high-production outcomes of drilling practices initiated by Texakoma’s engineering team, this area was purchased by POGO Producing in 2004.

Exploration, operation, development and production of oil and natural gas in the United States.
Since 1982, the Texakoma Group1 (“Texakoma”) has established and grown our oil and gas exploration, operation and production business around our greatest asset, our people. Behind Texakoma’s Executive Management team and our core of industry respected and veteran engineers, geologists, landmen and professional staff – many having over 20 years with Texakoma – we have been able to find, explore and develop numerous oil and gas fields in states such as Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Pennsylvania.
Texakoma was one of the top coal bed methane gas producers in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico before selling that asset (which included 22,000 acres under lease with 71 producing wells and gross reserves of 170 bcf) to POGO Producing Co. in 20042. Since 2012, we have been among the largest oil producers in Roberts County, Texas3.
Texakoma continues to utilize cutting-edge geological and engineering data and techniques to increase and expand our oil and gas operations domestically.
