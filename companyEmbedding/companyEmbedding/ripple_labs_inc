FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tuesday, May 5, 2015 
Ripple Labs Inc. Resolves Criminal Investigation 
Ripple Labs Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, XRP II LLC, formerly XRP Fund II LLC, have agreed to resolve a criminal investigation in exchange for a settlement agreement calling for a series of substantial remedial measures, including a migration of a portion of Ripple’s virtual currency business to a separate entity, the company’s ongoing cooperation in other investigations, an extensive remedial framework to ensure future compliance with federal laws and forfeiture and penalties totaling $700,000, announced U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag of the Northern District of California, Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery of the U.S. Treasury Department Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation Division.  The agreement will resolve allegations that Ripple and its subsidiary failed to follow the law while engaging in the exchange of virtual currency and that the entities failed to establish and maintain an appropriate anti-money laundering program.
Ripple Labs Inc. is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and developed and sold virtual currency known as “XRP.”  As of 2015, the currency of the Ripple network, XRP, is the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization. 
The agreement formalizes the steps Ripple and its subsidiary must take to bring its virtual currency operation within the existing regulatory framework for money services businesses.  The agreement consists of a settlement agreement, an agreed statement of facts, and a remedial framework for the company going forward.  Aside from monetary penalties in the form of forfeiture, the remedial framework requires the migration of any component of Ripple’s business that is engaged in the exchange of virtual currency into an entity registered with FinCEN.  In addition, the agreement calls for continued enhancements to the company’s anti-money laundering (AML) controls and training program.  Further, the remedial framework calls for external audits through the year 2020, enhancements to the ripple protocol, increased transaction monitoring and an extensive review of historical activity.
“By these agreements, we demonstrate again that we will remain vigilant to ensure the security of and prevent the misuse of the financial markets,” said U.S. Attorney Haag.  “Ripple Labs Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary both have acknowledged that digital currency providers have an obligation not only to refrain from illegal activity, but also to ensure they are not profiting by creating products that allow would-be criminals to avoid detection.  We hope that this sets an industry standard in the important new space of digital currency.”
The agreement is the culmination of a criminal investigation conducted by U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation Division.  FinCEN joined the investigation with a parallel civil enforcement action.  In that action, Ripple Labs and XRP II have agreed to pay a $700,000 civil penalty, $450,000 of which will be designated a forfeiture to settle issues raised in the U.S. Attorney’s investigation. 
“Virtual currency exchangers must bring products to market that comply with our anti-money laundering laws,” said Director Calvery for FinCEN.  “Innovation is laudable but only as long as it does not unreasonably expose our financial system to tech-smart criminals eager to abuse the latest and most complex products.”
“Federal laws that regulate the reporting of financial transactions are in place to detect and stop illegal activities, including those in the virtual currency arena,” said Chief Weber of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division.  “Unregulated, virtual currency opens the door for criminals to anonymously conduct illegal activities online, eroding our financial systems and creating a Wild West environment where following the law is a choice rather than a requirement.” 
Ripple described itself as an exchanger of virtual currency in a December 2013 filing made in San Francisco, California, federal court in an unrelated case.  As an exchanger, Ripple was required to register with FinCEN and to comply with applicable federal laws and regulations.  Yet Ripple sold XRP even though it had not registered with FinCEN, effectuating sales of over approximately $1.3 million in April 2013 alone.  Ripple also failed to establish and maintain an appropriate AML program and failed to have policies, procedures and internal controls to ensure compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws.  In July 2013, Ripple incorporated a subsidiary, now known as XRP II, that replaced Ripple as the seller of XRP.  Although XRP II registered with FinCEN, it failed to have an effective AML program or to file appropriate suspicious activity reports.  In late 2013, for example, it negotiated a $250,000 transaction with an individual who had prior felony convictions for dealing in explosive devices and had been sentenced to prison, failing to follow its own internal “know your customer” requirements.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kathryn R. Haun and Arvon J. Perteet handled the matter on behalf of the U.S. Attorney’s Office with the assistance of Daniel Charlier-Smith and Leslie Cook.  The settlement agreement with Ripple Labs was the result of a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and IRS Criminal Investigation, working in tandem with FinCEN.

History[edit]
Ryan Fugger conceived Ripple in 2004 after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver. The intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger later built the first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com. Concurrently, in May 2011, Jed McCaleb began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by Bitcoin. In August 2012, Jed McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and they approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin.[3]
OpenCoin began development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. On 11 April 2013, OpenCoin announced it had closed an angel round of funding with several venture capital firms. That same month, OpenCoin acquired SimpleHoney to help it popularize virtual currencies and make them easier for average users.[4] On 14 May 2013, OpenCoin announced that it had closed a second round of angel funding.[5] In July 2013, Jed McCaleb separated from active employment with Ripple.[6]
On 26 September 2013, OpenCoin officially changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc.[1] Their CTO, Stefan Thomas, further announced that the source code for the peer-to-peer node behind the Ripple payment network was officially open source. Parts of Ripple, particularly a JavaScript-based web client, had been open source months before, but the release of the peer-to-peer "full node" Rippled meant that the community now had the required tools needed to maintain the Ripple network on its own.[7]
On 5 May 2015, Ripple received a US$700,000 (equivalent to $707,272 in 2016) civil money penalty from U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).[8]
On 6 October 2015, the company was rebranded from Ripple Labs to Ripple.[9]
On June 13, 2016, Ripple obtained a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the fourth company with a BitLicense.[10]
Business model[edit]
Ripple is a privately funded company. It has closed five rounds of funding, which included two rounds of angel funding, one round of seed funding, one Series A round and one Series B round.[4][11][12][13][14][2]

Revenue[edit]
Ripple's revenue sources include professional services provided to financial network operators being integrated with Ripple, software built to integrate legacy financial systems with Ripple and the native currency (XRP). Ripple is also backed by several established investors that provide an additional layer of financial stability.[15]
Programs and projects[edit]
Charitable contributions[edit]
Of the XRP80 billion that Ripple Labs was gifted, Ripple follows a distribution strategy that encompasses payments to business partners such as gateways, market makers and charitable organizations.[16]
Ripple Labs began working with the World Community Grid in November 2013. The World Community Grid pools surplus processing power from volunteers’ computers and electronic devices to support humanitarian causes such as fighting AIDS, improving solar energy and defeating cancer. Individuals who join the Ripple Labs team and donate their spare processing power are rewarded with XRP. As of 18 March 2014, Ripple Labs has given away XRP134,528,800 through the World Community Grid at a rate of XRP1,250,000 per day.[17][18][19]
Software development[edit]
Ripple Labs launched a developer portal designed to bring together tools and resources for the developer community. These include an API for its payment network, based on the popular REST API standard. The firm also developed a bounty program for third-party developers, to encourage them to create services for its combined protocol and payment network.The first one was claimed by developer Mathijs Koenraadt who developed a Ripple extension to e-commerce platform Magento. The extension enables Magento to read the Ripple public ledger and create an invoice. European luxury jewelry outlet Rita Zachari has adopted it, and is one of the first merchants to offer a Ripple Wallet payment option at checkout.[20]
Ripple Labs has been involved in several development projects related to the protocol, releasing for example an iOS client app for the iPhone that allows iPhone users to send and receive any currency via their phone.[20][21][22] This Ripple Client app no longer exists.[23]
On 2 July 2013, Ripple Labs announced its linking of the Bitcoin and Ripple protocols via the Bitcoin bridge. The Bitcoin Bridge allows Ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a Bitcoin address.[24][25]
Partnerships and initiatives[edit]
In March 2014, CrossCoin Ventures launched an accelerator which funds companies that work to advance the Ripple ecosystem. The firm funds accepted startups with up to US$50,000 (equivalent to $50,583 in 2016) in XRP, Ripple's native currency, in exchange for a 3% to 6% stake in diluted common stock. Mentorship and support is provided by CrossCoin and Ripple Labs, Inc.[26]
Ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as ZipZap,[27] with the relationship called a threat to Western Union in the press.[28]
In cooperation with other industry leaders, Ripple Labs became a co-founding member of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA) in July 2013. DATA provides best practices and technical standards, including anti-money laundering compliance guidance for companies that work with digital currency and other emerging payments systems. The committee works as a liaison among public officials, businesses and consumers and create common rules to protect consumers. The initiative attempts to create a cohesive voice of Bitcoin community members when interacting with regulators.[29][30]
Awards and recognitions[edit]
For its creation and development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment/exchange network, the magazine MIT Technology Review recognized Ripple Labs as one of 2014's 50 Smartest Companies in its February 2014 issue. The criteria for the recognition revolved around "whether a company had made strides in the past year that will define its field."[31]
On 9 February 2014, Ripple Labs was named as a finalist for a 2014 PYMNTS Innovator Award in two separate categories: Best New Technology as well as Most Disruptive Company. The recognition pertains to Ripple Labs work in creating Ripple, an open-source, distributed payment protocol powering a new global value web.[32]
On 12 January 2016, Ripple was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 8 in the list of 100 Most Influential Blockchain Organisations.[33][34]
Other Awards:

February 2015 - Fast Company. The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies Of 2015 In Money.[35]

February 2015 - American Banker. 20 Fintech Companies to Watch.[36]

August 2015 - Ripple Labs Awarded as Technology Pioneer by World Economic Forum.[37]

December 2015 - Forbes. Fintech 50.[38]

December 2015 - H2 Ventures, KPMG. Fintech 100.[39]

March 2016 - PYMNTS Innovation Project 2016. Best B2B Innovation Award.[40]

June 2016 - Fortune. 5 Hottest Companies in Fintech.[41]

Fincen fines Ripple for bank secrecy act violations[edit]
On May 5, 2015, FinCEN fined Ripple Labs and XRP II US$700,000 for violation of the Bank Secrecy Act,[42] based on the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's anti-money laundering (AML) additions to the act in 2013.[43] Ripple Labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance, which included an agreement to only transact XRP and "Ripple Trade" activity through registered money services businesses (MSB), among other agreements such as enhancing the Ripple Protocol.[42] The enhancement won't change the protocol itself, but will instead add AML transaction monitoring to the network and improve transaction analysis.[43]

The World Community Grid pools surplus processing power from volunteers’ computers and electronic devices to support humanitarian causes such as fighting AIDS, improving solar energy and defeating cancer. Individuals who join the Ripple Labs team and donate their spare processing power are rewarded with XRP. As of 18 March 2014, Ripple Labs has given away XRP134,528,800 through the World Community Grid at a rate of XRP1,250,000 per day.[17][18][19]
Software development[edit]
Ripple Labs launched a developer portal designed to bring together tools and resources for the developer community. These include an API for its payment network, based on the popular REST API standard. The firm also developed a bounty program for third-party developers, to encourage them to create services for its combined protocol and payment network.The first one was claimed by developer Mathijs Koenraadt who developed a Ripple extension to e-commerce platform Magento. The extension enables Magento to read the Ripple public ledger and create an invoice. European luxury jewelry outlet Rita Zachari has adopted it, and is one of the first merchants to offer a Ripple Wallet payment option at checkout.[20]
Ripple Labs has been involved in several development projects related to the protocol, releasing for example an iOS client app for the iPhone that allows iPhone users to send and receive any currency via their phone.[20][21][22] This Ripple Client app no longer exists.[23]
On 2 July 2013, Ripple Labs announced its linking of the Bitcoin and Ripple protocols via the Bitcoin bridge. The Bitcoin Bridge allows Ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a Bitcoin address.[24][25]
Partnerships and initiatives[edit]
In March 2014, CrossCoin Ventures launched an accelerator which funds companies that work to advance the Ripple ecosystem. The firm funds accepted startups with up to US$50,000 (equivalent to $50,583 in 2016) in XRP, Ripple's native currency, in exchange for a 3% to 6% stake in diluted common stock. Mentorship and support is provided by CrossCoin and Ripple Labs, Inc.[26]
Ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as ZipZap,[27] with the relationship called a threat to Western Union in the press.[28]
In cooperation with other industry leaders, Ripple Labs became a co-founding member of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA) in July 2013. DATA provides best practices and technical standards, including anti-money laundering compliance guidance for companies that work with digital currency and other emerging payments systems. The committee works as a liaison among public officials, businesses and consumers and create common rules to protect consumers. The initiative attempts to create a cohesive voice of Bitcoin community members when interacting with regulators.[29][30]
Awards and recognitions[edit]
For its creation and development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment/exchange network, the magazine MIT Technology Review recognized Ripple Labs as one of 2014's 50 Smartest Companies in its February 2014 issue. The criteria for the recognition revolved around "whether a company had made strides in the past year that will define its field."[31]
On 9 February 2014, Ripple Labs was named as a finalist for a 2014 PYMNTS Innovator Award in two separate categories: Best New Technology as well as Most Disruptive Company. The recognition pertains to Ripple Labs work in creating Ripple, an open-source, distributed payment protocol powering a new global value web.[32]
On 12 January 2016, Ripple was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 8 in the list of 100 Most Influential Blockchain Organisations.[33][34]
Other Awards:

February 2015 - Fast Company. The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies Of 2015 In Money.[35]

February 2015 - American Banker. 20 Fintech Companies to Watch.[36]

August 2015 - Ripple Labs Awarded as Technology Pioneer by World Economic Forum.[37]

Fincen fines Ripple for bank secrecy act violations[edit]
On May 5, 2015, FinCEN fined Ripple Labs and XRP II US$700,000 for violation of the Bank Secrecy Act,[42] based on the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's anti-money laundering (AML) additions to the act in 2013.[43] Ripple Labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance, which included an agreement to only transact XRP and "Ripple Trade" activity through registered money services businesses (MSB), among other agreements such as enhancing the Ripple Protocol.[42] The enhancement won't change the protocol itself, but will instead add AML transaction monitoring to the network and improve transaction analysis.[43]

History[edit]
Ryan Fugger conceived Ripple in 2004 after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver. The intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger later built the first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com. Concurrently, in May 2011, Jed McCaleb began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by Bitcoin. In August 2012, Jed McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and they approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin.[3]
OpenCoin began development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. On 11 April 2013, OpenCoin announced it had closed an angel round of funding with several venture capital firms. That same month, OpenCoin acquired SimpleHoney to help it popularize virtual currencies and make them easier for average users.[4] On 14 May 2013, OpenCoin announced that it had closed a second round of angel funding.[5] In July 2013, Jed McCaleb separated from active employment with Ripple.[6]
On 26 September 2013, OpenCoin officially changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc.[1] Their CTO, Stefan Thomas, further announced that the source code for the peer-to-peer node behind the Ripple payment network was officially open source. Parts of Ripple, particularly a JavaScript-based web client, had been open source months before, but the release of the peer-to-peer "full node" Rippled meant that the community now had the required tools needed to maintain the Ripple network on its own.[7]
On 5 May 2015, Ripple received a US$700,000 (equivalent to $707,272 in 2016) civil money penalty from U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).[8]
On 6 October 2015, the company was rebranded from Ripple Labs to Ripple.[9]
On June 13, 2016, Ripple obtained a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the fourth company with a BitLicense.[10]
Business model[edit]
Ripple is a privately funded company. It has closed five rounds of funding, which included two rounds of angel funding, one round of seed funding, one Series A round and one Series B round.[4][11][12][13][14][2]

Revenue[edit]
Ripple's revenue sources include professional services provided to financial network operators being integrated with Ripple, software built to integrate legacy financial systems with Ripple and the native currency (XRP). Ripple is also backed by several established investors that provide an additional layer of financial stability.[15]
Programs and projects[edit]
Charitable contributions[edit]
Of the XRP80 billion that Ripple Labs was gifted, Ripple follows a distribution strategy that encompasses payments to business partners such as gateways, market makers and charitable organizations.[16]
Ripple Labs began working with the World Community Grid in November 2013. The World Community Grid pools surplus processing power from volunteers’ computers and electronic devices to support humanitarian causes such as fighting AIDS, improving solar energy and defeating cancer. Individuals who join the Ripple Labs team and donate their spare processing power are rewarded with XRP. As of 18 March 2014, Ripple Labs has given away XRP134,528,800 through the World Community Grid at a rate of XRP1,250,000 per day.[17][18][19]
Software development[edit]
Ripple Labs launched a developer portal designed to bring together tools and resources for the developer community. These include an API for its payment network, based on the popular REST API standard. The firm also developed a bounty program for third-party developers, to encourage them to create services for its combined protocol and payment network.The first one was claimed by developer Mathijs Koenraadt who developed a Ripple extension to e-commerce platform Magento. The extension enables Magento to read the Ripple public ledger and create an invoice. European luxury jewelry outlet Rita Zachari has adopted it, and is one of the first merchants to offer a Ripple Wallet payment option at checkout.[20]
Ripple Labs has been involved in several development projects related to the protocol, releasing for example an iOS client app for the iPhone that allows iPhone users to send and receive any currency via their phone.[20][21][22] This Ripple Client app no longer exists.[23]
On 2 July 2013, Ripple Labs announced its linking of the Bitcoin and Ripple protocols via the Bitcoin bridge. The Bitcoin Bridge allows Ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a Bitcoin address.[24][25]
Partnerships and initiatives[edit]
In March 2014, CrossCoin Ventures launched an accelerator which funds companies that work to advance the Ripple ecosystem. The firm funds accepted startups with up to US$50,000 (equivalent to $50,583 in 2016) in XRP, Ripple's native currency, in exchange for a 3% to 6% stake in diluted common stock. Mentorship and support is provided by CrossCoin and Ripple Labs, Inc.[26]
Ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as ZipZap,[27] with the relationship called a threat to Western Union in the press.[28]
In cooperation with other industry leaders, Ripple Labs became a co-founding member of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA) in July 2013. DATA provides best practices and technical standards, including anti-money laundering compliance guidance for companies that work with digital currency and other emerging payments systems. The committee works as a liaison among public officials, businesses and consumers and create common rules to protect consumers. The initiative attempts to create a cohesive voice of Bitcoin community members when interacting with regulators.[29][30]

FinCEN Fines Ripple Labs Inc. in First Civil Enforcement Action Against a Virtual Currency Exchanger

Immediate Release
May 05, 2015




WASHINGTON, DC – The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), working in coordination with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California (USAO-NDCA), assessed a $700,000 civil money penalty today against Ripple Labs Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, XRP II, LLC (formerly known as XRP Fund II, LLC). Ripple Labs willfully violated several requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by acting as a money services business (MSB) and selling its virtual currency, known as XRP, without registering with FinCEN, and by failing to implement and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program designed to protect its products from use by money launderers or terrorist financiers. XRP II later assumed Ripple Labs' functions of selling virtual currency and acting as an MSB; however, like its parent company, XRP II willfully violated the BSA by failing to implement an effective AML program, and by failing to report suspicious activity related to several financial transactions.
“Virtual currency exchangers must bring products to market that comply with our anti-money laundering laws,”said FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery. “Innovation is laudable but only as long as it does not unreasonably expose our financial system to tech-smart criminals eager to abuse the latest and most complex products.”
FinCEN's assessment is concurrent with the USAO-NDCA's announcement of a settlement agreement with Ripple Labs and XRP II. In that settlement, the companies resolved possible criminal charges and forfeited $450,000. The $450,000 forfeiture in that action will be credited to partially satisfy FinCEN's $700,000 civil money penalty. A Statement of Facts and Violations, describing the underlying activity and details of the BSA violations, is incorporated into FinCEN's assessment as well as the USAO-NDCA's settlement.
Both actions were accompanied by an agreement by Ripple and XRP II to engage in remedial steps to ensure future compliance with AML/CFT obligations, as well as enhanced remedial measures. Among these steps are agreements to only transact XRP and “Ripple Trade” activity through a registered MSB: to implement and maintain an effective AML program: to comply with the Funds Transfer and Funds Travel Rules: to conduct a three-year “look-back” to require suspicious activity reporting for prior suspicious transactions and a requirement for the companies to retain external independent auditors to review their compliance with the BSA every two years up to and including 2020. Pursuant to the agreement, Ripple Labs will also undertake certain enhancements to the Ripple Protocol to appropriately monitor all future transactions.
“By these agreements, we demonstrate again that we will remain vigilant to ensure the security of, and prevent the misuse of, the financial markets,” said U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag. “Ripple Labs Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary both have acknowledged that digital currency providers have an obligation not only to refrain from illegal activity, but also to ensure they are not profiting by creating products that allow would–be criminals to avoid detection. We hope that this sets an industry standard in the important new space of digital currency.”
“Federal laws that regulate the reporting of financial transactions are in place to detect and stop illegal activities, including those in the virtual currency arena,” said Richard Weber, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation. “Unregulated, virtual currency opens the door for criminals to anonymously conduct illegal activities online, eroding our financial systems and creating a Wild West environment where following the law is a choice rather than a requirement.”
Ripple Labs Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, CA, facilitated transfers of virtual currency and provided virtual currency exchange transaction services. XRP II, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ripple Labs that was incorporated as XRP Fund II, LLC in South Carolina on July 1, 2013; the company changed its name to XRP II in July 2014. As of 2015, Ripple is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin. On March 18, 2013, FinCEN released guidance clarifying the applicability of regulations implementing the BSA, and the requirement for certain participants in the virtual currency arena–namely, virtual currency exchangers and administrators–to register as MSBs with FinCEN pursuant to federal law.
Director Shasky Calvery expressed her appreciation to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California and to the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation Division for their contributions to the investigation and strong partnership with FinCEN.
FinCEN seeks to protect the U.S. financial system from being exploited by illicit activity. Its efforts are focused on compromised financial institutions and their employees; significant fraud; third-party money launderers; transnational organized crime and security threats; and cyber threats. FinCEN has a broad array of enforcement authorities to target both domestic and foreign actions affecting the U.S. financial system.
FinCEN's mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit use and combat money laundering and promote national security through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence and strategic use of financial authorities.

Ripple Announces Management Changes
Nov 1 16
Ripple announced Chris Larsen has decided to transition from his operational role as chief executive officer of Ripple to executive chairman of Ripple’s board of directors. He has named Brad Garlinghouse his successor as CEO of Ripple, effective January 1, 2017. As executive chairman of Ripple, Larsen will be responsible for leading the board of directors, strategic oversight of the business and identifying strategic partnership opportunities. He’ll remain the controlling shareholder of the company. Garlinghouse will take the helm as CEO after more than a year and a half as Ripple’s president and chief operating officer. As president and chief operating officer, Brad built out Ripple’s organization to support a global enterprise software business, established operational excellence, and led more than 3.5 times growth in customer adoption. Brad was previously CEO of Hightail, where he doubled the company’s revenue in a highly competitive market. In 2006, Larsen co-founded Prosper Marketplace, the first peer-to-peer lending marketplace in the U.S. He co-founded Ripple in 2012 and has served as CEO and chairman of the board since.


Ripple Labs Seeks Acquisitions
Sep 15 16
Ripple Labs Inc. is looking for acquisition opportunities. Ripple’s fresh funds have also given the company ammunition for acquisitions. Chris Larsen, Chief Executive of Ripple said, "We do think there will be opportunities especially with the change of tone of what's getting funded and not. There will be really good companies that can't get to the next round and might be better for them to be bought out. We will look at opportunities about what we can integrate with our business."


ATB Financial Collaborates with SAP SE, Ripple Labs Inc. and ReiseBank AG to Send Real International Blockchain Payment from Canada to Germany
Jul 18 16
ATB Financial has collaborated with SAP SE, Ripple Labs Inc. and ReiseBank AG to send the first real international blockchain payment from Canada to Germany. ATB successfully transferred CAD 1,000 (EUR 667) to ReiseBank using a network built on SAP technology and Ripple's pioneering network of enterprise blockchain solutions. The payment, which would typically have taken between two to six business days to process because of requirements such as settling with the counterparty bank and reconciling accounts, was completed in around 20 seconds. The blockchain, originally created as the foundation for trading the digital currency bitcoin, is a distributed ledger that allows a network of computers to settle transactions almost instantly and with inherent security. Working with a team at ATB Financial, SAP and Ripple designed and built a proof-of-concept prototype based on the technology in nine working days. It demonstrated how banks can improve the efficiency of cross-border payments to enhance their global networks and be competitive on the world stage. The technology prototype connects SAP HANA Cloud Platform, the open platform as a service from SAP, and the SAP Payment Engine application, which centralizes payment processing in one solution, with Ripple's network. For the demonstration, SAP provided a mobile user interface through which the payment was executed.

Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), currency exchange and remittance network by Ripple. Also called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol,[3] it is built upon a distributed open source Internet protocol, consensus ledger and native currency called XRP (ripples). Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable "secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks." It supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes.[4][5] At its core, Ripple is based around a shared, public database or ledger,[6] which uses a consensus process that allows for payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.[7]
In 2014, Ripple defended the security of its consensus algorithm against rival Stellar Network.[8][9] Currently, Ripple is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization,[10][11] after bitcoin and Ethereum.[12][13][14][15]
Used by companies such as UniCredit, UBS and Santander, the Ripple protocol has been increasingly adopted by banks and payment networks as settlement infrastructure technology,[16] with American Banker explaining that "from banks' perspective, distributed ledgers like the Ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like bitcoin," including price and security.[17]

History[edit]
Early development (2004–12)[edit]
The predecessor to the Ripple payment protocol, Ripplepay, was first developed in 2004 by Ryan Fugger,[18][19] a web developer in Vancouver, British Columbia.[20] Fugger conceived of the idea after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver, and his intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively allow individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger's first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com,[21] debuted in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network.[20][22]
This led to the conception of a new system by Jed McCaleb of eDonkey network,[23] which was designed and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz.[24] In May 2011, they began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by bitcoin, which relies on blockchain ledgers.[21] This new version of the Ripple system[20] was therefore designed to eliminate bitcoin's reliance on centralized exchanges, use less electricity than bitcoin, and perform transactions much more quickly than bitcoin.[20] Chris Larsen,[21] who had previously founded the lending services companies E-Loan and Prosper, joined the team in August 2012,[23] and together McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins.[21] In September 2012 the team co-founded the corporation OpenCoin,[21] or OpenCoin Inc.[23][25]
OpenCoin and Ripple Labs (2012–13)[edit]
Main article: Ripple (company)
OpenCoin began developing a new payment protocol called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) based on Ryan Fugger's concepts.[21] The Ripple protocol enables the instant and direct transfer of money between two parties.[26] As such the protocol can circumnavigate the fees and wait times of the traditional correspondent banking system,[26][27] and any type of currency can be exchanged including USD, euros, RMB, yen, gold, airline miles, and rupees.[28] To maintain security OpenCoin programmed Ripple to rely on a common ledger that is "managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records." Servers could belong to anyone, including banks or market makers.[26] The company also created its own form of digital currency dubbed XRP in a manner similar to bitcoin, using the currency to allow financial insititutions to transfer money with negligible fees and wait-time.[29]
Among OpenCoin's early investors were[30] Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures.[26] On July 1, 2013, XRP Fund II, LLC (now called simply XRP II)[31] was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of OpenCoin, and headquartered in South Carolina.[31] The following day, Ripple announced its linking of the bitcoin and Ripple protocols via the Bitcoin Bridge. The bitcoin Bridge allows Ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a bitcoin address.[32][33] Ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as ZipZap.[34] On September 26, 2013, OpenCoin Inc. changed its name to Ripple Labs Inc.,[25] with Chris Larsen remaining CEO.[35] On the same day the Ripple reference server and client became free software, released as open source under the terms of the ISC license.[2] Ripple Labs continued as the primary contributors of code to the consensus verification system behind Ripple, which can "integrate with banks’ existing networks."[36] In October 2013, Ripple partnered further with ZipZap, with the relationship called a threat to Western Union in the press.[37]
Focus on banking market (2014–17)[edit]
By 2014, Ripple Labs was involved in several development projects related to the protocol, releasing for example an iOS client app for the iPhone that allows iPhone users to send and receive any currency via their phone.[38][39][40] This Ripple Client app no longer exists.[41] In July 2014, Ripple Labs proposed Codius, a project to develop a new smart contract system that is "programming language agnostic."[42]


"...we think that the bigger opportunity is not just to create another digital currency – there are plenty of those - but rather to use that technology as a way of building a settlement system with no central operator."


— Ripple CEO Chris Larsen in December 2014[28]


Since 2013, the protocol has been adopted by an increasing number of financial institutions to "[offer] an alternative remittance option" to consumers.[43] Ripple allows for cross-border payments for retail customers, corporations, and other banks, and Larsen was quoted stating that "Ripple simplifies the [exchange] process by creating point-to-point and transparent transfers in which banks do not have to pay corresponding bank fees."[28] The first bank to use Ripple was Fidor Bank in Munich, which announced the partnership in early 2014. Fidor is an online-only bank based in Germany.[44] That September the New Jersey-based Cross River Bank and Kansas-based CBW Bank announced they would be using the Ripple protocol.[3] By December Ripple Labs began working with global payments service Earthport, combining Ripple's software with Earthport's payment services system. Earthport's clients include banks such as Bank of America and HSBC, and it operates in 65 countries. The partnership marked the first network usage of the Ripple protocol.[45] In December 2014 alone, the XRP price value rose over 200%, helping Ripple surpass litecoin to become the second biggest crypto-currency, and setting Ripple's market capitalization at close to half a billion.[46]
In February 2015, Fidor Bank announced they would be using the Ripple protocol to implement a new real-time international money transfer network,[47] and in late April 2015, it was announced that Western Union was planning to "experiment" with Ripple.[37] In late May 2015, Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced it would be experimenting with Ripple[48] in relation to intrabank transfers.[49] Since 2012, representatives of Ripple Labs have professed support for government regulation of the crypto-currency market, claiming that regulations help businesses grow.[50] On May 5, 2015, FinCEN fined Ripple Labs and XRP II US$700,000 for violation of the Bank Secrecy Act,[31] based on the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's additions to the act in 2013.[51] Ripple Labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance, which included an agreement to only transact XRP and "Ripple Trade" activity through registered money services businesses (MSB), among other agreements such as enhancing the Ripple Protocol.[31] The enhancement won't change the protocol itself, but will instead add AML transaction monitoring to the network and improve transaction analysis.[51] As of 2017, the current release of the server (known as rippled) is version 0.40.0.[1]
The year 2015 and 2016 marked the expansion of Ripple (company) with the opening of an office in Sydney, Australia in April 2015[52] and the opening of European offices in London, United Kingdom in March 2016[53] then in Luxembourg in June 2016.[54] Many companies have subsequently announced experimenting and integrations with Ripple.[55]

On June 13, 2016, Ripple obtained a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the fourth company with a BitLicense.[76]
On August 19, 2016, SBI Ripple Asia announced the creation of a Japanese consortium of banks in a new network that will use Ripple’s technology for payments and settlement.[77] The consortium was officially launched on October 25, 2016 with 42 member banks.[78] As of July 2017, 61 Japanese banks had joined, representing over 80% of total banking assets in Japan.[79]
On September 23, 2016, Ripple announced the creation of the first interbank group for global payments based on distributed financial technology. As of April 2017, members of the network known as the Global Payments Steering Group (GPSG) are Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Royal Bank of Canada, Santander, Standard Chartered, UniCredit and Westpac Banking Corporation. The group will "oversee the creation and maintenance of Ripple payment transaction rules, formalized standards for activity using Ripple, and other actions to support the implementation of Ripple payment capabilities."[80][81]
Concept[edit]


"...as an open protocol, Ripple enables a peer-to-peer server architecture to facilitate the movement of value among financial institutions. This allows financial services companies to make payments directly to each other, whether across different networks, geographic borders or currencies."


— Consultative Group to Assist the Poor in 2015[82]


Ripple's website describes the opensource protocol as "basic infrastructure technology for interbank transactions – a neutral utility for financial institutions and systems." The protocol allows banks and non-bank financial services companies to incorporate the Ripple protocol into their own systems, and therefore allow their customers to use the service.[83] Currently, Ripple requires two parties for a transaction to occur: first, a regulated financial institution "holds funds and issues balances on behalf of customers." Second, "market makers" such as hedge funds or currency trading desks provide liquidity in the currency they want to trade in.[84] At its core, Ripple is based around a shared, public database or ledger that has its contents decided on by consensus.[6] In addition to balances, the ledger holds information about offers to buy or sell currencies and assets, creating the first distributed exchange.[83] The consensus process allows for payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.[7] According to the CGAP in 2015, "Ripple does for payments what SMTP did for email, which is enable the systems of different financial institutions to communicate directly."[82]
In Ripple, users make payments between each other by using cryptographically signed transactions denominated in either fiat currencies or Ripple's internal currency (XRP). For XRP-denominated transactions Ripple can make use of its internal ledger, while for payments denominated in other assets, the Ripple ledger only records the amounts owed, with assets represented as debt obligations.[18] As originally Ripple only kept records in its ledger and has no real-world enforcement power, trust was required.[18][clarification needed] However, Ripple is now integrated with various user verification protocols and bank services.[85] Users have to specify which other users they trust and to what amount.[18] When a non-XRP payment is made between two users that trust each other, the balance of the mutual credit line is adjusted, subject to limits set by each user. In order to send assets between users that have not directly established a trust relationship, the system tries to find a path between the two users such that each link of the path is between two users that do have a trust relationship. All balances along the path are then adjusted simultaneously and atomically.[18] This mechanism of making payments through a network of trusted associates is named 'rippling'. It has similarities to the age-old hawala system.[86]
Design features[edit]
Gateways[edit]
A gateway is any person or organization that enables users to put money into and take money out of Ripple's liquidity pool.[2] A gateway accepts currency deposits from users and issues balances into Ripple's distributed ledger. Furthermore, gateways redeem ledger balances against the deposits they hold when currency is withdrawn. In practice, gateways are similar to banks, yet they share one global ledger known as the Ripple protocol. Depending on the type and degree of interaction a user has with a gateway, the gateway may have anti-money laundering (AML) or know your customer (KYC) policies requiring verification of identification, address, nationality, etc. to prevent criminal activity.[5] Popular gateways as of 2017 included Bitstamp, Gatehub, Ripple Fox, Tokyo JPY, Mr. Ripple, RippleChina and The Rock Trading.[87]
Trustlines and rippling[edit]
Users must ‘extend trust’ to the Ripple gateway that holds their deposit. This manual creation of a trustline indicates to the Ripple network that the user is comfortable with the gateway’s counterparty risk. Furthermore, the user must put a quantitative limit on this trust and create a similar limit for each currency on deposit at that gateway. For example, if a user deposits US$50 and BTC2.00 at The Rock Trading, the user will have to grant trust of at least that much in both currencies to the gateway for the monies to be available in the Ripple network.[88] When a user has allowed multiple gateways in the same currency, there is an advanced option to allow "rippling," which subjects the user’s balance of that currency to switch (or ripple) between gateways. Though their total balance doesn't alter, users earn a small transit fee for providing inter-gateway liquidity.[89]
Creditworthiness[edit]
Similar to reasons during the Free Banking Era in the United States, the value of a currency can vary significantly depending on a gateway's creditworthiness. A non-profit trade association, the International Ripple Business Association (IRBA), provides unified procedures and disclosure standards for gateways.[90][91][92] As of June 2015[update], fifteen businesses had met or exceeded the IRBA standards.[90][91]
Consensus ledger[edit]
Ripple relies on a common shared ledger, which is a distributed database storing information about all Ripple accounts. The network is "managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records." Servers could belong to anyone, including banks or market makers.[26] Though the Ripple protocol is freeware,[2] Ripple Labs continues to develop and promote the Ripple protocol, which confirms financial transactions via a network of distributed servers. Ripple Labs is currently assisting banks in integrating with the Ripple network.[36] A new ledger is created every few seconds,[93] and the last closed ledger is a perfect record of all Ripple accounts as determined by the network of servers. A transaction is any proposed change to the ledger and can be introduced by any server to the network. The servers attempt to come to consensus about a set of transactions to apply to the ledger, creating a new ‘last closed ledger’.[93]
The consensus process is distributed,[94] and the goal of consensus is for each server to apply the same set of transactions to the current ledger.[93] Servers continually receive transactions from other servers on the network,[93] and the server determines which transactions to apply based on if a transaction came from a specified node in the ‘unique node list’ or UNL.[not in citation given][7] Transactions that are agreed upon by a "supermajority" of peers are considered validated.[93] If the supermajority isn't in consensus, "this implies that transaction volume was too high or network latency too great for the consensus process to produce consistent proposals," then the consensus process is again attempted by the nodes. Each round of consensus reduces disagreement, until the supermajority is reached.[93] The intended outcome of this process is that disputed transactions are discarded from proposals while widely accepted transactions are included.[93] While users may assemble their own UNL nodes and have full control over which nodes they trust, Ripple Labs acknowledges that most people will use the default UNL supplied by their client.[not in citation given][7]
Ledger security[edit]
In early 2014,[95] a rival company called the Stellar Foundation[96] experienced a network crash.[8] The company brought in David Mazieres, Stellar's chief scientist and head of Stanford University's secure computing group, to conduct a review of the Stellar consensus system, which was similar to Ripple's. Mazieres declared the Stellar system unlikely to be safe when operating with "more than one validating node,"[8] arguing that when consensus is not reached, a ledger fork occurs with parts of the network disagreeing over accepted transactions.[9] The Stellar Foundation afterwards claimed that there was an "innate weaknesses" in the consensus process,[8] a claim which according to Finance Magnates, "Ripple vehemently denied."[95] Ripple Labs chief cryptographer David Schwartz disputed Mazieres' findings and declared that Stellar had incorrectly implemented the consensus system, as "the protocol provides safety and fault tolerance assuming the validators are configured correctly."[9] The company further wrote that after examining Stellar's information, they had concluded "that there is no threat to the continued operation of the Ripple network."[97]
Use as a payment/forex system[edit]
Ripple allows users or businesses to conduct cross-currency transactions[98] in 3 to 5 seconds.[83] All accounts and transactions are cryptographically secure and algorithmically verified. Payments can only be authorized by the account holder and all payments are processed automatically without any third parties or intermediaries.[98] Ripple validates accounts and balances instantly for payment transmission and delivers payment notification with very little latency (within a few seconds).[99] Payments are irreversible, and there are no chargebacks.[100] XRP cannot be frozen or seized.[101] While as of 2014 anyone could open an account on Ripple,[101] by 2015 identity verification procedures had been implemented.[85] Ripple's Path-finding Algorithm searches for the fastest, cheapest path between two currencies.[102] In the case of a user who wants to send a payment from USD to EUR, this could be a "one-hop" path directly from USD to EUR, or it could be a multi-hop path, perhaps from USD to CAD to XRP to EUR.[103] Path finding is designed to seek out the cheapest conversion cost for the user. As of May 14, 2014[update], Ripple's gateways allow deposits in a limited number of fiat currencies (USD, EUR, MXN, NZD, GBP, NOK, JPY, CAD, CHF, CNY, AUD), a handful of crypto currencies (BTC, XRP, LTC, NMC, NXT, PPC, XVN, SLL) and a few commodities (gold, silver, platinum).[104][105][106]
The Bitcoin Bridge[edit]
The bitcoin bridge is a link between the Ripple and bitcoin ecosystems. The bridge makes it possible to pay any bitcoin user straight from a Ripple account without ever needing to hold any of the digital currency. Additionally, any merchant accepting bitcoins has the potential to accept any currency in the world. For example, a Ripple user may prefer to keep money in USD and not own bitcoins. A merchant, however, may desire payment in bitcoin. The bitcoin bridge allows any Ripple user to send bitcoins without having to use a central exchange such as BTC-e to acquire them.[33][107] Bitstamp acts as a gateway for the Ripple payment protocol, among other exchanges.
Privacy[edit]
While transaction information on the ledger is public, payment information is not. It’s thus difficult for anyone to associate transaction information with any specific user or corporation.[108]
Market makers[edit]
Any user on Ripple can act as a market maker by offering an arbitrage service such as providing market liquidity, intra-gateway currency conversion, rippling, etc. Market makers can also be hedge funds or currency trading desks. According to the Ripple website, "by holding balances in multiple currencies and connecting to multiple gateways, market makers facilitate payments between users where no direct trust exists, enabling exchanges across gateways."[109] With a sufficient number of market makers, the path finding algorithm creates a near frictionless market and enables users to seamlessly pay each other via the network in different currencies, without assuming any undesired foreign exchange risk.[110]
Many such services are offered through a traditional platform of offers to buy or sell one currency for another currency. Bids and asks are aggregated into order books, to create a decentralized exchange. Users can transact with market makers to trade or convert currencies.[citation needed] Ripple's path finding algorithm leverages this functionality to allow users to send money in one currency and the recipient to receive it in another currency.[110] For example, a user can pay with USD and the recipient can choose to receive the money in another currency, including bitcoins and XRP.[110]
Open API[edit]
Ripple Labs built the protocol to be friendly to the developer community, and resulting features include an API for its payment network, based on the popular REST API standard. One of the earliest extensions by third-party developers was a Ripple extension to e-commerce platform Magento, which enables Magento to read the Ripple public ledger and create an invoice. There has been a Ripple Wallet payment option developed for retail situations as well.[38]

"XRP exists natively within the Ripple protocol as a counterparty-free currency, as Bitcoin does on the Blockchain. Because XRP is an asset, as opposed to a redeemable balance, it does not require that users trust any specific financial institution to trade or exchange it. All other currencies on Ripple do require some amount of trust, as they each have an issuer, from whom that currency can be redeemed (this includes BTC on the Ripple network)."


— Ripple protocol[111]


XRP is the native currency of the Ripple network that only exists within the Ripple system.[112] XRP are currently divisible to 6 decimal places, and the smallest unit is called a drop with 1 million drops equaling 1 XRP.[112] There were 100 billion XRP created at Ripple's inception, with no more allowed to be created according to the protocol's rules.[113] As such, the system was designed so XRP is a scarce asset with decreasing available supply.[113] Not dependent on any third party for redemption, XRP is the only currency in the Ripple network that does not entail counterparty risk, and it is the only native digital asset. The other currencies in the Ripple network are debt instruments (i.e. liabilities), and exist in the form of balances.[2] Users of the Ripple network are not required to use XRP as a store of value or a medium of exchange. Each Ripple account is required, however, to have a small reserve of 20 XRP[114] (US$6.58 as of May 16, 2017[115]). The purpose for this requirement is discussed in the anti-spam section.
Distribution[edit]
Of the 100 billion created, 20 billion XRP were retained by the creators, who were also the founders of Ripple Labs. The creators gave the remaining 80% of the total to Ripple Labs, with the XRP intended "to incentivize market maker activity to increase XRP liquidity and strengthen the overall health of XRP markets."[113][116] Ripple Labs also had a short-lived 2013 giveaway of under 200 million XRP (0.2% of all XRP) with some of the amount given to charities such as the Computing for Good initiative, which began offering XRP in exchange for time volunteered on research projects.[117] As of March 2015, 67% of Ripple Labs's original 80% was still retained by the company,[113] with Ripple Labs stating that "we will engage in distribution strategies that we expect will result in a stable or strengthening XRP exchange rate against other currencies."[118] In May 2017, to alleviate concerns surrounding XRP supply, Ripple committed to place 55 billion XRP (88% of its XRP holdings) into a cryptographically-secured escrow. The escrow will allow them to sell up to 1 billion monthly and return whatever is unused at the end of each month to the back of the escrow queue in the form of an additional month-long contract, starting the process all over.[119][116] The amount of XRP distributed and their movement can be tracked through the Ripple Charts website.[120]
As a bridge currency[edit]
One of the specific functions of XRP is as a bridge currency,[103] which can be necessary if no direct exchange is available between two currencies at a specific time,[121] for example when transacting between two rarely traded currency pairs.[111] Within the network’s currency exchange, XRP are traded freely against other currencies, and its market price fluctuates against dollars, euros, yen, bitcoin, etc. Ripple's design focus is as a currency exchange and a distributed-RTGS, as opposed to emphasizing XRP as an alternative currency.[111] In April 2015, Ripple Labs announced that a new feature called autobridging had been added to Ripple, with the intent of making it easier for market makers to transact between rarely traded currency pairs. The feature is also intended to expose more of the network to liquidity and better FX rates.[122]
As an anti-spam measure[edit]
When a user conducts a financial transaction in a non-native currency, Ripple charges a transaction fee. The purpose of the fees is to protect against network flooding by making the attacks too expensive for hackers. If Ripple were completely free to access, adversaries could broadcast large amounts of "ledger spam" (i.e. fake accounts) and "transaction spam" (i.e. fake transactions) in an attempt to overload the network. This could cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable and interfere with the network’s ability to quickly settle legitimate transactions. Thus, to engage in trade, each Ripple account is required to have a small reserve of 20 XRP,[114] (US$0.16 as of October 3, 2016[115]), and a transaction fee starting at .00001 XRP (US$.00000008 as of October 3, 2016[115]) must be spent for each trade. This transaction fee is not collected by anyone; the XRP is destroyed and ceases to exist.[123] The transaction fee rises if the user posts trades at an enormous rate (many thousands per minute), and resettles after a period of inactivity.[88]
Reception[edit]
Since its debut the Ripple protocol has received a fair amount of attention in both the financial and mainstream press. Ripple has recently been mentioned in industry articles by The Nielsen Company, the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, NACHA, and KPMG, with many of the articles examining Ripple's effect on internationalizing the banking industry.[124] In April 2015, American Banker asserted that "from banks' perspective, distributed ledgers like the Ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin," including security.[17] Wrote the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, "the adoption of distributed networks, such as Ripple, may help the [banking] industry realize faster processing, as well as greater efficiencies for global payments and correspondent banking."[124] Writing for Esquire about Ripple as a payment network in 2013, Ken Kurson said that "the big financial-service brands ought to feel about Ripple the way the record labels felt about Napster."[125] The New York Times website Dealbook points out in 2014 that “[Ripple] is winning something that has proved elusive for virtual currencies: involvement from more mainstream players in the financial system.”[16] In August 2015, Ripple has been awarded as Technology Pioneer by World Economic Forum.[126]

Comparisons to competition

Though Ripple is third in market capitalization to bitcoin as a digital currency,[10] many members of the press have described Ripple as an up-and-coming rival to bitcoin. In late 2014, Bloomberg called bitcoin a "failing" digital currency, after bitcoin's currency fell 54 percent in value in one year. Ripple was described as a significant competitor, in part because of its real-time international money transfers.[127] Bill Gates supported this outlook and mentioned the Ripple system when asked about bitcoin in 2014, stating "there’s a lot that bitcoin or Ripple and variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically. But bitcoin won’t be the dominant system.”[128] About Ripple's allowance of any electronic value holder, the Vice President of the St. Louis Federal Reserve and professor at Simon Fraser University, David Andolfatto, stated in 2014 that "Ripple is a currency-agnostic protocol. Ripple is the winner. It processes anything."[129] For its creation and development of the Ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment/exchange network, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) recognized Ripple Labs as one of 2014's 50 Smartest Companies in the February 2014 edition of MIT Technology Review.[130]

Reactions to XRP

The reaction to XRP is polarized in the crypto-currency community.[7] Proponents of bitcoin have criticized XRP for being "pre-mined," as XRP is built directly into the Ripple protocol and requires no mining. Also, Ripple Labs' distribution of the original limited amount of XRP currency has met with a fair amount of controversy,[95] and in particular the founders' retainment of 20% is seen as a high percentage. However, Esquire countered in 2013 that "if that is devious, then so is every company that's ever gone public while retaining the great bulk of its shares."[125] Much of the controversy was settled after the announcement that the founders[96] Jed McCaleb[131] and Arthur Britto[96] would be selling their XRP at a mediated rate over several years, "a move that should add stability and restore confidence to the XRP market."[96] CEO Chris Larsen in turn donated 7 billion XRP to the Ripple Foundation for Financial Innovation, with the XRP to be "locked up" and donated over time.[132] In 2016, of the 20% allocated initially to the founders, nearly half had been donated to non-profits and charities.[131][132][133]

Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), currency exchange and remittance network by Ripple. Also called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol,[3] it is built upon a distributed open source Internet protocol, consensus ledger and native currency called XRP (ripples). Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable "secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks." It supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes.[4][5] At its core, Ripple is based around a shared, public database or ledger,[6] which uses a consensus process that allows for payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.[7]
In 2014, Ripple defended the security of its consensus algorithm against rival Stellar Network.[8][9] Currently, Ripple is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization,[10][11] after bitcoin and Ethereum.[12][13][14][15]
Used by companies such as UniCredit, UBS and Santander, the Ripple protocol has been increasingly adopted by banks and payment networks as settlement infrastructure technology,[16] with American Banker explaining that "from banks' perspective, distributed ledgers like the Ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like bitcoin," including price and security.[17]

History[edit]
Early development (2004–12)[edit]
The predecessor to the Ripple payment protocol, Ripplepay, was first developed in 2004 by Ryan Fugger,[18][19] a web developer in Vancouver, British Columbia.[20] Fugger conceived of the idea after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver, and his intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively allow individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger's first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com,[21] debuted in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network.[20][22]
This led to the conception of a new system by Jed McCaleb of eDonkey network,[23] which was designed and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz.[24] In May 2011, they began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by bitcoin, which relies on blockchain ledgers.[21] This new version of the Ripple system[20] was therefore designed to eliminate bitcoin's reliance on centralized exchanges, use less electricity than bitcoin, and perform transactions much more quickly than bitcoin.[20] Chris Larsen,[21] who had previously founded the lending services companies E-Loan and Prosper, joined the team in August 2012,[23] and together McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins.[21] In September 2012 the team co-founded the corporation OpenCoin,[21] or OpenCoin Inc.[23][25]
OpenCoin and Ripple Labs (2012–13)[edit]
Main article: Ripple (company)
OpenCoin began developing a new payment protocol called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) based on Ryan Fugger's concepts.[21] The Ripple protocol enables the instant and direct transfer of money between two parties.[26] As such the protocol can circumnavigate the fees and wait times of the traditional correspondent banking system,[26][27] and any type of currency can be exchanged including USD, euros, RMB, yen, gold, airline miles, and rupees.[28] To maintain security OpenCoin programmed Ripple to rely on a common ledger that is "managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records." Servers could belong to anyone, including banks or market makers.[26] The company also created its own form of digital currency dubbed XRP in a manner similar to bitcoin, using the currency to allow financial insititutions to transfer money with negligible fees and wait-time.[29]
Among OpenCoin's early investors were[30] Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures.[26] On July 1, 2013, XRP Fund II, LLC (now called simply XRP II)[31] was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of OpenCoin, and headquartered in South Carolina.[31] The following day, Ripple announced its linking of the bitcoin and Ripple protocols via the Bitcoin Bridge. The bitcoin Bridge allows Ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a bitcoin address.[32][33] Ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as ZipZap.[34] On September 26, 2013, OpenCoin Inc. changed its name to Ripple Labs Inc.,[25] with Chris Larsen remaining CEO.[35] On the same day the Ripple reference server and client became free software, released as open source under the terms of the ISC license.[2] Ripple Labs continued as the primary contributors of code to the consensus verification system behind Ripple, which can "integrate with banks’ existing networks."[36] In October 2013, Ripple partnered further with ZipZap, with the relationship called a threat to Western Union in the press.[37]
Focus on banking market (2014–17)[edit]
By 2014, Ripple Labs was involved in several development projects related to the protocol, releasing for example an iOS client app for the iPhone that allows iPhone users to send and receive any currency via their phone.[38][39][40] This Ripple Client app no longer exists.[41] In July 2014, Ripple Labs proposed Codius, a project to develop a new smart contract system that is "programming language agnostic."[42]


"...we think that the bigger opportunity is not just to create another digital currency – there are plenty of those - but rather to use that technology as a way of building a settlement system with no central operator."


— Ripple CEO Chris Larsen in December 2014[28]


Since 2013, the protocol has been adopted by an increasing number of financial institutions to "[offer] an alternative remittance option" to consumers.[43] Ripple allows for cross-border payments for retail customers, corporations, and other banks, and Larsen was quoted stating that "Ripple simplifies the [exchange] process by creating point-to-point and transparent transfers in which banks do not have to pay corresponding bank fees."[28] The first bank to use Ripple was Fidor Bank in Munich, which announced the partnership in early 2014. Fidor is an online-only bank based in Germany.[44] That September the New Jersey-based Cross River Bank and Kansas-based CBW Bank announced they would be using the Ripple protocol.[3] By December Ripple Labs began working with global payments service Earthport, combining Ripple's software with Earthport's payment services system. Earthport's clients include banks such as Bank of America and HSBC, and it operates in 65 countries. The partnership marked the first network usage of the Ripple protocol.[45] In December 2014 alone, the XRP price value rose over 200%, helping Ripple surpass litecoin to become the second biggest crypto-currency, and setting Ripple's market capitalization at close to half a billion.[46]
In February 2015, Fidor Bank announced they would be using the Ripple protocol to implement a new real-time international money transfer network,[47] and in late April 2015, it was announced that Western Union was planning to "experiment" with Ripple.[37] In late May 2015, Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced it would be experimenting with Ripple[48] in relation to intrabank transfers.[49] Since 2012, representatives of Ripple Labs have professed support for government regulation of the crypto-currency market, claiming that regulations help businesses grow.[50] On May 5, 2015, FinCEN fined Ripple Labs and XRP II US$700,000 for violation of the Bank Secrecy Act,[31] based on the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's additions to the act in 2013.[51] Ripple Labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance, which included an agreement to only transact XRP and "Ripple Trade" activity through registered money services businesses (MSB), among other agreements such as enhancing the Ripple Protocol.[31] The enhancement won't change the protocol itself, but will instead add AML transaction monitoring to the network and improve transaction analysis.[51] As of 2017, the current release of the server (known as rippled) is version 0.40.0.[1]
The year 2015 and 2016 marked the expansion of Ripple (company) with the opening of an office in Sydney, Australia in April 2015[52] and the opening of European offices in London, United Kingdom in March 2016[53] then in Luxembourg in June 2016.[54] Many companies have subsequently announced experimenting and integrations with Ripple.[55]

On June 13, 2016, Ripple obtained a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the fourth company with a BitLicense.[76]
On August 19, 2016, SBI Ripple Asia announced the creation of a Japanese consortium of banks in a new network that will use Ripple’s technology for payments and settlement.[77] The consortium was officially launched on October 25, 2016 with 42 member banks.[78] As of July 2017, 61 Japanese banks had joined, representing over 80% of total banking assets in Japan.[79]
On September 23, 2016, Ripple announced the creation of the first interbank group for global payments based on distributed financial technology. As of April 2017, members of the network known as the Global Payments Steering Group (GPSG) are Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Royal Bank of Canada, Santander, Standard Chartered, UniCredit and Westpac Banking Corporation. The group will "oversee the creation and maintenance of Ripple payment transaction rules, formalized standards for activity using Ripple, and other actions to support the implementation of Ripple payment capabilities."[80][81]
Concept[edit]


"...as an open protocol, Ripple enables a peer-to-peer server architecture to facilitate the movement of value among financial institutions. This allows financial services companies to make payments directly to each other, whether across different networks, geographic borders or currencies."


— Consultative Group to Assist the Poor in 2015[82]


Ripple's website describes the opensource protocol as "basic infrastructure technology for interbank transactions – a neutral utility for financial institutions and systems." The protocol allows banks and non-bank financial services companies to incorporate the Ripple protocol into their own systems, and therefore allow their customers to use the service.[83] Currently, Ripple requires two parties for a transaction to occur: first, a regulated financial institution "holds funds and issues balances on behalf of customers." Second, "market makers" such as hedge funds or currency trading desks provide liquidity in the currency they want to trade in.[84] At its core, Ripple is based around a shared, public database or ledger that has its contents decided on by consensus.[6] In addition to balances, the ledger holds information about offers to buy or sell currencies and assets, creating the first distributed exchange.[83] The consensus process allows for payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.[7] According to the CGAP in 2015, "Ripple does for payments what SMTP did for email, which is enable the systems of different financial institutions to communicate directly."[82]
In Ripple, users make payments between each other by using cryptographically signed transactions denominated in either fiat currencies or Ripple's internal currency (XRP). For XRP-denominated transactions Ripple can make use of its internal ledger, while for payments denominated in other assets, the Ripple ledger only records the amounts owed, with assets represented as debt obligations.[18] As originally Ripple only kept records in its ledger and has no real-world enforcement power, trust was required.[18][clarification needed] However, Ripple is now integrated with various user verification protocols and bank services.[85] Users have to specify which other users they trust and to what amount.[18] When a non-XRP payment is made between two users that trust each other, the balance of the mutual credit line is adjusted, subject to limits set by each user. In order to send assets between users that have not directly established a trust relationship, the system tries to find a path between the two users such that each link of the path is between two users that do have a trust relationship. All balances along the path are then adjusted simultaneously and atomically.[18] This mechanism of making payments through a network of trusted associates is named 'rippling'. It has similarities to the age-old hawala system.[86]
Design features[edit]
Gateways[edit]
A gateway is any person or organization that enables users to put money into and take money out of Ripple's liquidity pool.[2] A gateway accepts currency deposits from users and issues balances into Ripple's distributed ledger. Furthermore, gateways redeem ledger balances against the deposits they hold when currency is withdrawn. In practice, gateways are similar to banks, yet they share one global ledger known as the Ripple protocol. Depending on the type and degree of interaction a user has with a gateway, the gateway may have anti-money laundering (AML) or know your customer (KYC) policies requiring verification of identification, address, nationality, etc. to prevent criminal activity.[5] Popular gateways as of 2017 included Bitstamp, Gatehub, Ripple Fox, Tokyo JPY, Mr. Ripple, RippleChina and The Rock Trading.[87]
Trustlines and rippling[edit]
Users must ‘extend trust’ to the Ripple gateway that holds their deposit. This manual creation of a trustline indicates to the Ripple network that the user is comfortable with the gateway’s counterparty risk. Furthermore, the user must put a quantitative limit on this trust and create a similar limit for each currency on deposit at that gateway. For example, if a user deposits US$50 and BTC2.00 at The Rock Trading, the user will have to grant trust of at least that much in both currencies to the gateway for the monies to be available in the Ripple network.[88] When a user has allowed multiple gateways in the same currency, there is an advanced option to allow "rippling," which subjects the user’s balance of that currency to switch (or ripple) between gateways. Though their total balance doesn't alter, users earn a small transit fee for providing inter-gateway liquidity.[89]
Creditworthiness[edit]
Similar to reasons during the Free Banking Era in the United States, the value of a currency can vary significantly depending on a gateway's creditworthiness. A non-profit trade association, the International Ripple Business Association (IRBA), provides unified procedures and disclosure standards for gateways.[90][91][92] As of June 2015[update], fifteen businesses had met or exceeded the IRBA standards.[90][91]
Consensus ledger[edit]
Ripple relies on a common shared ledger, which is a distributed database storing information about all Ripple accounts. The network is "managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records." Servers could belong to anyone, including banks or market makers.[26] Though the Ripple protocol is freeware,[2] Ripple Labs continues to develop and promote the Ripple protocol, which confirms financial transactions via a network of distributed servers. Ripple Labs is currently assisting banks in integrating with the Ripple network.[36] A new ledger is created every few seconds,[93] and the last closed ledger is a perfect record of all Ripple accounts as determined by the network of servers. A transaction is any proposed change to the ledger and can be introduced by any server to the network. The servers attempt to come to consensus about a set of transactions to apply to the ledger, creating a new ‘last closed ledger’.[93]
The consensus process is distributed,[94] and the goal of consensus is for each server to apply the same set of transactions to the current ledger.[93] Servers continually receive transactions from other servers on the network,[93] and the server determines which transactions to apply based on if a transaction came from a specified node in the ‘unique node list’ or UNL.[not in citation given][7] Transactions that are agreed upon by a "supermajority" of peers are considered validated.[93] If the supermajority isn't in consensus, "this implies that transaction volume was too high or network latency too great for the consensus process to produce consistent proposals," then the consensus process is again attempted by the nodes. Each round of consensus reduces disagreement, until the supermajority is reached.[93] The intended outcome of this process is that disputed transactions are discarded from proposals while widely accepted transactions are included.[93] While users may assemble their own UNL nodes and have full control over which nodes they trust, Ripple Labs acknowledges that most people will use the default UNL supplied by their client.[not in citation given][7]
Ledger security[edit]
In early 2014,[95] a rival company called the Stellar Foundation[96] experienced a network crash.[8] The company brought in David Mazieres, Stellar's chief scientist and head of Stanford University's secure computing group, to conduct a review of the Stellar consensus system, which was similar to Ripple's. Mazieres declared the Stellar system unlikely to be safe when operating with "more than one validating node,"[8] arguing that when consensus is not reached, a ledger fork occurs with parts of the network disagreeing over accepted transactions.[9] The Stellar Foundation afterwards claimed that there was an "innate weaknesses" in the consensus process,[8] a claim which according to Finance Magnates, "Ripple vehemently denied."[95] Ripple Labs chief cryptographer David Schwartz disputed Mazieres' findings and declared that Stellar had incorrectly implemented the consensus system, as "the protocol provides safety and fault tolerance assuming the validators are configured correctly."[9] The company further wrote that after examining Stellar's information, they had concluded "that there is no threat to the continued operation of the Ripple network."[97]
Use as a payment/forex system[edit]
Ripple allows users or businesses to conduct cross-currency transactions[98] in 3 to 5 seconds.[83] All accounts and transactions are cryptographically secure and algorithmically verified. Payments can only be authorized by the account holder and all payments are processed automatically without any third parties or intermediaries.[98] Ripple validates accounts and balances instantly for payment transmission and delivers payment notification with very little latency (within a few seconds).[99] Payments are irreversible, and there are no chargebacks.[100] XRP cannot be frozen or seized.[101] While as of 2014 anyone could open an account on Ripple,[101] by 2015 identity verification procedures had been implemented.[85] Ripple's Path-finding Algorithm searches for the fastest, cheapest path between two currencies.[102] In the case of a user who wants to send a payment from USD to EUR, this could be a "one-hop" path directly from USD to EUR, or it could be a multi-hop path, perhaps from USD to CAD to XRP to EUR.[103] Path finding is designed to seek out the cheapest conversion cost for the user. As of May 14, 2014[update], Ripple's gateways allow deposits in a limited number of fiat currencies (USD, EUR, MXN, NZD, GBP, NOK, JPY, CAD, CHF, CNY, AUD), a handful of crypto currencies (BTC, XRP, LTC, NMC, NXT, PPC, XVN, SLL) and a few commodities (gold, silver, platinum).[104][105][106]
The Bitcoin Bridge[edit]
The bitcoin bridge is a link between the Ripple and bitcoin ecosystems. The bridge makes it possible to pay any bitcoin user straight from a Ripple account without ever needing to hold any of the digital currency. Additionally, any merchant accepting bitcoins has the potential to accept any currency in the world. For example, a Ripple user may prefer to keep money in USD and not own bitcoins. A merchant, however, may desire payment in bitcoin. The bitcoin bridge allows any Ripple user to send bitcoins without having to use a central exchange such as BTC-e to acquire them.[33][107] Bitstamp acts as a gateway for the Ripple payment protocol, among other exchanges.
Privacy[edit]
While transaction information on the ledger is public, payment information is not. It’s thus difficult for anyone to associate transaction information with any specific user or corporation.[108]
Market makers[edit]
Any user on Ripple can act as a market maker by offering an arbitrage service such as providing market liquidity, intra-gateway currency conversion, rippling, etc. Market makers can also be hedge funds or currency trading desks. According to the Ripple website, "by holding balances in multiple currencies and connecting to multiple gateways, market makers facilitate payments between users where no direct trust exists, enabling exchanges across gateways."[109] With a sufficient number of market makers, the path finding algorithm creates a near frictionless market and enables users to seamlessly pay each other via the network in different currencies, without assuming any undesired foreign exchange risk.[110]
Many such services are offered through a traditional platform of offers to buy or sell one currency for another currency. Bids and asks are aggregated into order books, to create a decentralized exchange. Users can transact with market makers to trade or convert currencies.[citation needed] Ripple's path finding algorithm leverages this functionality to allow users to send money in one currency and the recipient to receive it in another currency.[110] For example, a user can pay with USD and the recipient can choose to receive the money in another currency, including bitcoins and XRP.[110]
Open API[edit]
Ripple Labs built the protocol to be friendly to the developer community, and resulting features include an API for its payment network, based on the popular REST API standard. One of the earliest extensions by third-party developers was a Ripple extension to e-commerce platform Magento, which enables Magento to read the Ripple public ledger and create an invoice. There has been a Ripple Wallet payment option developed for retail situations as well.[38]

"XRP exists natively within the Ripple protocol as a counterparty-free currency, as Bitcoin does on the Blockchain. Because XRP is an asset, as opposed to a redeemable balance, it does not require that users trust any specific financial institution to trade or exchange it. All other currencies on Ripple do require some amount of trust, as they each have an issuer, from whom that currency can be redeemed (this includes BTC on the Ripple network)."


— Ripple protocol[111]


XRP is the native currency of the Ripple network that only exists within the Ripple system.[112] XRP are currently divisible to 6 decimal places, and the smallest unit is called a drop with 1 million drops equaling 1 XRP.[112] There were 100 billion XRP created at Ripple's inception, with no more allowed to be created according to the protocol's rules.[113] As such, the system was designed so XRP is a scarce asset with decreasing available supply.[113] Not dependent on any third party for redemption, XRP is the only currency in the Ripple network that does not entail counterparty risk, and it is the only native digital asset. The other currencies in the Ripple network are debt instruments (i.e. liabilities), and exist in the form of balances.[2] Users of the Ripple network are not required to use XRP as a store of value or a medium of exchange. Each Ripple account is required, however, to have a small reserve of 20 XRP[114] (US$6.58 as of May 16, 2017[115]). The purpose for this requirement is discussed in the anti-spam section.
Distribution[edit]
Of the 100 billion created, 20 billion XRP were retained by the creators, who were also the founders of Ripple Labs. The creators gave the remaining 80% of the total to Ripple Labs, with the XRP intended "to incentivize market maker activity to increase XRP liquidity and strengthen the overall health of XRP markets."[113][116] Ripple Labs also had a short-lived 2013 giveaway of under 200 million XRP (0.2% of all XRP) with some of the amount given to charities such as the Computing for Good initiative, which began offering XRP in exchange for time volunteered on research projects.[117] As of March 2015, 67% of Ripple Labs's original 80% was still retained by the company,[113] with Ripple Labs stating that "we will engage in distribution strategies that we expect will result in a stable or strengthening XRP exchange rate against other currencies."[118] In May 2017, to alleviate concerns surrounding XRP supply, Ripple committed to place 55 billion XRP (88% of its XRP holdings) into a cryptographically-secured escrow. The escrow will allow them to sell up to 1 billion monthly and return whatever is unused at the end of each month to the back of the escrow queue in the form of an additional month-long contract, starting the process all over.[119][116] The amount of XRP distributed and their movement can be tracked through the Ripple Charts website.[120]
As a bridge currency[edit]
One of the specific functions of XRP is as a bridge currency,[103] which can be necessary if no direct exchange is available between two currencies at a specific time,[121] for example when transacting between two rarely traded currency pairs.[111] Within the network’s currency exchange, XRP are traded freely against other currencies, and its market price fluctuates against dollars, euros, yen, bitcoin, etc. Ripple's design focus is as a currency exchange and a distributed-RTGS, as opposed to emphasizing XRP as an alternative currency.[111] In April 2015, Ripple Labs announced that a new feature called autobridging had been added to Ripple, with the intent of making it easier for market makers to transact between rarely traded currency pairs. The feature is also intended to expose more of the network to liquidity and better FX rates.[122]
As an anti-spam measure[edit]
When a user conducts a financial transaction in a non-native currency, Ripple charges a transaction fee. The purpose of the fees is to protect against network flooding by making the attacks too expensive for hackers. If Ripple were completely free to access, adversaries could broadcast large amounts of "ledger spam" (i.e. fake accounts) and "transaction spam" (i.e. fake transactions) in an attempt to overload the network. This could cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable and interfere with the network’s ability to quickly settle legitimate transactions. Thus, to engage in trade, each Ripple account is required to have a small reserve of 20 XRP,[114] (US$0.16 as of October 3, 2016[115]), and a transaction fee starting at .00001 XRP (US$.00000008 as of October 3, 2016[115]) must be spent for each trade. This transaction fee is not collected by anyone; the XRP is destroyed and ceases to exist.[123] The transaction fee rises if the user posts trades at an enormous rate (many thousands per minute), and resettles after a period of inactivity.[88]
Reception[edit]
Since its debut the Ripple protocol has received a fair amount of attention in both the financial and mainstream press. Ripple has recently been mentioned in industry articles by The Nielsen Company, the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, NACHA, and KPMG, with many of the articles examining Ripple's effect on internationalizing the banking industry.[124] In April 2015, American Banker asserted that "from banks' perspective, distributed ledgers like the Ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin," including security.[17] Wrote the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, "the adoption of distributed networks, such as Ripple, may help the [banking] industry realize faster processing, as well as greater efficiencies for global payments and correspondent banking."[124] Writing for Esquire about Ripple as a payment network in 2013, Ken Kurson said that "the big financial-service brands ought to feel about Ripple the way the record labels felt about Napster."[125] The New York Times website Dealbook points out in 2014 that “[Ripple] is winning something that has proved elusive for virtual currencies: involvement from more mainstream players in the financial system.”[16] In August 2015, Ripple has been awarded as Technology Pioneer by World Economic Forum.[126]

Comparisons to competition

Though Ripple is third in market capitalization to bitcoin as a digital currency,[10] many members of the press have described Ripple as an up-and-coming rival to bitcoin. In late 2014, Bloomberg called bitcoin a "failing" digital currency, after bitcoin's currency fell 54 percent in value in one year. Ripple was described as a significant competitor, in part because of its real-time international money transfers.[127] Bill Gates supported this outlook and mentioned the Ripple system when asked about bitcoin in 2014, stating "there’s a lot that bitcoin or Ripple and variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically. But bitcoin won’t be the dominant system.”[128] About Ripple's allowance of any electronic value holder, the Vice President of the St. Louis Federal Reserve and professor at Simon Fraser University, David Andolfatto, stated in 2014 that "Ripple is a currency-agnostic protocol. Ripple is the winner. It processes anything."[129] For its creation and development of the Ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment/exchange network, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) recognized Ripple Labs as one of 2014's 50 Smartest Companies in the February 2014 edition of MIT Technology Review.[130]

Reactions to XRP

The reaction to XRP is polarized in the crypto-currency community.[7] Proponents of bitcoin have criticized XRP for being "pre-mined," as XRP is built directly into the Ripple protocol and requires no mining. Also, Ripple Labs' distribution of the original limited amount of XRP currency has met with a fair amount of controversy,[95] and in particular the founders' retainment of 20% is seen as a high percentage. However, Esquire countered in 2013 that "if that is devious, then so is every company that's ever gone public while retaining the great bulk of its shares."[125] Much of the controversy was settled after the announcement that the founders[96] Jed McCaleb[131] and Arthur Britto[96] would be selling their XRP at a mediated rate over several years, "a move that should add stability and restore confidence to the XRP market."[96] CEO Chris Larsen in turn donated 7 billion XRP to the Ripple Foundation for Financial Innovation, with the XRP to be "locked up" and donated over time.[132] In 2016, of the 20% allocated initially to the founders, nearly half had been donated to non-profits and charities.[131][132][133]

Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), currency exchange and remittance network by Ripple. Also called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol,[3] it is built upon a distributed open source Internet protocol, consensus ledger and native currency called XRP (ripples). Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable "secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks." It supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes.[4][5] At its core, Ripple is based around a shared, public database or ledger,[6] which uses a consensus process that allows for payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.[7]
In 2014, Ripple defended the security of its consensus algorithm against rival Stellar Network.[8][9] Currently, Ripple is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization,[10][11] after bitcoin and Ethereum.[12][13][14][15]
Used by companies such as UniCredit, UBS and Santander, the Ripple protocol has been increasingly adopted by banks and payment networks as settlement infrastructure technology,[16] with American Banker explaining that "from banks' perspective, distributed ledgers like the Ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like bitcoin," including price and security.[17]

History[edit]
Early development (2004–12)[edit]
The predecessor to the Ripple payment protocol, Ripplepay, was first developed in 2004 by Ryan Fugger,[18][19] a web developer in Vancouver, British Columbia.[20] Fugger conceived of the idea after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver, and his intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively allow individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger's first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com,[21] debuted in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network.[20][22]
This led to the conception of a new system by Jed McCaleb of eDonkey network,[23] which was designed and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz.[24] In May 2011, they began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by bitcoin, which relies on blockchain ledgers.[21] This new version of the Ripple system[20] was therefore designed to eliminate bitcoin's reliance on centralized exchanges, use less electricity than bitcoin, and perform transactions much more quickly than bitcoin.[20] Chris Larsen,[21] who had previously founded the lending services companies E-Loan and Prosper, joined the team in August 2012,[23] and together McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins.[21] In September 2012 the team co-founded the corporation OpenCoin,[21] or OpenCoin Inc.[23][25]
OpenCoin and Ripple Labs (2012–13)[edit]
Main article: Ripple (company)
OpenCoin began developing a new payment protocol called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) based on Ryan Fugger's concepts.[21] The Ripple protocol enables the instant and direct transfer of money between two parties.[26] As such the protocol can circumnavigate the fees and wait times of the traditional correspondent banking system,[26][27] and any type of currency can be exchanged including USD, euros, RMB, yen, gold, airline miles, and rupees.[28] To maintain security OpenCoin programmed Ripple to rely on a common ledger that is "managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records." Servers could belong to anyone, including banks or market makers.[26] The company also created its own form of digital currency dubbed XRP in a manner similar to bitcoin, using the currency to allow financial insititutions to transfer money with negligible fees and wait-time.[29]
Among OpenCoin's early investors were[30] Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures.[26] On July 1, 2013, XRP Fund II, LLC (now called simply XRP II)[31] was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of OpenCoin, and headquartered in South Carolina.[31] The following day, Ripple announced its linking of the bitcoin and Ripple protocols via the Bitcoin Bridge. The bitcoin Bridge allows Ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a bitcoin address.[32][33] Ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as ZipZap.[34] On September 26, 2013, OpenCoin Inc. changed its name to Ripple Labs Inc.,[25] with Chris Larsen remaining CEO.[35] On the same day the Ripple reference server and client became free software, released as open source under the terms of the ISC license.[2] Ripple Labs continued as the primary contributors of code to the consensus verification system behind Ripple, which can "integrate with banks’ existing networks."[36] In October 2013, Ripple partnered further with ZipZap, with the relationship called a threat to Western Union in the press.[37]
Focus on banking market (2014–17)[edit]
By 2014, Ripple Labs was involved in several development projects related to the protocol, releasing for example an iOS client app for the iPhone that allows iPhone users to send and receive any currency via their phone.[38][39][40] This Ripple Client app no longer exists.[41] In July 2014, Ripple Labs proposed Codius, a project to develop a new smart contract system that is "programming language agnostic."[42]


"...we think that the bigger opportunity is not just to create another digital currency – there are plenty of those - but rather to use that technology as a way of building a settlement system with no central operator."


— Ripple CEO Chris Larsen in December 2014[28]


Since 2013, the protocol has been adopted by an increasing number of financial institutions to "[offer] an alternative remittance option" to consumers.[43] Ripple allows for cross-border payments for retail customers, corporations, and other banks, and Larsen was quoted stating that "Ripple simplifies the [exchange] process by creating point-to-point and transparent transfers in which banks do not have to pay corresponding bank fees."[28] The first bank to use Ripple was Fidor Bank in Munich, which announced the partnership in early 2014. Fidor is an online-only bank based in Germany.[44] That September the New Jersey-based Cross River Bank and Kansas-based CBW Bank announced they would be using the Ripple protocol.[3] By December Ripple Labs began working with global payments service Earthport, combining Ripple's software with Earthport's payment services system. Earthport's clients include banks such as Bank of America and HSBC, and it operates in 65 countries. The partnership marked the first network usage of the Ripple protocol.[45] In December 2014 alone, the XRP price value rose over 200%, helping Ripple surpass litecoin to become the second biggest crypto-currency, and setting Ripple's market capitalization at close to half a billion.[46]
In February 2015, Fidor Bank announced they would be using the Ripple protocol to implement a new real-time international money transfer network,[47] and in late April 2015, it was announced that Western Union was planning to "experiment" with Ripple.[37] In late May 2015, Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced it would be experimenting with Ripple[48] in relation to intrabank transfers.[49] Since 2012, representatives of Ripple Labs have professed support for government regulation of the crypto-currency market, claiming that regulations help businesses grow.[50] On May 5, 2015, FinCEN fined Ripple Labs and XRP II US$700,000 for violation of the Bank Secrecy Act,[31] based on the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's additions to the act in 2013.[51] Ripple Labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance, which included an agreement to only transact XRP and "Ripple Trade" activity through registered money services businesses (MSB), among other agreements such as enhancing the Ripple Protocol.[31] The enhancement won't change the protocol itself, but will instead add AML transaction monitoring to the network and improve transaction analysis.[51] As of 2017, the current release of the server (known as rippled) is version 0.40.0.[1]
The year 2015 and 2016 marked the expansion of Ripple (company) with the opening of an office in Sydney, Australia in April 2015[52] and the opening of European offices in London, United Kingdom in March 2016[53] then in Luxembourg in June 2016.[54] Many companies have subsequently announced experimenting and integrations with Ripple.[55]

On June 13, 2016, Ripple obtained a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the fourth company with a BitLicense.[76]
On August 19, 2016, SBI Ripple Asia announced the creation of a Japanese consortium of banks in a new network that will use Ripple’s technology for payments and settlement.[77] The consortium was officially launched on October 25, 2016 with 42 member banks.[78] As of July 2017, 61 Japanese banks had joined, representing over 80% of total banking assets in Japan.[79]
On September 23, 2016, Ripple announced the creation of the first interbank group for global payments based on distributed financial technology. As of April 2017, members of the network known as the Global Payments Steering Group (GPSG) are Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Royal Bank of Canada, Santander, Standard Chartered, UniCredit and Westpac Banking Corporation. The group will "oversee the creation and maintenance of Ripple payment transaction rules, formalized standards for activity using Ripple, and other actions to support the implementation of Ripple payment capabilities."[80][81]
Concept[edit]


"...as an open protocol, Ripple enables a peer-to-peer server architecture to facilitate the movement of value among financial institutions. This allows financial services companies to make payments directly to each other, whether across different networks, geographic borders or currencies."


— Consultative Group to Assist the Poor in 2015[82]


Ripple's website describes the opensource protocol as "basic infrastructure technology for interbank transactions – a neutral utility for financial institutions and systems." The protocol allows banks and non-bank financial services companies to incorporate the Ripple protocol into their own systems, and therefore allow their customers to use the service.[83] Currently, Ripple requires two parties for a transaction to occur: first, a regulated financial institution "holds funds and issues balances on behalf of customers." Second, "market makers" such as hedge funds or currency trading desks provide liquidity in the currency they want to trade in.[84] At its core, Ripple is based around a shared, public database or ledger that has its contents decided on by consensus.[6] In addition to balances, the ledger holds information about offers to buy or sell currencies and assets, creating the first distributed exchange.[83] The consensus process allows for payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.[7] According to the CGAP in 2015, "Ripple does for payments what SMTP did for email, which is enable the systems of different financial institutions to communicate directly."[82]
In Ripple, users make payments between each other by using cryptographically signed transactions denominated in either fiat currencies or Ripple's internal currency (XRP). For XRP-denominated transactions Ripple can make use of its internal ledger, while for payments denominated in other assets, the Ripple ledger only records the amounts owed, with assets represented as debt obligations.[18] As originally Ripple only kept records in its ledger and has no real-world enforcement power, trust was required.[18][clarification needed] However, Ripple is now integrated with various user verification protocols and bank services.[85] Users have to specify which other users they trust and to what amount.[18] When a non-XRP payment is made between two users that trust each other, the balance of the mutual credit line is adjusted, subject to limits set by each user. In order to send assets between users that have not directly established a trust relationship, the system tries to find a path between the two users such that each link of the path is between two users that do have a trust relationship. All balances along the path are then adjusted simultaneously and atomically.[18] This mechanism of making payments through a network of trusted associates is named 'rippling'. It has similarities to the age-old hawala system.[86]
Design features[edit]
Gateways[edit]
A gateway is any person or organization that enables users to put money into and take money out of Ripple's liquidity pool.[2] A gateway accepts currency deposits from users and issues balances into Ripple's distributed ledger. Furthermore, gateways redeem ledger balances against the deposits they hold when currency is withdrawn. In practice, gateways are similar to banks, yet they share one global ledger known as the Ripple protocol. Depending on the type and degree of interaction a user has with a gateway, the gateway may have anti-money laundering (AML) or know your customer (KYC) policies requiring verification of identification, address, nationality, etc. to prevent criminal activity.[5] Popular gateways as of 2017 included Bitstamp, Gatehub, Ripple Fox, Tokyo JPY, Mr. Ripple, RippleChina and The Rock Trading.[87]
Trustlines and rippling[edit]
Users must ‘extend trust’ to the Ripple gateway that holds their deposit. This manual creation of a trustline indicates to the Ripple network that the user is comfortable with the gateway’s counterparty risk. Furthermore, the user must put a quantitative limit on this trust and create a similar limit for each currency on deposit at that gateway. For example, if a user deposits US$50 and BTC2.00 at The Rock Trading, the user will have to grant trust of at least that much in both currencies to the gateway for the monies to be available in the Ripple network.[88] When a user has allowed multiple gateways in the same currency, there is an advanced option to allow "rippling," which subjects the user’s balance of that currency to switch (or ripple) between gateways. Though their total balance doesn't alter, users earn a small transit fee for providing inter-gateway liquidity.[89]
Creditworthiness[edit]
Similar to reasons during the Free Banking Era in the United States, the value of a currency can vary significantly depending on a gateway's creditworthiness. A non-profit trade association, the International Ripple Business Association (IRBA), provides unified procedures and disclosure standards for gateways.[90][91][92] As of June 2015[update], fifteen businesses had met or exceeded the IRBA standards.[90][91]
Consensus ledger[edit]
Ripple relies on a common shared ledger, which is a distributed database storing information about all Ripple accounts. The network is "managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records." Servers could belong to anyone, including banks or market makers.[26] Though the Ripple protocol is freeware,[2] Ripple Labs continues to develop and promote the Ripple protocol, which confirms financial transactions via a network of distributed servers. Ripple Labs is currently assisting banks in integrating with the Ripple network.[36] A new ledger is created every few seconds,[93] and the last closed ledger is a perfect record of all Ripple accounts as determined by the network of servers. A transaction is any proposed change to the ledger and can be introduced by any server to the network. The servers attempt to come to consensus about a set of transactions to apply to the ledger, creating a new ‘last closed ledger’.[93]
The consensus process is distributed,[94] and the goal of consensus is for each server to apply the same set of transactions to the current ledger.[93] Servers continually receive transactions from other servers on the network,[93] and the server determines which transactions to apply based on if a transaction came from a specified node in the ‘unique node list’ or UNL.[not in citation given][7] Transactions that are agreed upon by a "supermajority" of peers are considered validated.[93] If the supermajority isn't in consensus, "this implies that transaction volume was too high or network latency too great for the consensus process to produce consistent proposals," then the consensus process is again attempted by the nodes. Each round of consensus reduces disagreement, until the supermajority is reached.[93] The intended outcome of this process is that disputed transactions are discarded from proposals while widely accepted transactions are included.[93] While users may assemble their own UNL nodes and have full control over which nodes they trust, Ripple Labs acknowledges that most people will use the default UNL supplied by their client.[not in citation given][7]
Ledger security[edit]
In early 2014,[95] a rival company called the Stellar Foundation[96] experienced a network crash.[8] The company brought in David Mazieres, Stellar's chief scientist and head of Stanford University's secure computing group, to conduct a review of the Stellar consensus system, which was similar to Ripple's. Mazieres declared the Stellar system unlikely to be safe when operating with "more than one validating node,"[8] arguing that when consensus is not reached, a ledger fork occurs with parts of the network disagreeing over accepted transactions.[9] The Stellar Foundation afterwards claimed that there was an "innate weaknesses" in the consensus process,[8] a claim which according to Finance Magnates, "Ripple vehemently denied."[95] Ripple Labs chief cryptographer David Schwartz disputed Mazieres' findings and declared that Stellar had incorrectly implemented the consensus system, as "the protocol provides safety and fault tolerance assuming the validators are configured correctly."[9] The company further wrote that after examining Stellar's information, they had concluded "that there is no threat to the continued operation of the Ripple network."[97]
Use as a payment/forex system[edit]
Ripple allows users or businesses to conduct cross-currency transactions[98] in 3 to 5 seconds.[83] All accounts and transactions are cryptographically secure and algorithmically verified. Payments can only be authorized by the account holder and all payments are processed automatically without any third parties or intermediaries.[98] Ripple validates accounts and balances instantly for payment transmission and delivers payment notification with very little latency (within a few seconds).[99] Payments are irreversible, and there are no chargebacks.[100] XRP cannot be frozen or seized.[101] While as of 2014 anyone could open an account on Ripple,[101] by 2015 identity verification procedures had been implemented.[85] Ripple's Path-finding Algorithm searches for the fastest, cheapest path between two currencies.[102] In the case of a user who wants to send a payment from USD to EUR, this could be a "one-hop" path directly from USD to EUR, or it could be a multi-hop path, perhaps from USD to CAD to XRP to EUR.[103] Path finding is designed to seek out the cheapest conversion cost for the user. As of May 14, 2014[update], Ripple's gateways allow deposits in a limited number of fiat currencies (USD, EUR, MXN, NZD, GBP, NOK, JPY, CAD, CHF, CNY, AUD), a handful of crypto currencies (BTC, XRP, LTC, NMC, NXT, PPC, XVN, SLL) and a few commodities (gold, silver, platinum).[104][105][106]
The Bitcoin Bridge[edit]
The bitcoin bridge is a link between the Ripple and bitcoin ecosystems. The bridge makes it possible to pay any bitcoin user straight from a Ripple account without ever needing to hold any of the digital currency. Additionally, any merchant accepting bitcoins has the potential to accept any currency in the world. For example, a Ripple user may prefer to keep money in USD and not own bitcoins. A merchant, however, may desire payment in bitcoin. The bitcoin bridge allows any Ripple user to send bitcoins without having to use a central exchange such as BTC-e to acquire them.[33][107] Bitstamp acts as a gateway for the Ripple payment protocol, among other exchanges.
Privacy[edit]
While transaction information on the ledger is public, payment information is not. It’s thus difficult for anyone to associate transaction information with any specific user or corporation.[108]
Market makers[edit]
Any user on Ripple can act as a market maker by offering an arbitrage service such as providing market liquidity, intra-gateway currency conversion, rippling, etc. Market makers can also be hedge funds or currency trading desks. According to the Ripple website, "by holding balances in multiple currencies and connecting to multiple gateways, market makers facilitate payments between users where no direct trust exists, enabling exchanges across gateways."[109] With a sufficient number of market makers, the path finding algorithm creates a near frictionless market and enables users to seamlessly pay each other via the network in different currencies, without assuming any undesired foreign exchange risk.[110]
Many such services are offered through a traditional platform of offers to buy or sell one currency for another currency. Bids and asks are aggregated into order books, to create a decentralized exchange. Users can transact with market makers to trade or convert currencies.[citation needed] Ripple's path finding algorithm leverages this functionality to allow users to send money in one currency and the recipient to receive it in another currency.[110] For example, a user can pay with USD and the recipient can choose to receive the money in another currency, including bitcoins and XRP.[110]
Open API[edit]
Ripple Labs built the protocol to be friendly to the developer community, and resulting features include an API for its payment network, based on the popular REST API standard. One of the earliest extensions by third-party developers was a Ripple extension to e-commerce platform Magento, which enables Magento to read the Ripple public ledger and create an invoice. There has been a Ripple Wallet payment option developed for retail situations as well.[38]

"XRP exists natively within the Ripple protocol as a counterparty-free currency, as Bitcoin does on the Blockchain. Because XRP is an asset, as opposed to a redeemable balance, it does not require that users trust any specific financial institution to trade or exchange it. All other currencies on Ripple do require some amount of trust, as they each have an issuer, from whom that currency can be redeemed (this includes BTC on the Ripple network)."


— Ripple protocol[111]


XRP is the native currency of the Ripple network that only exists within the Ripple system.[112] XRP are currently divisible to 6 decimal places, and the smallest unit is called a drop with 1 million drops equaling 1 XRP.[112] There were 100 billion XRP created at Ripple's inception, with no more allowed to be created according to the protocol's rules.[113] As such, the system was designed so XRP is a scarce asset with decreasing available supply.[113] Not dependent on any third party for redemption, XRP is the only currency in the Ripple network that does not entail counterparty risk, and it is the only native digital asset. The other currencies in the Ripple network are debt instruments (i.e. liabilities), and exist in the form of balances.[2] Users of the Ripple network are not required to use XRP as a store of value or a medium of exchange. Each Ripple account is required, however, to have a small reserve of 20 XRP[114] (US$6.58 as of May 16, 2017[115]). The purpose for this requirement is discussed in the anti-spam section.
Distribution[edit]
Of the 100 billion created, 20 billion XRP were retained by the creators, who were also the founders of Ripple Labs. The creators gave the remaining 80% of the total to Ripple Labs, with the XRP intended "to incentivize market maker activity to increase XRP liquidity and strengthen the overall health of XRP markets."[113][116] Ripple Labs also had a short-lived 2013 giveaway of under 200 million XRP (0.2% of all XRP) with some of the amount given to charities such as the Computing for Good initiative, which began offering XRP in exchange for time volunteered on research projects.[117] As of March 2015, 67% of Ripple Labs's original 80% was still retained by the company,[113] with Ripple Labs stating that "we will engage in distribution strategies that we expect will result in a stable or strengthening XRP exchange rate against other currencies."[118] In May 2017, to alleviate concerns surrounding XRP supply, Ripple committed to place 55 billion XRP (88% of its XRP holdings) into a cryptographically-secured escrow. The escrow will allow them to sell up to 1 billion monthly and return whatever is unused at the end of each month to the back of the escrow queue in the form of an additional month-long contract, starting the process all over.[119][116] The amount of XRP distributed and their movement can be tracked through the Ripple Charts website.[120]
As a bridge currency[edit]
One of the specific functions of XRP is as a bridge currency,[103] which can be necessary if no direct exchange is available between two currencies at a specific time,[121] for example when transacting between two rarely traded currency pairs.[111] Within the network’s currency exchange, XRP are traded freely against other currencies, and its market price fluctuates against dollars, euros, yen, bitcoin, etc. Ripple's design focus is as a currency exchange and a distributed-RTGS, as opposed to emphasizing XRP as an alternative currency.[111] In April 2015, Ripple Labs announced that a new feature called autobridging had been added to Ripple, with the intent of making it easier for market makers to transact between rarely traded currency pairs. The feature is also intended to expose more of the network to liquidity and better FX rates.[122]
As an anti-spam measure[edit]
When a user conducts a financial transaction in a non-native currency, Ripple charges a transaction fee. The purpose of the fees is to protect against network flooding by making the attacks too expensive for hackers. If Ripple were completely free to access, adversaries could broadcast large amounts of "ledger spam" (i.e. fake accounts) and "transaction spam" (i.e. fake transactions) in an attempt to overload the network. This could cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable and interfere with the network’s ability to quickly settle legitimate transactions. Thus, to engage in trade, each Ripple account is required to have a small reserve of 20 XRP,[114] (US$0.16 as of October 3, 2016[115]), and a transaction fee starting at .00001 XRP (US$.00000008 as of October 3, 2016[115]) must be spent for each trade. This transaction fee is not collected by anyone; the XRP is destroyed and ceases to exist.[123] The transaction fee rises if the user posts trades at an enormous rate (many thousands per minute), and resettles after a period of inactivity.[88]
Reception[edit]
Since its debut the Ripple protocol has received a fair amount of attention in both the financial and mainstream press. Ripple has recently been mentioned in industry articles by The Nielsen Company, the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, NACHA, and KPMG, with many of the articles examining Ripple's effect on internationalizing the banking industry.[124] In April 2015, American Banker asserted that "from banks' perspective, distributed ledgers like the Ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin," including security.[17] Wrote the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, "the adoption of distributed networks, such as Ripple, may help the [banking] industry realize faster processing, as well as greater efficiencies for global payments and correspondent banking."[124] Writing for Esquire about Ripple as a payment network in 2013, Ken Kurson said that "the big financial-service brands ought to feel about Ripple the way the record labels felt about Napster."[125] The New York Times website Dealbook points out in 2014 that “[Ripple] is winning something that has proved elusive for virtual currencies: involvement from more mainstream players in the financial system.”[16] In August 2015, Ripple has been awarded as Technology Pioneer by World Economic Forum.[126]

Comparisons to competition

Though Ripple is third in market capitalization to bitcoin as a digital currency,[10] many members of the press have described Ripple as an up-and-coming rival to bitcoin. In late 2014, Bloomberg called bitcoin a "failing" digital currency, after bitcoin's currency fell 54 percent in value in one year. Ripple was described as a significant competitor, in part because of its real-time international money transfers.[127] Bill Gates supported this outlook and mentioned the Ripple system when asked about bitcoin in 2014, stating "there’s a lot that bitcoin or Ripple and variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically. But bitcoin won’t be the dominant system.”[128] About Ripple's allowance of any electronic value holder, the Vice President of the St. Louis Federal Reserve and professor at Simon Fraser University, David Andolfatto, stated in 2014 that "Ripple is a currency-agnostic protocol. Ripple is the winner. It processes anything."[129] For its creation and development of the Ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment/exchange network, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) recognized Ripple Labs as one of 2014's 50 Smartest Companies in the February 2014 edition of MIT Technology Review.[130]

Reactions to XRP

The reaction to XRP is polarized in the crypto-currency community.[7] Proponents of bitcoin have criticized XRP for being "pre-mined," as XRP is built directly into the Ripple protocol and requires no mining. Also, Ripple Labs' distribution of the original limited amount of XRP currency has met with a fair amount of controversy,[95] and in particular the founders' retainment of 20% is seen as a high percentage. However, Esquire countered in 2013 that "if that is devious, then so is every company that's ever gone public while retaining the great bulk of its shares."[125] Much of the controversy was settled after the announcement that the founders[96] Jed McCaleb[131] and Arthur Britto[96] would be selling their XRP at a mediated rate over several years, "a move that should add stability and restore confidence to the XRP market."[96] CEO Chris Larsen in turn donated 7 billion XRP to the Ripple Foundation for Financial Innovation, with the XRP to be "locked up" and donated over time.[132] In 2016, of the 20% allocated initially to the founders, nearly half had been donated to non-profits and charities.[131][132][133]

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tuesday, May 5, 2015 
Ripple Labs Inc. Resolves Criminal Investigation
SAN FRANCISCO – Ripple Labs Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary, XRP II, LLC (formerly XRP Fund II, LLC), have agreed to resolve a criminal investigation in exchange for a Settlement Agreement calling for a series of substantial remedial measures, including a migration of a portion of Ripple’s virtual currency business to a separate entity; the company’s ongoing cooperation in other investigations; an extensive remedial framework to ensure future compliance with federal laws; and forfeiture and penalties totaling $700,000, announced United States Attorney Melinda Haag, U.S. Treasury Department Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery, and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division Chief Richard Weber.  The agreement will resolve allegations that Ripple and its subsidiary failed to follow the law while engaging in the exchange of virtual currency and that the entities failed to establish and maintain an appropriate anti-money laundering program.
Ripple Labs Inc. is headquartered in San Francisco and developed and sold virtual currency known as “XRP.”  As of 2015, the currency of the Ripple network, XRP, is the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization.
The agreement formalizes the steps Ripple and its subsidiary must take to bring its virtual currency operation within the existing regulatory framework for money services businesses.  The agreement consists of a Settlement Agreement, an agreed Statement of Facts, and a Remedial Framework for the company going forward.  Aside from monetary penalties in the form of forfeiture, the Remedial Framework requires the migration of any component of Ripple’s business that is engaged in the exchange of virtual currency into an entity registered with FinCEN.  In addition, the agreement calls for continued enhancements to the company’s anti-money laundering (AML) controls and training program.  Further, the Remedial Framework calls for external audits through the year 2020, enhancements to the Ripple Protocol, increased transaction monitoring, and an extensive review of historical activity.
“By these agreements, we demonstrate again that we will remain vigilant to ensure the security of, and prevent the misuse of, the financial markets,” said U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag.  “Ripple Labs Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary both have acknowledged that digital currency providers have an obligation not only to refrain from illegal activity, but also to ensure they are not profiting by creating products that allow would-be criminals to avoid detection.  We hope that this sets an industry standard in the important new space of digital currency.”
The agreement is the culmination of a criminal investigation conducted by U.S. Attorney’s office and the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation Division.  FinCEN joined the investigation with a parallel civil enforcement action.  In that action, Ripple Labs and XRP II have agreed to pay a $700,000 civil penalty, $450,000 of which will be designated a forfeiture to settle issues raised in the U.S. Attorney’s investigation.  “Virtual currency exchangers must bring products to market that comply with our anti-money laundering laws," said FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery.  "Innovation is laudable but only as long as it does not unreasonably expose our financial system to tech-smart criminals eager to abuse the latest and most complex products.”
“Federal laws that regulate the reporting of financial transactions are in place to detect and stop illegal activities, including those in the virtual currency arena,” said Richard Weber, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation, “Unregulated, virtual currency opens the door for criminals to anonymously conduct illegal activities online, eroding our financial systems and creating a Wild West environment where following the law is a choice rather than a requirement.”
Ripple described itself as an exchanger of virtual currency in a December 2013, filing made in San Francisco federal court in an unrelated case.  As an exchanger, Ripple was required to register with FinCEN and to comply with applicable federal laws and regulations.  Yet Ripple sold XRP even though it had not registered with FinCEN, effectuating sales of over approximately $1.3 million U.S. dollars in April 2013 alone.  Ripple also failed to establish and maintain an appropriate AML program, and failed to have policies, procedures, and internal controls to ensure compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws.  In July 2013, Ripple incorporated a subsidiary, now known as XRP II, that replaced Ripple as the seller of XRP.  Although XRP II registered with FinCEN, it failed to have an effective AML program or to file appropriate suspicious activity reports.   In late 2013, for example, it negotiated a $250,000 transaction with an individual who had prior felony convictions for dealing in explosive devices and had been sentenced to prison, failing to follow its own internal “know your customer” requirements.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kathryn R. Haun and Arvon J. Perteet handled the matter on behalf of the U.S. Attorney’s Office with the assistance of Daniel Charlier-Smith and Leslie Cook.  The Settlement Agreement with Ripple Labs was the result of a coordinated effort by the United States Attorney’s Office and IRS Criminal Investigation, working in tandem with FinCEN.

History[edit]
Ryan Fugger conceived Ripple in 2004 after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver. The intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger later built the first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com. Concurrently, in May 2011, Jed McCaleb began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by Bitcoin. In August 2012, Jed McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and they approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin.[3]
OpenCoin began development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. On 11 April 2013, OpenCoin announced it had closed an angel round of funding with several venture capital firms. That same month, OpenCoin acquired SimpleHoney to help it popularize virtual currencies and make them easier for average users.[4] On 14 May 2013, OpenCoin announced that it had closed a second round of angel funding.[5] In July 2013, Jed McCaleb separated from active employment with Ripple.[6]
On 26 September 2013, OpenCoin officially changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc.[1] Their CTO, Stefan Thomas, further announced that the source code for the peer-to-peer node behind the Ripple payment network was officially open source. Parts of Ripple, particularly a JavaScript-based web client, had been open source months before, but the release of the peer-to-peer "full node" Rippled meant that the community now had the required tools needed to maintain the Ripple network on its own.[7]
On 5 May 2015, Ripple received a US$700,000 (equivalent to $707,272 in 2016) civil money penalty from U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).[8]
On 6 October 2015, the company was rebranded from Ripple Labs to Ripple.[9]
On June 13, 2016, Ripple obtained a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the fourth company with a BitLicense.[10]
Business model[edit]
Ripple is a privately funded company. It has closed five rounds of funding, which included two rounds of angel funding, one round of seed funding, one Series A round and one Series B round.[4][11][12][13][14][2]

Revenue[edit]
Ripple's revenue sources include professional services provided to financial network operators being integrated with Ripple, software built to integrate legacy financial systems with Ripple and the native currency (XRP). Ripple is also backed by several established investors that provide an additional layer of financial stability.[15]
Programs and projects[edit]
Charitable contributions[edit]
Of the XRP80 billion that Ripple Labs was gifted, Ripple follows a distribution strategy that encompasses payments to business partners such as gateways, market makers and charitable organizations.[16]
Ripple Labs began working with the World Community Grid in November 2013. The World Community Grid pools surplus processing power from volunteers’ computers and electronic devices to support humanitarian causes such as fighting AIDS, improving solar energy and defeating cancer. Individuals who join the Ripple Labs team and donate their spare processing power are rewarded with XRP. As of 18 March 2014, Ripple Labs has given away XRP134,528,800 through the World Community Grid at a rate of XRP1,250,000 per day.[17][18][19]
Software development[edit]
Ripple Labs launched a developer portal designed to bring together tools and resources for the developer community. These include an API for its payment network, based on the popular REST API standard. The firm also developed a bounty program for third-party developers, to encourage them to create services for its combined protocol and payment network.The first one was claimed by developer Mathijs Koenraadt who developed a Ripple extension to e-commerce platform Magento. The extension enables Magento to read the Ripple public ledger and create an invoice. European luxury jewelry outlet Rita Zachari has adopted it, and is one of the first merchants to offer a Ripple Wallet payment option at checkout.[20]
Ripple Labs has been involved in several development projects related to the protocol, releasing for example an iOS client app for the iPhone that allows iPhone users to send and receive any currency via their phone.[20][21][22] This Ripple Client app no longer exists.[23]
On 2 July 2013, Ripple Labs announced its linking of the Bitcoin and Ripple protocols via the Bitcoin bridge. The Bitcoin Bridge allows Ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a Bitcoin address.[24][25]
Partnerships and initiatives[edit]
In March 2014, CrossCoin Ventures launched an accelerator which funds companies that work to advance the Ripple ecosystem. The firm funds accepted startups with up to US$50,000 (equivalent to $50,583 in 2016) in XRP, Ripple's native currency, in exchange for a 3% to 6% stake in diluted common stock. Mentorship and support is provided by CrossCoin and Ripple Labs, Inc.[26]
Ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as ZipZap,[27] with the relationship called a threat to Western Union in the press.[28]
In cooperation with other industry leaders, Ripple Labs became a co-founding member of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA) in July 2013. DATA provides best practices and technical standards, including anti-money laundering compliance guidance for companies that work with digital currency and other emerging payments systems. The committee works as a liaison among public officials, businesses and consumers and create common rules to protect consumers. The initiative attempts to create a cohesive voice of Bitcoin community members when interacting with regulators.[29][30]
Awards and recognitions[edit]
For its creation and development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment/exchange network, the magazine MIT Technology Review recognized Ripple Labs as one of 2014's 50 Smartest Companies in its February 2014 issue. The criteria for the recognition revolved around "whether a company had made strides in the past year that will define its field."[31]
On 9 February 2014, Ripple Labs was named as a finalist for a 2014 PYMNTS Innovator Award in two separate categories: Best New Technology as well as Most Disruptive Company. The recognition pertains to Ripple Labs work in creating Ripple, an open-source, distributed payment protocol powering a new global value web.[32]
On 12 January 2016, Ripple was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 8 in the list of 100 Most Influential Blockchain Organisations.[33][34]
Other Awards:

March 2016 - PYMNTS Innovation Project 2016. Best B2B Innovation Award.[40]

June 2016 - Fortune. 5 Hottest Companies in Fintech.[41]

Fincen fines Ripple for bank secrecy act violations[edit]
On May 5, 2015, FinCEN fined Ripple Labs and XRP II US$700,000 for violation of the Bank Secrecy Act,[42] based on the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's anti-money laundering (AML) additions to the act in 2013.[43] Ripple Labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance, which included an agreement to only transact XRP and "Ripple Trade" activity through registered money services businesses (MSB), among other agreements such as enhancing the Ripple Protocol.[42] The enhancement won't change the protocol itself, but will instead add AML transaction monitoring to the network and improve transaction analysis.[43]

Revenue[edit]
Ripple's revenue sources include professional services provided to financial network operators being integrated with Ripple, software built to integrate legacy financial systems with Ripple and the native currency (XRP). Ripple is also backed by several established investors that provide an additional layer of financial stability.[15]
Programs and projects[edit]
Charitable contributions[edit]
Of the XRP80 billion that Ripple Labs was gifted, Ripple follows a distribution strategy that encompasses payments to business partners such as gateways, market makers and charitable organizations.[16]
Ripple Labs began working with the World Community Grid in November 2013. The World Community Grid pools surplus processing power from volunteers’ computers and electronic devices to support humanitarian causes such as fighting AIDS, improving solar energy and defeating cancer. Individuals who join the Ripple Labs team and donate their spare processing power are rewarded with XRP. As of 18 March 2014, Ripple Labs has given away XRP134,528,800 through the World Community Grid at a rate of XRP1,250,000 per day.[17][18][19]
Software development[edit]
Ripple Labs launched a developer portal designed to bring together tools and resources for the developer community. These include an API for its payment network, based on the popular REST API standard. The firm also developed a bounty program for third-party developers, to encourage them to create services for its combined protocol and payment network.The first one was claimed by developer Mathijs Koenraadt who developed a Ripple extension to e-commerce platform Magento. The extension enables Magento to read the Ripple public ledger and create an invoice. European luxury jewelry outlet Rita Zachari has adopted it, and is one of the first merchants to offer a Ripple Wallet payment option at checkout.[20]
Ripple Labs has been involved in several development projects related to the protocol, releasing for example an iOS client app for the iPhone that allows iPhone users to send and receive any currency via their phone.[20][21][22] This Ripple Client app no longer exists.[23]
On 2 July 2013, Ripple Labs announced its linking of the Bitcoin and Ripple protocols via the Bitcoin bridge. The Bitcoin Bridge allows Ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a Bitcoin address.[24][25]
Partnerships and initiatives[edit]
In March 2014, CrossCoin Ventures launched an accelerator which funds companies that work to advance the Ripple ecosystem. The firm funds accepted startups with up to US$50,000 (equivalent to $50,583 in 2016) in XRP, Ripple's native currency, in exchange for a 3% to 6% stake in diluted common stock. Mentorship and support is provided by CrossCoin and Ripple Labs, Inc.[26]
Ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as ZipZap,[27] with the relationship called a threat to Western Union in the press.[28]
In cooperation with other industry leaders, Ripple Labs became a co-founding member of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA) in July 2013. DATA provides best practices and technical standards, including anti-money laundering compliance guidance for companies that work with digital currency and other emerging payments systems. The committee works as a liaison among public officials, businesses and consumers and create common rules to protect consumers. The initiative attempts to create a cohesive voice of Bitcoin community members when interacting with regulators.[29][30]
Awards and recognitions[edit]
For its creation and development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment/exchange network, the magazine MIT Technology Review recognized Ripple Labs as one of 2014's 50 Smartest Companies in its February 2014 issue. The criteria for the recognition revolved around "whether a company had made strides in the past year that will define its field."[31]
On 9 February 2014, Ripple Labs was named as a finalist for a 2014 PYMNTS Innovator Award in two separate categories: Best New Technology as well as Most Disruptive Company. The recognition pertains to Ripple Labs work in creating Ripple, an open-source, distributed payment protocol powering a new global value web.[32]
On 12 January 2016, Ripple was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 8 in the list of 100 Most Influential Blockchain Organisations.[33][34]
Other Awards:

February 2015 - Fast Company. The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies Of 2015 In Money.[35]

February 2015 - American Banker. 20 Fintech Companies to Watch.[36]

August 2015 - Ripple Labs Awarded as Technology Pioneer by World Economic Forum.[37]

December 2015 - Forbes. Fintech 50.[38]

December 2015 - H2 Ventures, KPMG. Fintech 100.[39]

March 2016 - PYMNTS Innovation Project 2016. Best B2B Innovation Award.[40]

June 2016 - Fortune. 5 Hottest Companies in Fintech.[41]

Fincen fines Ripple for bank secrecy act violations[edit]
On May 5, 2015, FinCEN fined Ripple Labs and XRP II US$700,000 for violation of the Bank Secrecy Act,[42] based on the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's anti-money laundering (AML) additions to the act in 2013.[43] Ripple Labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance, which included an agreement to only transact XRP and "Ripple Trade" activity through registered money services businesses (MSB), among other agreements such as enhancing the Ripple Protocol.[42] The enhancement won't change the protocol itself, but will instead add AML transaction monitoring to the network and improve transaction analysis.[43]

Ripple’s solution is built around an open, neutral protocol (Interledger Protocol or ILP) to power payments across different ledgers and networks globally. It offers a cryptographically secure end-to-end payment flow with transaction immutability and information redundancy. Architected to fit within a bank’s existing infrastructure, Ripple is designed to comply with risk, privacy and compliance requirements.






















Interledger Protocol (ILP)






        All banks and payment providers — from the smallest to the largest — can leverage the Interledger Protocol to securely and efficiently transact cross currency. ILP can work with any new network or system, regardless of its underlying technology. It ensures the payment speed and certainty necessary to service high volumes of all payment types and sizes, while making them cost-effective for customers and profitable for banks.
      









Ripple Connect






        Ripple Connect links the ledgers of financial institutions through ILP for real-time settlement of cross-border payments in a way that preserves the ledger and transaction privacy of the financial institution. Additionally, Ripple Connect provides a way for banks to exchange originator and beneficiary information, fees and the estimated delivery time of the payment before it is initiated — providing unprecedented visibility into each transaction.  
      









Key Features





Distributed


Direct bank-to-bank settlement with no central operator
Decentralized network containing a single source of truth
Transaction immutability and information redundancy




Secure


Complete transaction privacy for each financial institution
PII data stays behind your bank’s firewall
Transactions cryptographically signed using ECDSA and ED25519 algorithms





Scalable


Capacity to process the world’s cross-border payments volume
Unbounded transaction processing capability
Option to access liquidity through a competitive FX marketplace




Interoperable


Ability for banks on different networks to transact directly
Integration with existing systems and standards
Ability to connect traditional and emerging financial networks

Enabling the Internet of Value
Global commerce is rapidly changing. Businesses are increasingly global from day one and consumers are programmed to expect on demand delivery of services and information. Yet, the current infrastructure for payments is woefully inadequate to meet these needs.
Ripple works with banks to transform how they send money around the world — a necessary step to compete in today’s growing economy. Our vision is to enable the Internet of Value so the world can move value the way it moves information today.

Welcome
 
The Northern District of California is undoubtedly one of the most exceptional districts in the nation. The District stretches from the Monterey Coast in the south to California’s northern border with Oregon, and the Pacific Ocean in the west nearly to Sacramento in the east. It contains three major metropolitan areas that are very different politically, culturally and from a law enforcement perspective: San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose. Nearly 8 million people call the Northern District of California home.
In an effort to help protect these individuals, the United States Attorney's Office prosecutes violations of federal law and represents the federal government in virtually all litigation involving the United States in the District. The attorneys who work in the office prosecute criminal violations, civil lawsuits against the government, and litigate actions to collect judgments and restitution on behalf of victims and taxpayers.
