Port Out Request Types
A simple porting request is defined as a single TN on a single account. The target interval for processing simple requests is within 8 business hours of receiving the request, with the port out to be completed in 2 business days.
A non-simple or complex porting request is defined as any request involving more than one TN. The target interval for processing non-simple requests is within 3 business days of receiving the request, with the port out to be completed within 5 business days.
A project porting request is defined as any request involving 50 or more TNs and multiple carriers. These migrations will be handled as a project with negotiated due date intervals.
Requesting a Port Out
To process a request for TN port out, the TN must be a valid West Telecom Services telephone number on the West Telecom Services network. West Telecom Services is only able to process port out requests against its inventory.
To process your request, we require that the customer information submitted on the Local Service Request (LSR) match West Telecom Services records.
Send LSRs to TSLNP@West.com
FOC dates are valid for 5 CALENDAR days including FOC date.
West Telecom Services does not provide concurrence. The Carrier Provider is expected to build NPAC subscriptions in enough time for auto-concurrence.
West Telecom Services does not port out inactive numbers. Only existing customers with active TNs may re-activate numbers.
Cancellations/Supplemental Orders
Requested changes to the approved FOC date must be submitted before 3:00pm CST one business day prior to the FOC date via email with the subject “Sup and PON number”.
Same Day Supplemental or Cancel Requests
If you are trying to sup or cancel an LSR on the day of the FOC or after FOC, you must send an email with your PON and LSR IS to TSLNP@west.com.
*Please put “same day cancel” (or sup) in the subject line. We will respond within 4 business hours if received prior to 3:00pm CST. Any requests received after 3:00pm CST will be worked on a case-by-case basis.
Please make sure accurate email addresses are provided in the LSR request for both the primary and secondary contact, if one is selected.
Status Requests
Status requests may be submitted to TSLNP@west.com with the subject “DID Port Status”.
Snapbacks
West Telecom Services does not accept a snapback request due to real-time provisioning constraints. If customers wish to disallow a prior port request and return the telephone number to West Telecom Services, customers must accomplish this through West Telecom Services’ sales team.
West Telecom Services will use its best efforts to work around this rule for first responders who are out of service, where possible. However, system limitations may prevent acceptance of snapbacks, even in these situations.
