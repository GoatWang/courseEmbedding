                    "Success is defined many times in life as doing something very well and sometimes only one thing. That can be true in business as well, and we have chosen treatment for patients with cancer as a singular focus by which to measure success. In doing so we have the opportunity to do the right thing very well for the benefit of medicine, patients, physicians, payers and the healthcare system overall. Having seen both family members and friends die from cancer in recent years, I can think of no better way to spend my day than helping others who will be faced with similar circumstances in the future.”
