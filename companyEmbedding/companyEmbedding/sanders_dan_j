Description

                    Unless you manage a hook-and-ladder company, your workday shouldn't be spent putting out fires. Yet leaders often spend most of their time running from crisis to crisis.
In his groundbreaking New York Times bestseller Built to Serve, United Supermarkets CEO Dan Sanders showed how putting profi ts before people encourages organizational chaos, saps motivation, stifles innovation, and undercuts competitiveness. He also unveiled a revolutionary peoplecentered business model championed by United and challenged other business leaders to put the human factor first.
In this follow-up to that inspirational bestseller, Dan and coauthor Galen Walters provide the tools needed to put the people-first model to work in your company. You'll master the 4Ps critical to long-term success: People, Process, Partners, and Performance. And you will create an organization that puts front-line people before bottom-line profits, allowing you and your organization to profit more than you ever thought possible.
Equipped to Lead gives you tools to create an organization where
ROIH (return on investment in humanity) drives the bottom line
The Employee Satisfaction Ratio is a key component of every P&L statement
Workplace chaos is transformed into a creative corporate culture
Employees are equipped for higher levels of success

Whether you lead a sprawling international conglomerate or a staff of thirty, using the proven tools and techniques in Equipped to Lead will help you and your organization realize maximum potential-in your people, in your performance, and in your profits.show more

Description

                    Unless you manage a hook-and-ladder company, your workday shouldn't be spent putting out fires. Yet leaders often spend most of their time running from crisis to crisis.
In his groundbreaking New York Times bestseller Built to Serve, United Supermarkets CEO Dan Sanders showed how putting profi ts before people encourages organizational chaos, saps motivation, stifles innovation, and undercuts competitiveness. He also unveiled a revolutionary peoplecentered business model championed by United and challenged other business leaders to put the human factor first.
In this follow-up to that inspirational bestseller, Dan and coauthor Galen Walters provide the tools needed to put the people-first model to work in your company. You'll master the 4Ps critical to long-term success: People, Process, Partners, and Performance. And you will create an organization that puts front-line people before bottom-line profits, allowing you and your organization to profit more than you ever thought possible.
Equipped to Lead gives you tools to create an organization where
ROIH (return on investment in humanity) drives the bottom line
The Employee Satisfaction Ratio is a key component of every P&L statement
Workplace chaos is transformed into a creative corporate culture
Employees are equipped for higher levels of success

Whether you lead a sprawling international conglomerate or a staff of thirty, using the proven tools and techniques in Equipped to Lead will help you and your organization realize maximum potential-in your people, in your performance, and in your profits.show more

          Built to Serve: How to Drive the Bottom Line with People-First Practices
        

    By 
      Dan J Sanders



In "Built to Serve," Dan Sanders, CEO of the award-winning, service-oriented United Supermarkets, makes this bold claim: the prevailing business culture is broken and a radical transformation is required-a paradigm shift that reshapes our understanding of the true purpose of work. Leaders have a choice-continue to chase a broken price-profit model and suffer the consequences or build a culture committed to servanthood and discover the fulfillment evident when people see their work as a ministry. The choice leaders make will not only determine economic success and failure but also will determine their organization's long term impact on humanity. The time is now. Sanders reveals how your people can adopt United's mission of Ultimate Service, Superior Performance, Positive Impact. He distills valuable lessons from nine decades of a people-centered culture that consistently delivers outstanding customer service and reveals how you can develop a fully engaged, productive workforce. Treat your customers like partners Create a people-centered culture in a numbers-focused world Communicate your organization's vision Focus on strengths, not weaknesses Tie performance to the success of your mission Reduce your employee turnover Build communities connected by an emotional bond Ensure sustainability and growth-with an eye on the principles that allowed your success in the first place When you're built to serve, employees come to work because they want to, not just because they have to. "Built to Serve" is your hands-on guide to seeking this higher purpose."

Sprouts Farmers Market Adds Shawn Gensch and Dan Sanders to its Executive TeamWednesday, Jul. 8th, 2015by Melissa De LeonVolume :   Read   Speed Read  PHOENIX, AZ - Sprouts Farmers Market announced that it added two new members to its executive team; Shawn Gensch as the new Chief Marketing Officer and Dan Sanders as the new Executive VP of Store Operations.
“Shawn and Dan share deep retail leadership experience,” Doug Sanders, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sprouts, said in a press release. “With their marketing and operations expertise, Sprouts will continue to grow as a healthy grocery store offering fresh, natural and organic foods at great prices.”
Gensch, whose appointment was effective on June 29th, brings almost 25 years of marketing and finance experience. With executive roles in both the retail and financial services industries, inluding Target’s Senior VP of Marketing position and serving on the Board of Directors for GWG Holdings, Inc., he now will serve as a member of the Sprouts Executive Leadership Team.
“Never before have consumers had so many options when it comes to making decisions about where to shop for groceries and health needs,” Gensch said in the release. “Sprouts is uniquely positioned to join our guests on that journey, to share what we do and why we do it each and every day. Delivering value and variety for healthy living is paramount to the Sprouts brand and I am thrilled to be joining the team.”
Sanders, whose official start date was on July 6th, brings three years as Division President for SUPERVALU, where he led store operations across various divisions including Albertsons and ACME Markets. With a total of 25 years of supermarket operations experience, he has previously served on the Board of Directors of the Food Marketing Institute and the Western Association of Food Chains.
“I look forward to helping Sprouts sustain its unique approach to inspiring healthy living for all through this period of growth,” said Dan Sanders. “Sprouts puts customers first by providing the best value, service and experience every day and I am honored to join the organization.”
Sanders will report to Sprouts’ Chief Operating Officer, Jim Nielsen, and Gensch will report directly to Doug Sanders.
