Davis's screen acting debut was a dramatic role on the series Highway To Heaven as a 12-year-old college student prodigy. He began performing with various improv troupes. He worked with the short video website Channel 101.com and was in the Dan Harmon series Laser Fart. In addition, he played the role of David Lee Roth of Van Halen in an episode of Yacht Rock.
Soon after, he landed a recurring role on the improv series Whose Line Is It Anyway?. His comedic timing won over comedian Steve Martin and the other producers of The Downer Channel, earning Davis a spot in the cast of the comedy series in 2001. He has appeared in the television series The Norm Show, The Drew Carey Show and The Jamie Kennedy Experiment.
He appeared in the acclaimed telefilm Tuesdays With Morrie and was a series regular in Happy Family, opposite Christine Baranski and John Larroquette, in the fall of 2003. He played the role of an attorney in the October 9, 2008 episode of The Sarah Silverman Program. Davis regularly appears as a guest on the Superego podcast, where he has impersonated Sam Elliott.
Davis has toured on the "The Improv All Stars" alongside fellow Whose Line stars Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, Chip Esten, Brad Sherwood, Kathy Greenwood and Greg Proops.[2] Davis has been part of two USO tours and tours with Stiles, Esten and Proops doing live shows in various cities across the U.S. and Canada. He was often used in games that required improvisational singing and usually partnered with Wayne Brady on Whose Line and Esten on Drew Carey's Green Screen Show or live tours.
Davis was one of the rotating announcers on television's longest running game show, The Price Is Right, after Rich Fields's departure, until George Gray was chosen as the next permanent announcer.[3]
Since June 2012, Davis has co-hosted the live improvisational comedy podcast Harmontown with Community creator Dan Harmon, staged within Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles. Davis acts as "comptroller", serving as the show's anchor, announcer and sidekick[4] In 2014, Game Show Network announced he would host a game show called The Line. He is often confused with Jeff Davis, the creator of the television series Teen Wolf.[5]

His comedic timing won over comedian Steve Martin and the other producers of The Downer Channel, earning Davis a spot in the cast of the comedy series in 2001. He has appeared in the television series The Norm Show, The Drew Carey Show and The Jamie Kennedy Experiment.
He appeared in the acclaimed telefilm Tuesdays With Morrie and was a series regular in Happy Family, opposite Christine Baranski and John Larroquette, in the fall of 2003. He played the role of an attorney in the October 9, 2008 episode of The Sarah Silverman Program. Davis regularly appears as a guest on the Superego podcast, where he has impersonated Sam Elliott.
Davis has toured on the "The Improv All Stars" alongside fellow Whose Line stars Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, Chip Esten, Brad Sherwood, Kathy Greenwood and Greg Proops.[2] Davis has been part of two USO tours and tours with Stiles, Esten and Proops doing live shows in various cities across the U.S. and Canada. He was often used in games that required improvisational singing and usually partnered with Wayne Brady on Whose Line and Esten on Drew Carey's Green Screen Show or live tours.
Davis was one of the rotating announcers on television's longest running game show, The Price Is Right, after Rich Fields's departure, until George Gray was chosen as the next permanent announcer.[3]
Since June 2012, Davis has co-hosted the live improvisational comedy podcast Harmontown with Community creator Dan Harmon, staged within Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles. Davis acts as "comptroller", serving as the show's anchor, announcer and sidekick[4] In 2014, Game Show Network announced he would host a game show called The Line. He is often confused with Jeff Davis, the creator of the television series Teen Wolf.[5]

SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS.


                  He has a very sarcastic attitude but don't take it personal. He's a great professor. He teaches exactly what's on the test and his reviews reflect that. He speaks very quickly so if you have a hard time following get a recorder, take notes, and don't be afraid to ask questions. He teaches us what we need to know without the fluff! Aced every test!

LOTS OF HOMEWORK
PARTICIPATION MATTERS


                  Honestly, I'm awful at math so throughout high school I struggled and I was afraid I was going to fail. But for some reason, the way he teaches just clicks. He's very to the point and doesn't make things confusing. He literally writes out everything he talks about, you just really need to pay attention. Multiple choice test, easy A. Don't skip! :)

CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA


                  He goes over all the material really quickly, which might not be the best for someone who struggles with math. His reviews are exactly as the test and he goes over them right before each test. There is a lot of homework for 20% of the grade in MyMathLab, which can be done over and over to achieve a 100. Do what he asks and you will pass!

                  Amazing teacher!!! He is very thorough with the information he provides  and is very helpful if you are lost. His test reviews are the test, so make sure you complete them and you'll pass with flying colors. I have taken two of the courses he teaches and have enjoyed both classes.

                  Although he can be rude at times, he is very helpful and is very thorough. I learned a lot from him and he's pretty good at teaching. He's always there to help you if you ask him. His test are quite simple if you do the test reviews and projects he gives you. Good all in all.

                  He changed up the way that he teaches the classes this semester. I found it was very easy, though he wasn't very good at re-explaining. His lectures are fast as the wind, but he's very concise. He honestly just wants the students to pass. He uses MyMathLab.

CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA
TOUGH GRADER


                  Don't do it unless you have the time to spend endless hours in tutoring. He lectures as if he's in a race. Don't bother asking him to explain bc he won't. Nothing personal.

                  If you have a hard time with math DO NOT take him. He doesn't explain anything thoroughly, he teaches extremely fast paced with little room to ask questions. You basically have to teach yourself. Only good thing is his tests are exactly like his reviews, and are multiple choice.

                  The best math teacher ever! Hmwk is optional, gives bonus points, reviews are very clear. He won't be really friendly but he is extremely helpful and very clear on what he expects out of you. Do the reviews and you will get an A!

                  If you're not good at math don't take him. He's not friendly he's grumpy, doesn't use math lab or connect, few grades.

                  He was the best math teacher I have had in a while. Yeah he might look not so friendly and kind of mean, but I learned a lot and when I took my 0303 with another teacher, it made miss Mr. Davis.. His class was very easy. Just do the Homework and attend to class and most likely you will get an A. He even gives you extra points options. Take him!

                  Mr Davis is an awesome teacher. As long as you go to class and do the homework you will do well.  He isn't very friendly unless you do what he asks of you. If you come to class and do the work he will go out of the way to make sure you pass. I have taken 0302 3 other times and either failed or dropped. I received an A in this class.

                  Go to class, take notes, record the lectures if you can, do the homework. You will make an A. He isn't nice or easy so don't expect him to hold your hand. He gives extra credit for every exam if you do homework on the board. So take advantage of it.

                  Mr. Davis not a good professor. He is fast pace does not like you to ask questions and he corrects you if your wrong. He gives lots of homework and only test grades matter. He is not very helpful and basically you teach yourself! Do not take him!

                  DONT miss class. He is quick, and doesnt like to repeat himself. His reviews are the exact same as his test which makes the class easier. He is very very smart with man and the class was fairly easy. Drops the lowest test grade. Assigns homework with each lecture, not graded but gives extra credit points for your test. I would take him again!
