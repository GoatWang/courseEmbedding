The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Here’s just a small sample of the portfolios we offer to financial advisors


















 Global Signal (US and International)
The diversity of global equities and Invesco PowerShares® catalyzed by the SignalPoint™ algorithm.




 Universal Signal
A global oriented, balanced portfolio combining a broad range of equities and fixed income securities into a complete investment portfolio for a prudent investor.




 Stable Income
A higher yielding alternative to a money market for an investor with a longer time horizon and a willingness for a moderate level of risk.




 CU Income Composite
The CU Income Portfolio offers exposure to select higher quality fixed income ETFs of various maturities along with ETFs that cover real estate income trusts (REITs) and preferred and high yield securities, along with dynamic cash reserves.









Global Signal (US and International)
The Global Signal Portfolio offers exposure to a wide range of companies and non-correlated assets along with SignalPoint’s disciplined approach to managing risk. The result is a strategy that provides diversified exposure to the nine domestic industrial sectors, four international regions, non-correlated assets and dynamic cash reserves. The portfolio is then managed with SignalPoint’s disciplined process, which raises and lowers cash and ETF holdings incrementally in relation to market risk. Global Signal has the objective of long-term growth.




More Information

SignalPoint Asset Management, LLC (“SignalPoint”) is an SEC registered investment adviser. SignalPoint claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). A list of composite descriptions as well as additional information regarding policies for valuing portfolios, calculation performance and preparing compliant presentations are available upon request.
The Global Signal composite includes all similarly managed discretionary portfolios that invest in sector and geographic based equity ETFs with the goal of providing long-term capital appreciation from a well-diversified strategy. The Global Signal strategy allows for ETF based equity exposure with approximately 60% of invested assets providing exposure to the domestic markets and 40% of the invested assets providing exposure to the international markets. In addition, there will be limited exposure to ETFs that may hold non-correlated assets. Portfolios typically have 16 different ETF holdings in addition to cash reserves. Fully discretionary accounts are added to the composite on the first day of the month following the date of their full investment. Accounts are removed from the composite at the month end prior to their account change of status. The composites include taxable and nontaxable discretionary accounts with no restrictions and meet the minimum asset size requirement of $50,000 (as of August 1, 2008) for inclusion. The Global Signal Composite was created on October 1, 2008. Performance presented prior to October 1, 2008 occurred while the portfolio manager was affiliated with a prior firm. The portfolio manager had the primary and final responsibility at the prior firm for selecting the securities to buy and sell in the Global Signal composite strategy accounts. Valuations are computed and stated in US dollars. Performance shown represents total returns that include income, realized and unrealized gains and losses. Gross of Fee returns are presented before the deduction of management fees. The composite includes bundled fee portfolios that pay a fee based on a percentage of assets under management. This fee includes investment management, trading costs, portfolio monitoring, consulting services, and custody services. Gross returns for bundled fee portfolios are shown before the deduction of the entire bundled fee, and are shown as supplemental information. Gross returns for non-bundled fee portfolios have been reduced by transaction costs. Net of Fee performance returns are reduced by actual management fees and bundled fees for applicable portfolios. Internal dispersion is calculated using the asset-weighted standard deviation of all portfolios that were included in the composite for an entire year, net of fees. The 3-Year Standard Deviation represents the annualized standard deviation of actual composite and benchmark returns, using the rolling 36-months ended each year-end. Annual advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of assets under management according to the following schedule: 1.50% on the first $500,000 of assets under management; 1.25 % on assets between $500,000 – $2,000,000; 1.00 % on assets between $2,000,000 – $5,000,000; 0.75% on assets over $5,000,000, although fees may be negotiated or waived in certain circumstances. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
The Global Signal returns have been benchmarked to the MSCI World (Net) Index which captures large and mid cap representation across 24 Developed Market countries with 1,625 constituents. The index covers approximately 84% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each country, and is shown net of foreign withholding tax assumptions. MSCI, Inc. is the source and owner of the MSCI World Index data reflected in this material and all trademarks and copyrights related thereto. SignalPoint does not make any representation that the benchmark will or is likely to achieve returns similar to those shown in the performance results contained herein. Moreover the performance of a specific client account may vary substantially from the benchmark results contained herein based on the percentage of the client’s account allocated to one or more composite portfolios. Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will be profitable.
This material has been prepared for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer or solicitation to sell or buy securities in any specific company. Any such offer or solicitation will be made only by means of the SignalPoint offer of investment management services under written contract. None of the information or analyses presented is intended to form the basis for any investment decision and no specific recommendations are intended. Accordingly this material does not constitute investment advice, counsel or solicitation for investment in any security.
SignalPoint is an SEC registered investment advisor with its principal place of business in the State of Missouri. SignalPoint and its representatives are in compliance with the current registration and notice filing requirements imposed upon registered investment advisors by those states in which SignalPoint maintains clients. For additional information about SignalPoint, including fees and services, send for our disclosure statement as set forth on Form ADV using the contact information herein or refer to the Investment Advisor Public Disclosure web site (www.adviserinfo.sec.gov).

How SignalPoint™ Works
To put it simply, when your money is invested in a SignalPoint™ Portfolio, whenever the market moves, your money moves. The mathematical strategy calls the shots — incrementally and carefully capitalizing on both ups and downs in the market. It’s not influenced by anyone’s “gut feeling”, mass hysteria or the intuition of a portfolio manager. That’s why we can call SignalPoint a “nearly emotion-free investment model.”








Market Assessment Model
Our risk assessment process is composed of four variables, which the algorithm uses to constantly monitor sector (or sleeve, or component) risk, when to trim, when to add and where the cash level should be.
These four variables are:

Relative Valuation
Speculation
Divergence
IPO Zeal

A benefit pre-funding investment program designed exclusively for Credit Unions.


















 CU Yield Builder








Many credit unions are challenged with shrinking margins, the stabilization of reserve funding and higher operating expenses – in particular those that affect employee benefits.
CU Yield Builder™ is a powerful solution to battle the rising cost of employee benefits, which can have a meaningful impact on a Credit Union’s overall financial performance. CU Yield Builder™ was designed to help Credit Unions take advantage of NCUA regulation §701.19, which governs investment practices to offset current and future potential employee benefit obligations of federally chartered Credit Unions.
Benefit Pre-funding Program.
The NCUA offers Credit Unions the ability to invest in otherwise “impermissible investments” for the purposes of off-setting future employee benefit obligations.
Advantages include:

Provides Credit Unions with a new approach to potentially improve its bottom line by using some of its under utilized liquidity.
Simplified solution to manage and substantially reduce the expenses of ERISA defined benefits including: group healthcare, group disability, pensions and 401(k) costs, and other benefits.
Transforms employee benefits from a liability to a performing asset.
Experienced partners to provide advice, guidance and oversight to ensure the program meets the needs of your Credit Union and NCUA §701.19 requirements.






Proprietary Investment Strategies for Credit Unions
Access to the SignalPoint “CU Income Plus” portfolio that is cost effective, transparent, risk adverse and specifically tailored for Credit Unions. The primary objective of the CU Income Plus portfolio is to offer:

Broad fixed income sector diversification through use of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).
An above average current yield compared to money markets and certificates of deposit.
The potential for appreciation over a full market cycle.
Unique investment management process with a constant awareness of portfolio and market risk.

SignalPoint can also customize a portfolio for your Credit Union depending on objectives and time horizons.
Please contact us for more information.

How SignalPoint™ Works
To put it simply, when your money is invested in a SignalPoint™ Portfolio, whenever the market moves, your money moves. The mathematical strategy calls the shots — incrementally and carefully capitalizing on both ups and downs in the market. It’s not influenced by anyone’s “gut feeling”, mass hysteria or the intuition of a portfolio manager. That’s why we can call SignalPoint a “nearly emotion-free investment model.”








Market Assessment Model
Our risk assessment process is composed of four variables, which the algorithm uses to constantly monitor sector (or sleeve, or component) risk, when to trim, when to add and where the cash level should be.
These four variables are:

Relative Valuation
Speculation
Divergence
IPO Zeal
