James S. Huggins
Professional Biography

In addition to working with computer software for more than 30 years, James has the odd college degree (a BA in Mathematics), has produced cable television (about the first lunar landing), has appeared as a guest expert on television (for Y2K), has been a director of training and written and directed training videos, has developed a Computer-based Political Campaign Management System and consulted with several political campaigns, consulted on the Harvard University Alumni System, and been an international professional speaker, and has worked as a personnel recruiter, a quality specialist, a marketing coach, a ghost writer and editor, an ebook, book and manual design consultant, the voice on audio products and a search engine optimization professional. 

In the summer of 1969, while the USA was landing on the moon, James, and 5 other high school students, formed a television production company and talked their way into the Joint Industry Press Center at NASA (outside Houston). In addition to filming an onsite interview with Jules Bergman, ABC Science editor, James was in the press center at the moment of first lunar contact.
In the summer of 1970, between his Junior and Senior years in high school, James Huggins attended a National Science Foundation Summer Program. There he learned Fortran on an IBM 1620. 
Since that summer, for more than 30 years, he has worked continually with computer software, on machines including the IBM 1620, RCA Spectra 70, IBM 1130, System 34, 36, and 38, IBM 360, 370, and subsequent mainframes, the DEC 11/XX series and the VAX, the Hewlett Packard 3000 and 9000, and, of course, the PC, including

Huggins' Email Form Script - Testimonials
This page displays some of the generous testimonials I have received from users, who have granted me permission to display their testimonial on my 
		site. I thank each and every one of them.

September 29th 2013 05:32:55 AM Roy E. Klienwachter BC Canada Not used to this kind of good service! have 
		created more than a dozen website of my own and for clients. I am using other email scripts and have never been satisfied with how they work and the 
		lack of support. I chanced up James Script doing a search on Google. It was easy to install and partially worked. I notified James and his response was 
		immediate. The issue was cleared up right away. I am not used to this kind of support. He is a stickler for detail. Thank you James, I will be using 
		your script on my other sites as well. Namaste Roy Roy E. Klienwachter 
http://www.klienwachter.comSep.2013 
		

		[link 
		to my guestbook where the original testimonial is]Follow up notes:Resolution did take a while. I was eventually able to 
		convince his host that the issue was in their server configuration and, with much apology for mis-judging the error, they "added appropriate entries on 
		php.ini file" which corrected the hiccup along with a couple related problems as yet undiscovered by me or Roy. The entire episode took about 40 minutes 
		of online chat, but it is now fixed and if the error crops up again, I'll know better how to help out.   JSH

Dear James S. Huggins,I just wanted to take the time to thank you so very much for your Huggins Email Form Script.
		This product is very well designed, easy to use and works! Being the only IT person with the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners when it came 
		time to rebuild our website I knew I needed something easy to maintain and that would work. When I found your product I just couldnt believe that it 
		was free. I have over 10 forms on our website that uses your Email Form Script and I never have to worry about them. The setup was so easy that 
		I was even able to spend a little time performing some extra styling to the forms. The forms have helped save time with staff since they no 
		longer have to email back in forth to obtain missing information and it allows us to respond to request faster. When I did contact you with 
		questions I could not believe how fast youresponded and how willing you were to help. If you are looking for an Email Form Script LOOK NO 
		FURTHER!!! Thank you for providing this wonderful product and support. You have mademy life so much easier.Here are a few of the 
		forms from our website:http://www.albme.org/obsregis.html

I was having a problem finding an e-mail Form Script that wasnt difficult to use or understand.After reading about 
		Huggins' Free e-mail Form Script on Cheryl Wises Expression Web Forum I went to his Web Site and downloaded the Script Files along with the User Manual 
		which is quite extensive.Well to keep it short I was able to modify the Scripts and load them to my Web Site after relocating the Site to a 
		Hosting Service that supported pure PHP. This was done through the outstanding support from James Huggins. He went far beyond what I 
		expected from a tech support point of view. His concern with my problem was genuine and his guidance in getting the script on the new Hosting Service 
		was greatly appreciated.If you are looking for an e-mail Form Script to use you cannot get a better one than Huggins' Free e-mail Form Script 
		and the best Tech Support I ever received.I cannot say thank you enough for James assistance.I have used the form on
		ElizabethFilHolm.com and am in the process of placing it on my other Web SitesRon 
		Childs, Real Time Marketing Inc.RJLInfo.comMar.2013 

I have once before written a testimonial thanking James for all the hard work he has done to help many other other people and also in 
sharing his time and knowledge to enable many people to use his excellent work for free. Since I last wrote I have had to contact James once again due 
to me wanting to modify my contact form. It is because of this I feel compelled to write once again thanking James and 'singing his praises'! From my initial 
contact James once again replied within the hour and he has patiently stuck with me for around 4 days while I rectified my problem.When I cannot do 
something I want to know the reason why and rather than James just rectifying the problem he has walked me through each step while giving me guidance, which 
meant that I needed to study the code and ultimately learn what it all meant. If I got stuck and could not go any further he would then explain what I needed to 
do. I can not thank him enough for his patience, knowledge and help. If you genuinely want a form that works and does what it says then you definately 
have to use the Huggins Script. His manual may not be to everyone's taste but it is nowhere near as daunting as it first looks. To get a basic form working is 
very very easy and with James's support no one could ask for anything more. Once again, thank you James.Charles Archer, Director

The Huggins Email Form Script is an amazingly easy solution for very flexible and customizable PHP contact forms. As soon as my team and 
I took a look at it, we were sold  except ITS FREE!! We are not PHP developers and dont intend to be PHP experts any time soon. This extremely well written 
and flexible script has kept us out of the business of having to do that. Whats more, we were very happily surprised to find out that, not only does James 
fully support his product, but he is dedicated to helping folks make sure that it works for them. We received replies for information within minutesfantastic 
customer service!! 
Lane GiffordBoldLinesServCorp.com May.2012 

JHuggins' Email Scriptworks like a charm! It appears to be 'bulky' until you understand that only a few tweaks make it work for 
you. The Script is easy to implement - just read the instructions . But like all instructions, it's best if the designer of them were right there 
guiding you, and here is where the support is fantastic. If you need help, you can easily get friendly patient assistance by phone and/or email 
personally from James.
Because of this I recommend trying his brilliantly written free script; brilliant because of the checks and cross checks it 
automatically does so that when you get email, it's legitimate and cross checked for malicious code. 
Thanks James for all your help.

Hi James, 
I want to thank you for your Email Form Script and sharing 
your expertise with the world. Im a complete novice where building websites is 
concerned and am still in the throes of coming to grips with Microsoft 
expression. It was on the expression forums that I discovered the existence of 
the Huggins Email Form Script when I needed to set up a secure email form for a 
website that Im developing. Thats when the fun started. 
I must admit I found your documentation a little daunting 
at first, until I stopped skimming and started to follow the structure and 
logic of what you were trying to present in your manual.  Its comprehensive, 
its clear and unambiguous, and it lead me carefully through the building 
process. It all fell into place nicely and I surprised myself at how quickly I 
was able to have a working email form set up, tested and running.  
Now heres the biggest surprise of all. When I struck a 
problem that I wasnt able to resolve, on the verge of abandoning the Huggins 
solution I decided to contact you on the off chance you might respond. I was 
delighted and grateful to receive a level of support from you that was prompt, 
effective, and personal. Indeed, as a senior manager in the high end computer 
industry for many years in Australia, I have rarely come across such enthusiasm 
and commitment to getting a clients problem resolved in the quickest possible 
time...and you dont even know me! 
Thank you again, James. The Huggins Email Form Script is 
a great product thats professionally supported and easy to implement. Needless to say Ill be using it again in future projects, and of course I will 
ensure I dont miss an opportunity to recommend it to anyone with whom the 
subject of secure web forms is raised.

Here's what I told my Dreamweaver Class, and anyone that will listen. I also use the form for our Curling Club's Contact page. And club members love it!
You'll find really good tools to make forms in Dreamweaver. You'll find excellent extensions too. You can even find terrific wizards or form generators on-line, like Accessify's quick form builder.
But, none of them tell you how to implement the form without incurring a lot of spam, how to make the form secure, and make it actually work to deliver to you usable and understandable information. Most importantly it's the connection you need between you 
and your clients.
Except for Huggins' Free e-mail Form Script!
At first, the contents in the Huggins' Form Mail folder look's intimidating and hard to install, but it isn't at all. Just read the "manual" and follow the instructions. If you have a problem and you contact James, he will respond and help you find the 
answer you need! Fantastic! Search no further!
Here's two examples of a simple contact form:uofgts.com/dream/contact.html

Hello James, 
Like some others, I found your script through Google. To be honest, I was kinda wary of it because of previous failures with properly 
setting up an email form. After some trial and failure, finally got the hang of it and it worked like a charm ever since. What impressed me so much out of the 
learning process is your documentation. The amount of information it packed has helped me enormously to understand how the script and its setting work. I most 
definitely recommend it to others.

James, 
I want to thank you for all your help and time. I am new to designing and the guy I host with said that if I ever want to be a Web Master 
I would need to know the information located at your sight. After checking it out and getting all the necessary documents I was a bit overwhelmed and 
confused; when I contacted you I was amazed at the customer service you provide. Mine is not a small or simple form by any means and I am just awestruck at the 
time and effort you put forth on this for someone you don't even know. If you would like to use the site as an example of what can be done with this Form Script 
please feel free - http://www.jarheadtop.com/orderform.htm.

James, 
I want to thank you for your continuing work on the form 
script. 
Like many others, I was left somewhat adrift when 
FrontPage extensions began disappearing from servers. Having switched to 
Expression Web, I knew that I could continue on a limited basis on selected 
servers, but needed to locate a more permanent solution. Of interest, perhaps, 
is that I found your script listed along with several others on Microsoft's 
expression discussion forum. 
Naturally, I investigated all of the listed scripts along 
with several others that I located independently. And none of them come close to 
the Huggins' Email Form Script: 
1. The customizations available to developers are 
absolutely superior. 
2. The documentation with the script is not only complete and comprehensive, but 
also well written. 
3. The personal support that you provide when questions do arise is prompt, 
specific, and very helpful. 
In short, this is an absolutely superior package. I am 
proud to be a client and happy to provide the reference to others. 
Thank you again for your hard work.

NB: this testimonial comes from Bob Walto who discovered a 
problem and communicated it to me.
Thank you so much for your very prompt attention to this 
and for resolving it so quickly. I was pretty darn sure that it was an error on 
my part, but it was a very pleasant experience to review this error with you and 
determine the error was in the script. You have done an excellent job of 
delivering a very useful script, and your commitment to delivering quality is 
very much evident in the service you provide.

Hi James, 
I  now have all three of my web site forms converted 
to your email script. The other two were easy for me to do after getting the 
first one up and running. I am a happy camper. 

Attached is a "formal" thank you. I sincerely thank you. Your script is 
exactly what I needed and what thousands of other FrontPage users are looking 
for no doubt. The fact that I do not write code and could actually get your 
script up and running on my web site says a lot about your script. It is truly 
wonderful. Your documentation and online example and form tutorial made it all 
understandable. 
Here are the links for my three forms: 


www.dixonpubliclibrary.org/illrequest.html 

www.dixonpubliclibrary.org/illarticlerequest.html and you already saw:

www.dixonpubliclibrary.org/askalibrarian.html  
Our library usually receives requests from 2 of the 3 
forms every day. I am the Interlibrary Loan librarian and I am happy to say that 
I rarely get requests via the article request form since this is not the type of 
stuff our patrons are usually looking for - but it's there for people that might 
need it and is used occasionally. But the other two forms get lots of use. 
Thanks again.

Hi Jim
I successfully implemented your .PHP e-mail Form Script on several of my Web Sites and it works great. 
I use 1&1 Web Hosting and they suddenly abandoned Front Page Forms and I am not a programmer. Therefore I was hung out to dry big time.

Your PHP Script saved my *ss. 
Anyway, do you accept $ compensation/gratuities? If so, I'll send you a few bucks if you tell me where to send the check.

When I received word from our 
host that they were phasing out support of FrontPage extensions I switched to 
Expression Web. I tried EW's Form Wizard but as rumored I too found it to be 
lacking, so I began looking for a third party form script. 
We have 15 FrontPage-created 
webs with various types of mail forms, tutorial feedback, surveys, registration 
forms, and questionnaires. 
I tried the Tectite email form 
but discovered that they "guide" one to a paying subscription by not answering 
questions on their forum once they have you hooked. Then I tried James' script 
and what a difference the over all experience has been. 
What I appreciate most, beside 
the fact that it caters to script/coding semi-illiterates like myself, (it's 
virtually copy-paste) is that I have the experience that James is committed to 
service. I marvel at his immediate implementations of edit suggestions, it makes 
me feel like I'm part of his project.

I was looking for a simple mailscript, found your 
massive script, got impressed and now as a result I use your script for a very 
tiny little email form. And I find myself reading the huge manual (which i 
normally avoid at all cost) just for fun.   ;) Good work!

James, 




Thanks for creating the Email Form Scriptv 2.0.1. 




I was told about it by Ernie Secrest, who hosts my 
sites. 




It is fantastic, and the [manual] is well-written 
and very helpful. 




I just completed implementing your script on a 
site, and will definitely be using it on others (except for the one on GoDaddy, 
which I found disallows the php mail function). 




I have a link back to your site so others will find 
out about it, too.

Dear James, 




I am writing to say how much I appreciate your 
e-mail form script. 




When I decided to set up a site for my husband, I 
had no idea what HTML code was, thought that CSS and SEO might be acronyms for 
certain illnesses and fell in to despair when I realized that I would need to 
put an e-mail form on the contact page. In short, I was a complete and total 
novice. 




I do not know what I would have done without your 
script. It is simple to use, but when my lack of experience led me to make 
stupid mistakes you very patiently helped me to understand what I needed to do 
to install the form. 




I have been very happy with the form and very, very 
grateful for your support. You have truly helped us to set up a site that works. 
My husband is an artist and, in a few short months, the form has been the bearer 
of commissions, two exhibitions in London and Portugal and virtually no spam at 
all. 




I would have no hesitation in recommending your 
script to anyone, no matter what their level of experience or expertise. If I 
can install and use it, anyone can. 




Thank you again for your kindness in providing the 
script and for your thorough and patient support.

Mr. Huggins,  

I have been looking for a program or script that would handle the 
		forms I put on my web sites, and I have tried quite a few with some limited success, but mostly 
		problems causing wasted time, energy, and money. Your Huggins Email Form Script is simply 

the best 
		script I have found. My only problem is that I did not find it in 1994 or 95 when I first started 
		doing my site.  

Of course Microsofts Front Page with their extensions would 
		handle  some of what your script does, but I have tried to move away from that monopoly and do the 
		coding myself. The only reason I used Front Page was the fact that they could handle a rather 
		simple form. Now that I have found your script, I am completely free to do as I want, and your program 
		puts very little limitations on what I can only dream about incorporating in any of my forms. 
 

Thank you so much for this script. It really is the 
answer I have been looking for 12 years or so.

For several reasons, I resolved to move away from requiring 
the FrontPage Server extensions on my site. One of the things that had been 
locking me to the FPSe, however, was the inability to find a reasonably secure 
and easy-to-use replacement for the email form handler. HEFS proved to be the 
solution to my needs, and, while I still use FrontPage to manage my site, I have 
managed to eliminate any need for the FPSe, and can now use reputable hosting 
services that I had to disregard previously because of the lack of FPSe support. 
Thanks for this!

Dear James,  
I am using your Email Form Scripton every one of my sites and 
a site I manage for a commercial furniture stores. I use the script for both a 
contact form on all sites and as a family group sheet on my genealogy site. I 
even use it on one of my sites that does not support PHP by referring to the 
script on another of my sites. The script works just as advertised and you have 
provided great documentation and tech support. It also works well to use it as 
an include to insert where needed and I can tell exactly which page the form 
came from.  
I appreciate the fact that you continue to work to improve the 
form and quickly fix any bugs that are found. I do not hesitate to recommend 
your Email Form Scriptto anyone who needs to provide forms on their site.  
Thanks you for all you do for us.

James, 




I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you and your program. I had been posting in several forums my issue with getting a form mail program to work. You stepped forward and offered yours for FRee but better than that, you were willing to hand-hold me thru the whole process of getting it installed, set up and working. You took hours to help me, talking with my hosting tech support to try to resolve problems and going the extra mile to help me. You have been there after "normal" business hours to work with me to get my clients a reliable way of processing the forms they need for their websites. 




I can not thank you enough...words are not enough. I will sing your praises and point people to you at every opportunity.

Read the documentation yesterday and 
		find it very easy to implement. Besides hiding the email address, I 
		especially like the ability to send the email to more than one address. 
		This could allow me to send to an alternate Gmail account  where I 
		can automatically archive all the messages.

		He may be a Windows guru, but he lives with the spirit of Open

I have been looking for a form in PHP

		When I heard about James' form I was really happy. Not only does it work 
		as advertised, knowing James, I knew that any bug, would be instantly 
		looked at, that he would strive to improve it, and not only that, make 
		it do things normally one would have to pay thousands for. I've 
		recommended James' form to many others and use it on all new sites, and 
		will change over each of my sites as I get time. I cannot recommend his 
		form highly enough. I can only hope that James continues with this 
		enterprise for a long time to come. I intend to encourage him all the 
		way.
