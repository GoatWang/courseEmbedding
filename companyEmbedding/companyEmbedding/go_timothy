Premium Timothy Grab & Go® Compressed Bale


Premium Timothy Grab & Go® Compressed Bales are formed by allowing Standlee Premium Western Forage® to grow to the proper stage of maturity, cutting the plants, allowing them to sun-cure (dry) to an acceptable moisture level and baling the forage at the optimal time. Standlee Premium Western Forage® creates Grab & Go® compressed bales of forage from a large 4’x4’x8’ bale that is put through a press, sliced horizontally, pushed onto a scale, weighed, compressed, banded and then shrink-wrapped. Timothy Grass forage is highly palatable, is low to moderate in protein and high in digestible fiber.

Feeding Instructions
On average most horses comfortably consume 2% of their body weight in dry forage per day.  This equates to 20 lbs of dry forage per day for a
        1000 lb horse.  
Standlee recommends that you weigh the amount of forage provided to each horse to ensure you are feeding the proper amount.  This is especially
        important with baled and compressed forage since similar volumes of forage (a flake for example) vary in weight.  Standlee also recommends
        cutting the bands on compressed bales and allowing the bale to expand overnight to avoid overfeeding.  Feed Standlee Premium Western Baled
        or Standlee Premium Western Compressed Forage at a minimum rate of 1.5% of body weight. Gradually increase or decrease the amount of forage to
        maintain desired body condition.   
Never feed moldy or insect infested forage to horses.  
Always provide free-access to fresh, clean water.  
If you have questions, please contact the nutritionists at Standlee Premium Western Forage®, or consult with your veterinarian.
Feeding Instructions for other animals.

Product Description


Standlee Premium Timothy Grab Go 50 lb. Compressed Bale  In Store Purchase Only   Premium Timothy Compressed Bales are formed by allowing Standlee Premium Western Forage® to grow to the proper stage of maturity, cutting the plants, allowing them to sun-cure (dry) to an acceptable moisture level and baling the forage at the optimal time. Standlee Premium Western Forage® creates compressed bales of forage from a large 4’x4’x8’ bale that is put through a press, sliced horizontally, pushed onto a scale, weighed, compressed and then banded. Timothy Grass forage is highly palatable, is low to moderate in protein and high in digestible fiber. Recommended For:  Growing (slow to moderate growth), mature and overweight horses, horses with HYPP, performance horses, early pregnancy mares and breeding stallions.  Other Product Benefits   Natural forage length mimics grazing Slow intake, stimulates chewing and minimizes digestive upset Convenient to handle and store Physical form allows visual inspection of quality and consistency  Guaranteed Analysis     Crude Protein - Min 8%   Crude Fat - Min 1.5%   Crude Fiber - Max 35%   Moisture - Max 12%    Ingredients  Naturally Sun-Cured Premium Western Timothy Grass Forage Feeding Instructions  On average most horses comfortably consume 2% of their body weight in dry forage per day.  This equates to 20 lbs of dry forage per day for a 1000 lb horse.   Standlee recommends that you weigh the amount of forage provided to each horse to ensure you are feeding the proper amount.  This is especially important with baled and compressed forage since similar volumes of forage (a flake for example) vary in weight.  Standlee also recommends cutting the bands on compressed bales and allowing the bale to expand overnight to avoid overfeeding.  Feed Standlee Premium Western Baled or Standlee Premium Western Compressed Forage at a minimum rate of 1.5% of body weight. Gradually increase or decrease the amount of forage to maintain desired body condition.   Never feed moldy or insect infested forage to horses.  Always provide free-access to fresh, clean water.

Premium Timothy Grab & Go Compressed Bales are formed by allowing Standlee Premium Western Forage to grow to the proper stage of maturity, cutting the plants, allowing them to sun-cure (dry) to an acceptable moisture level and baling the forage at the optimal time. Standlee Premium Western Forage creates Grab & Go compressed bales of forage from a large 4 ft. x 4 ft. x 8 ft. bale that is put through a press, sliced horizontally, pushed onto a scale, weighed, compressed, banded and then shrink-wrapped. Timothy Grass forage is highly palatable, is low to moderate in protein and high in digestible fiber.Ingredients:Timothy grass hay sun-cured.Feeding Directions:On average most horses comfortably consume 2% of their body weight in dry forage per day. This equates to 20 lb. of dry forage per day for a 1,000 lb. horse. Standlee recommends that you weigh the amount of forage provided to each horse to ensure you are feeding the proper amount. This is especially important with baled and compressed forage since similar volumes of forage (a flake for example) vary in weight. Standlee also recommends you cut the bands on compressed bales and allow the bale to expand overnight to avoid overfeeding. Feed Standlee Premium Western Baled or Standlee Premium Western Compressed Forage at a minimum rate of 1.5% of body weight. Gradually increase or decrease the amount of forage to maintain desired body condition. Never feed moldy or insect infested forage to horses. Always provide free-access to fresh, clean water. If you have questions, please contact the nutritionists at Standlee Premium Western Forage, or consult with your veterinarian.

        Fresh smell
Purchased this bale for my rabbits and they love it, fresh smelling hay, smells like sunshine in a bag, I underestimated the amount if hay they packed into this bale! Buns will have hay for months!

        Good price but very dusty and lots of rocks.
I normally feed my rabbits oxbow but wanted to try this because of cost. The bunnies seem to like it just fine but there are a lit of rocks in the hay and it is super dusty. It wouldn't be an issue except my rabbits are in the house. I can't keep up with the dust from this not to mention them breathing it. For outside rabbits, it would be a good deal.

        Bunny and hoomin friendly!!
It is SO easy to manage and maintain! I am not the biggest girl, so it being compact I can move it without getting anyone else's help!! Then I just cut one bail wrap, pull out a nice chunk, and wrap it back up in a thick trash bag! The bunnies LOVE IT!! More than the tiny little "bunny" store bags that cost the same for a weeks worth of hay. This last me a couple months!!! It's so great!!! I forgot I had one at my moms house and when I came home 6 months later, it was still good!!! I love it, the bunnies love, it's a win!

        Not great!
I bought this about 2-3 weeks ago. It is very dusty and there's a lot of dirt in there. It's not very green. Not too happy about my purchase. The guinea pigs don't like it as much as the Oxbow hay. I know some people who bought this were pleased, but unfortunately I didn't get so lucky. Maybe it was a bad batch.

            How many pounds is this?
        


Asked by: Stevie123

            Standlee Premium Western Forage Timothy Grab &amp; Go bales weigh approximately 50lbs.
            Answered by: Standlee® Product Expert
Date published: 2017-06-14




            Is it long stems or short?
        


Asked by: four way farm

            Premium Timothy Grab &amp; Go&reg; Compressed Bales are formed by allowing Standlee Premium Western Forage&reg; to grow to the proper stage of maturity, cutting the plants, allowing them to sun-cure (dry) to an acceptable moisture level and baling the forage at the optimal time. The stem size should be that of a regular bale of hay, however it all depends upon the growing season as to the stem size of the product.

            Is this good for a rabbit?
        


Asked by: cpaul

            Thank you for your question.  We do not recommend that you purchase the compressed bales at the retail store as they are graded for livestock &amp; not small animals. Thank you

            Is this first, second, or third cut?
        


Asked by: Erinfff

            This product is packaged after the second cut.
            Answered by: SamW
Date published: 2016-08-29




            What is the total NSC (sugar/starch) of the Standlee Timothy Grass Forage?
        


Asked by: Dakota88

            We do not test each batch as it is made, we test our fields, we are required by law to guarantee protein, fat, fiber and moisture, we are not required to guarantee non-structured carbs (WSC &amp; Starch).  We can provide you with a 5-year average of what the NSC levels are of the Timothy Pellets.  All values are based on &ldquo;As Fed Basis&rdquo;.  The estimated levels of NSC for the Standlee Timothy Pellets are 12%.

            Once purchased how long can it be safely stored?&nbsp;
        


Asked by: Monique

            Standlee recommends that if the Grab and Go bales are being stored for a period of time that the bags either be removed from the product or that there are several slits cut in the plastic to help prevent condensation which will lead to mold growth.  Standlee Western Forage&rsquo;s products are a non-perishable item.  With that being said, as long as the products are in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place out of the effects of the weather there is really no expiration date.
            Answered by: Standlee® Product Expert
Date published: 2017-07-06




            So, in the Details, it says YES for Rabbits but, your answer here is &quot;No&quot; ... Is there a way to get the proper answer?
        


Asked by: BobS43

            Standlee Premium Western Forage does not recommend that you purchase the Compressed or Grab and Go bales for your small animals, as they are graded for livestock. Standlee Premium Western Forage has a small animal line; in which we recommend feeding these products to small animals.

INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:   CLMT) ("Calumet" or "the Partnership") a leading independent producer of specialty hydrocarbon and fuels products, announced today that its general partner's Board of Directors has named energy industry veteran Timothy ("Tim") Go as the Partnership's incoming Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2016.  Mr. Go, 48, joins Calumet with more than 25 years of experience serving in executive-level roles at leading companies operating in the petroleum refining and specialty products markets.  As CEO, Mr. Go will lead and execute Calumet's long-term strategy to become the premier global producer and distributor of specialty petroleum products.
Mr. Go joins Calumet from Flint Hills Resources, L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc., where he most recently served as Vice President, Operations.  Previously, Mr. Go spent nearly 20 years in various senior level operations and management roles at ExxonMobil Corporation.  As a trained chemical engineer, Mr. Go brings a deep base of technical and operational knowledge to Calumet.  In recent years, Mr. Go led the integration of Flint Hills Resources' $2 billion acquisition of PetroLogistics' propane dehydrogenation plant; managed the operations of multiple specialty chemical plants; and established centers of operational excellence for Flint Hills Resources.  Earlier in his career, Mr. Go managed ExxonMobil's 187,000 barrels-per-day Strathcona refinery in Edmonton, Canada, while also serving in a variety of operations, crude logistics and strategic planning roles for ExxonMobil in the Gulf Coast and around the world.  
Bill Hatch will remain Interim CEO of Calumet until December 31, 2015.  At the conclusion of his term as Interim CEO, Mr. Hatch has agreed to remain with Calumet as an Executive Advisor to the Partnership.  In this newly created role, Mr. Hatch will assist Calumet in broad-based efforts to streamline business processes and improve operational efficiencies throughout the organization.
"Following a comprehensive search process, our Board of Directors has unanimously selected Tim Go to be the next CEO of Calumet," stated Fred Fehsenfeld, Jr., Chairman of the Board.  "Tim's decades of experience as a senior refining executive, coupled with his significant technical knowledge of the markets in which we operate, position him for long-term success in this pivotal role.  We are extraordinarily pleased to welcome Tim to the Calumet family."
"On behalf of our Board of Directors, we want to thank Bill Hatch for his ongoing commitment to Calumet and look forward to leveraging his knowledge and expertise in his new role as Executive Advisor to the Partnership, once his tenure as Interim CEO concludes," added Fehsenfeld.
"Having served as Calumet's CEO for nearly 25 years, I believe Tim is the right person to lead Calumet as we transition into this next phase of growth, guided by a strategy that seeks to focus our collective energies toward becoming the premier global producer of specialty petroleum products," stated Bill Grube, Executive Vice Chairman of Calumet.  
"Calumet is a dominant player in the specialty petroleum products industry, having earned the admiration and respect of its competitors, customers and investors through an unwavering commitment to operational excellence, product quality and profitable growth," stated Tim Go, incoming CEO of Calumet.  "I am honored by the opportunity to lead Calumet alongside a deep bench of talented executives who remain committed to growing the reach of our specialty products business on a global scale, while adhering to core values that have served to define Calumet for the last quarter century."
