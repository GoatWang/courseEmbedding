Early life and education[edit]
Born in Portland, Indiana, Meeker holds a B.A. in psychology from DePauw University (1981) and an M.B.A. in finance from Cornell University (1986).[4]
Career[edit]
In 1982, Meeker joined Merrill Lynch as a stockbroker. After graduate school, she began as an analyst covering the technology sector at Salomon Brothers in 1986.[5] She worked for Cowen from 1990-1991 before moving to Morgan Stanley to specialize in covering the personal computer and consumer software industries.[6]
In August 1995, Morgan Stanley served as lead manager for the initial public offering of Netscape Communications. Later that year, Meeker and Chris DePuy at Morgan Stanley, published The Internet Report, a landmark Morgan Stanley industry report which became known as "the bible" for investors in the Dot com boom [7] and went into popular circulation — as a book, and on the web. Over the years, Morgan Stanley published similar landmark reports led by Meeker on online advertising, e-commerce, evolution of search, the Internet in China, and the mobile Internet.
Meeker was vilified in the press as one of a number of star analysts who were questioned in fraud investigations after the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000 to 2002.[8] Meeker was not charged with any wrongdoing. Morgan Stanley and nine other investment firms were compelled to participate in a global legal settlement.
In August 2004, Morgan Stanley (with Meeker as research analyst) served as lead manager for the initial public offering of Google.[9] Meeker was characterized by Andrew Serwer in Fortune magazine in 2006 as "absolutely first rate when it comes to spotting big-picture trends before they come into focus. She gathers massive amounts of data and assembles it into voluminous reports that, while sometimes rambling and overambitious, are stuffed with a million jumping-off points."[10] Meeker is often credited for her comprehensive, rapid fire, annual Internet industry overviews at the Web 2.0 conferences in San Francisco each autumn.
During Morgan Stanley's tumultuous period in April 2005 when CEO Phil Purcell's management decisions were being intensely scrutinized, Meeker, along with colleagues Steve Roach, Byron Wien, and Henry McVey, wrote a letter to then co-presidents Zoe Cruz and Steve Crawford that expressed their concerns about the damage to the culture of the firm.[11] The letter served as an important catalyst in increasing the focus of the board of directors on the depth of challenges facing Morgan Stanley at the time. In June 2005, John Mack was named CEO of Morgan Stanley, replacing Phil Purcell. A copy of the letter is included in Patricia Beard's book Blue Blood and Mutiny: The Fight for the Soul of Morgan Stanley published by HarperCollins, 2007. Meeker was named "one of the ten smartest people in tech" by Fortune magazine in 2010.[12]
In December 2010 Meeker left her position as a managing director at Morgan Stanley and head of the bank's global technology research team to become a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, where she has participated in over 20 different deals. Meeker serves on the boards of electronic signature provider DocuSign[13], mobile payments company Square[14], and Peer-to-peer lending company Lending Club.[15]
In February 2011, Meeker created and compiled 'USA Inc.,' a non-partisan report that looked at the U.S. government (and its financials) from a business perspective. Successful stocks Meeker championed early on included Dell, Microsoft, Intuit, Netscape, AOL, Amazon.com, Yahoo!, eBay and Google. Failed picks included AOL after its takeover of Time Warner, Excite@Home, and drugstore.com.
Meeker was one of the witnesses in the Ellen Pao gender discrimination lawsuit.[16] In 2014, she was listed as the 77th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[3]

 USA Inc. is a non-partisan report that looks at the U.S. federal government (and its financials) as if it were a business. Investor and Analyst, Mary Meeker, authored the report with the goal of informing the discussion about our financial situation and outlook. USA Inc. examines the country’s income statement and balance sheet, aiming to interpret the underlying data and facts, and illustrate patterns and trends in easy-to-understand ways. The report also analyzes the drivers of federal revenue and the history of expense growth, and discusses basic scenarios for how revenue and expense growth might change to help America move toward positive cash flow.

This Powerpoint-book conveys information visually.  Long term trends jump at you immediately.  I hope this is an emerging trend among nonfiction authors.More specifically, this book conveys excellent information regarding the rising costs of Social Entitlements (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security) and health care costs. Medicare and Medicaid are the main causes why USA Inc incurs rising yearly Budget Deficits and has a negative net worth of $44 trillions.  Social entitlements will consume 50% of the Federal Budget by 2018 (slide 250), 100% of the Federal Budget by 2080 (slide 270) and 100% by 2025 when adding net interest expenses (slide 441).  The related health care costs are rising due to an aging population, expensive technology, and rising utilization.The choice of corrective actions (increase in taxes and reduction in benefits) to render Social Security sustainable are modest (slide 255-265); but, the ones to shore up Medicare are draconian (slide 271-278).  End of life care is exorbitant as last year of life accounts for 28% of all Medicare spending (slide 286).  Returning Medicare and Medicaid to long term solvency will prove challenging.  Reducing reimbursement rates to health care providers is tough since hospitals already incur net losses of - 9% of revenues for Medicare patients and - 12% for Medicaid ones (slide 300).  Hospitals make up those losses by cost shifting to privately insured patients where they make up staggering profit margins of + 32%. This is one of the main causes of the health care crisis associated with skyrocketing insurance premium, employers dropping insurance coverage benefits, and a rising uninsured population.The international health care cost comparison (slide 108-113 and 316) demonstrates how our pre-health care reform system was egregiously more expensive and less effective than any other major OECD country.  We pay a lot more, and get less health than anyone else.  There is no doubt the system should be reformed.  We also bear responsibility for our health care costs as our rate of obesity has skyrocketed since 1990 (see map of the US slide 288). Costs related to obesity amount to 7% of overall healthcare costs.The study of the drivers of the Fiscal Budget (222 - 234 and 356 - 359, 368): GDP growth on the tax receipt side and government policy and demographic changes on the spending side is insightful.  Also, the benchmarking of growth rates in various tax receipts and government spending is interesting.  You can see how entitlement expenses growing at 6% p.a. over the past 40 years at twice the GDP rate have swamped everything else.  Our increase in consumer spending from 62% of GDP to 71% of GDP since 1980 was driven by health care spending (slide 405).  Health care and housing spending have nearly doubled as a % of GDP since 1965 (slide 406).  And rising unfunded entitlements are often a long term driver of debt crisis for many countries (slide 423).  See the fate of the PIGS countries on this count (slide 427).  All those trends calls for a restructuring of our social entitlement programs.Within the section on Defense Spending (63 - 70), Meeker reveals that Defense spending is clearly not a fiscal issue.  As a % of GDP such costs are historically moderate at only 5% of GDP.The visual explanation of the housing bubble (183 - 186) is excellent.  You can see the negative correlation between the U.S. Personal Savings Rate and the U.S. Homeownership Rate.  Something was clearly wrong.  The related section of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (195-199) and the potential ultimate cost to taxpayers is also excellent.We also have an education crisis.  Even though education spending has risen from 3.7% to 6% of GDP since 1960, our performance ranking among OECD countries has plummeted.For the not so good stuff, there are a few arithmetic mistakes.  Slide 107 describes who pays for health care (48% Government, 32% private insurers, 12% individuals).  That adds up to 92%.  It should add to a 100%.  Slide 29 should be taken out.  It attempts to teach one the difference between a trillion and a billion.  It suggests a trillion is 217 times a billion (instead it is 1,000).  On slide 364, hours work per week can't possibly have decreased by 0.22% per year since 1970, yet have remained constant at 39 to 40 hours.Additionally, comparing Government Spending to a company's finance as Meeker does has limitations.  In her language, any net loss and any debt is bad.  But, in Government Finance those concepts are not so meaningful.  Instead, the key benchmark is whether the Debt/GDP ratio is sustainable. Let's say a country wants to maintain a moderate Debt/GDP ratio of 50% and has a long term real GDP growth of 2.5% and an inflation rate of 2.5%.  This implies a sustainable Budget Deficit of: 50%(2.5% + 2.5%) = 2.5% of GDP.  In other words, such a country could run Budget Deficits at 2.5% of GDP forever and its Debt/GDP ratio would remain stable at 50%.  This sustainable leverage framework is absent from the book.  Instead, Meeker asks (slide 233) how can we shore up this "business" so it can break even or generate a profit within this decade.  On the next slide, she suggests that running net losses (Budget Deficits) always boost the Debt/GDP ratio.  As clarified, those statements are either incorrect or raise the wrong issue.Another weakness of the book is to make very long dated historical comparisons that are irrelevant.  A graph on page Xi shows that from 1790 to 1930 Federal Government Spending averaged only 3% of GDP.  But, any fiscal history prior to the early 1970s when Medicare and Medicaid were fully operational is not relevant.  It conveys a misleading message that in former centuries our Federal Government was run more efficiently at only 3% of GDP vs 24% now.  But, there is a huge difference between having no government (3% of GDP is pretty much that) and an efficient government (probably around 20% of GDP).All in all, this still makes for a great reference.  If you are interested in the subject, I also strongly recommend the The Coming Generational Storm: What You Need to Know about America's Economic Future.Read more33 comments|

Mary N. Meeker

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Mary Nacol Meeker, Ed.D. (1921–2003), was an American educational psychologist and entrepreneur. She is best known for her applying J. P. Guilford's Structure of Intellect theory of human intelligence to the field of education.
Meeker was born in Louisiana and grew up there and in Texas. She attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. Meeker subsequently moved to California and began graduate studies in educational psychology at the University of Southern California, where she studied with J. P. Guilford, whose work would be central to her career. Meeker earned a Master of Science, a Master of Education and, in 1971, a Ph.D. in Education from USC.

SI and SOI[edit]
Meeker's doctoral dissertation focused on applying Guilford's Structure of Intellect theory ("SI") to creating assessments and curriculum materials for use in teaching children and adults. The premise of SI is that intelligence comprises many underlying mental abilities or factors, organized along three dimensions—Operations (e.g., comprehension), Content (e.g., semantic), and Products (e.g., relations).[1] In this three-dimensional model, each intersection of the three dimensions represents as a unique intellectual ability, such as comprehension of semantic relations; that is, understanding analogies.
During Meeker's studies, she saw the potential of applying SI in the field of education, based on a twofold premise: 1) intelligence can be precisely measured using a test that identifies an individual's aptitude on the multiple intellectual abilities identified in the Structure of Intellect model; and 2) the individual's intellectual abilities can be remediated or improved using learning materials that target each particular ability. Meeker called her application of Guilford's theory "SOI."
SOI testing[edit]
SOI assessment materials, including the SOI Learning Abilities (or "SOI-LA") test instrument,[2] measure intelligence corresponding to those intellectual abilities from Guilford's SI model that Meeker determined to be most closely correlated to educational and professional success. (She excluded other SI abilities from SOI due to their perceived difficulty of assessment or their lack of correlation to educational requirements.) After she normed and validated the SOI-LA instrument in the late 1970s and early 1980s, she began producing tests and corresponding remedial materials for school districts and private clinics. In many states, the SOI-LA is accepted for screening students for admission into gifted and special education school programs, and worldwide, SOI-LA is used in private clinics.
SOI training[edit]
SOI learning materials are useful in addressing learning disabilities in early childhood education. Basic school tasks such as reading or arithmetic are actually complex tasks that require application of multiple underlying abilities. Because children who fail at these classroom tasks often lack the underlying abilities to succeed at them, attempts to teach those children to perform such tasks are not successful. Some children who cannot read may lack the underlying intellectual ability to associate a word (i.e., a series of graphical figures) with its meaning (i.e., a semantic unit); and some children who cannot perform arithmetic may lack the underlying intellectual ability to associate a digit (a numeric unit) with its meaning (a symbolic unit). SOI training can remediate these underlying intellectual abilities to enable mastery of reading and arithmetic.
The SOI model is designed to address learning disabilities in stages. An SOI test assesses the individual's underlying intellectual abilities, including the constituent abilities enabling performance of the targeted task. Then, after the individual's SOI profile is compared against the intellectual abilities that enable the targeted task (such as reading or arithmetic), specific intellectual abilities are identified for remediation. Finally, SOI curriculum materials train the identified abilities so that, after the abilities are remediated, the individual may learn to perform the more complex task.[3][4][5]
The SOI model can be useful in assessing learning styles, because the SOI-LA test includes separate measures of visual and auditory learning abilities. SOI has been related to the multiple intelligences theory promulgated by Howard Gardner.
Later work[edit]
In 1975, Meeker and her husband, Robert Meeker, opened the SOI Institute, a business producing SOI tests and educational materials and conducting training for educators and related research. During the 1980s and 1990s, Meeker developed a wide reputation in the field of educational psychology, and continued to run the SOI Institute.[6] During this time, Meeker was engaged as a consultant for the state departments of education in California, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.
In the 1990s, Meeker worked extensively with Bridges Learning Systems,[7] a commercial enterprise founded by former U.S. Senator William E. Brock to implement school programs based on Meeker's SOI work and on the Integrated Practice Protocol (IPP) she developed with her husband, Robert Meeker. IPP comprises SOI-related assessments and learning and teaching materials that incorporate intelligence assessment (such as with the SOI-LA test), vision assessment, and sensory integration assessment. For example, some children who cannot read may lack the underlying ability to visually distinguish one alphabetical character from another. This perceptual (visual) aspect of SOI illustrates the extensions of SOI application made in IPP by Meeker and Meeker.
In later life, Mary Meeker devoted herself semi-professionally to watercolor painting, winning a variety of local prizes.[8] Her subjects of choice were florals and landscapes.
Mary Meeker died in 2003, survived by her husband, her three daughters, and two grandchildren. Her husband, Robert Meeker, continues her work via the operation of SOI Systems in Springfield, Oregon.

Meeker's doctoral dissertation focused on applying Guilford's Structure of Intellect theory ("SI") to creating assessments and curriculum materials for use in teaching children and adults. The premise of SI is that intelligence comprises many underlying mental abilities or factors, organized along three dimensions—Operations (e.g., comprehension), Content (e.g., semantic), and Products (e.g., relations).[1] In this three-dimensional model, each intersection of the three dimensions represents as a unique intellectual ability, such as comprehension of semantic relations; that is, understanding analogies.
During Meeker's studies, she saw the potential of applying SI in the field of education, based on a twofold premise: 1) intelligence can be precisely measured using a test that identifies an individual's aptitude on the multiple intellectual abilities identified in the Structure of Intellect model; and 2) the individual's intellectual abilities can be remediated or improved using learning materials that target each particular ability.

Mary N. Meeker

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Mary Nacol Meeker, Ed.D. (1921–2003), was an American educational psychologist and entrepreneur. She is best known for her applying J. P. Guilford's Structure of Intellect theory of human intelligence to the field of education.
Meeker was born in Louisiana and grew up there and in Texas. She attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. Meeker subsequently moved to California and began graduate studies in educational psychology at the University of Southern California, where she studied with J. P. Guilford, whose work would be central to her career. Meeker earned a Master of Science, a Master of Education and, in 1971, a Ph.D. in Education from USC.

SI and SOI[edit]
Meeker's doctoral dissertation focused on applying Guilford's Structure of Intellect theory ("SI") to creating assessments and curriculum materials for use in teaching children and adults. The premise of SI is that intelligence comprises many underlying mental abilities or factors, organized along three dimensions—Operations (e.g., comprehension), Content (e.g., semantic), and Products (e.g., relations).[1] In this three-dimensional model, each intersection of the three dimensions represents as a unique intellectual ability, such as comprehension of semantic relations; that is, understanding analogies.
During Meeker's studies, she saw the potential of applying SI in the field of education, based on a twofold premise: 1) intelligence can be precisely measured using a test that identifies an individual's aptitude on the multiple intellectual abilities identified in the Structure of Intellect model; and 2) the individual's intellectual abilities can be remediated or improved using learning materials that target each particular ability. Meeker called her application of Guilford's theory "SOI."
SOI testing[edit]
SOI assessment materials, including the SOI Learning Abilities (or "SOI-LA") test instrument,[2] measure intelligence corresponding to those intellectual abilities from Guilford's SI model that Meeker determined to be most closely correlated to educational and professional success. (She excluded other SI abilities from SOI due to their perceived difficulty of assessment or their lack of correlation to educational requirements.) After she normed and validated the SOI-LA instrument in the late 1970s and early 1980s, she began producing tests and corresponding remedial materials for school districts and private clinics. In many states, the SOI-LA is accepted for screening students for admission into gifted and special education school programs, and worldwide, SOI-LA is used in private clinics.
SOI training[edit]
SOI learning materials are useful in addressing learning disabilities in early childhood education. Basic school tasks such as reading or arithmetic are actually complex tasks that require application of multiple underlying abilities. Because children who fail at these classroom tasks often lack the underlying abilities to succeed at them, attempts to teach those children to perform such tasks are not successful. Some children who cannot read may lack the underlying intellectual ability to associate a word (i.e., a series of graphical figures) with its meaning (i.e., a semantic unit); and some children who cannot perform arithmetic may lack the underlying intellectual ability to associate a digit (a numeric unit) with its meaning (a symbolic unit). SOI training can remediate these underlying intellectual abilities to enable mastery of reading and arithmetic.
The SOI model is designed to address learning disabilities in stages. An SOI test assesses the individual's underlying intellectual abilities, including the constituent abilities enabling performance of the targeted task. Then, after the individual's SOI profile is compared against the intellectual abilities that enable the targeted task (such as reading or arithmetic), specific intellectual abilities are identified for remediation. Finally, SOI curriculum materials train the identified abilities so that, after the abilities are remediated, the individual may learn to perform the more complex task.[3][4][5]
The SOI model can be useful in assessing learning styles, because the SOI-LA test includes separate measures of visual and auditory learning abilities. SOI has been related to the multiple intelligences theory promulgated by Howard Gardner.
Later work[edit]
In 1975, Meeker and her husband, Robert Meeker, opened the SOI Institute, a business producing SOI tests and educational materials and conducting training for educators and related research. During the 1980s and 1990s, Meeker developed a wide reputation in the field of educational psychology, and continued to run the SOI Institute.[6] During this time, Meeker was engaged as a consultant for the state departments of education in California, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.
In the 1990s, Meeker worked extensively with Bridges Learning Systems,[7] a commercial enterprise founded by former U.S. Senator William E. Brock to implement school programs based on Meeker's SOI work and on the Integrated Practice Protocol (IPP) she developed with her husband, Robert Meeker. IPP comprises SOI-related assessments and learning and teaching materials that incorporate intelligence assessment (such as with the SOI-LA test), vision assessment, and sensory integration assessment. For example, some children who cannot read may lack the underlying ability to visually distinguish one alphabetical character from another. This perceptual (visual) aspect of SOI illustrates the extensions of SOI application made in IPP by Meeker and Meeker.
In later life, Mary Meeker devoted herself semi-professionally to watercolor painting, winning a variety of local prizes.[8] Her subjects of choice were florals and landscapes.
Mary Meeker died in 2003, survived by her husband, her three daughters, and two grandchildren. Her husband, Robert Meeker, continues her work via the operation of SOI Systems in Springfield, Oregon.

              Published on May 31, 2016






                    The 2016 edition of Mary Meeker's annual Internet Trends report covers today's Internet growth and an in-depth look at the following: •      Global Internet users have surpassed 3B; India has supplanted the US as the world’s second-largest Internet market.•      Internet user growth remains consistent (led by acceleration in India), while smartphone user and shipment growth have slowed.•      In the face of a slowing global economy, key macro growth drivers from the past 2 decades are less certain.•      Internet advertising (particularly via mobile) continues to grow, but so does ad-blocking, pushing the envelope on development of more innovative ad formats.•      New online-first brands have rapidly grown in popularity for the millennial generation with their focus on omni-channel and personalized distribution strategies.•      In communication, video and images shared are growing as a means of storytelling; creators, consumers, and advertisers are taking part.•      Messaging has evolved from simple, expressive conversation to business-focused use cases, with Asian platforms often leading the way.•      More efficient and often more convenient than typing, voice-based interfaces are ramping quickly and creating a new paradigm for human-computer interaction.•      Transportation is being re-imagined, as the rise of car computerization, autonomous driving, and sharing transform our understanding of mobility.•      Looking to China, Internet leadership continues, as the country boasts global innovation powerhouses in e-commerce, messaging, travel, financial services, and on-demand transportation.•      The proliferation of data generated by a multitude of devices has fostered tremendous business opportunity, but privacy concerns abound.

                              When i heard he turned $10 into $10,000 in 2 months, i could not believe it's possible. I thought it might be a bug, but word on the street is that it's real. If it is, then we might be in for a real treat! I'll stay on the case and let you know more as soon as I speak with the developers, anyway i will go for it since they have a 60 day money back guarantee, so if not quiet like Jordan told us i will ask for a refund. In the meanwhile, check out the video i told you about last week: http://bit.ly/jordantopaulvideo

    PAGE 150 Global Perspective on Auto Industry Future – By Region, per Morgan Stanley Auto & Shared Mobility Research Source: ‘Global Investment Implication of Auto 2.0,’ Morgan Stanley Research, 4/19/16, led by Adam Jonas N. America – Some home field advantage on tech innovation & early application of shared mobility, but culture of private ownership and litigious USA judicial system may slow progress. China – Government focus on technology / environment, as well as quality of ride-sharing companies (esp. Didi), have driven strong early sharing adoption. Competing investment in public transit and impact of car ownership on social standing may impede full-scale adoption. India – Offers all key ingredients (rapid urbanization, limited public infrastructure, large millennial population, internet inflection point) for shared mobility leadership. Current market structure is likely to change as shared mobility gains dominance, so future remains unclear. Europe – Lack of homegrown tech champions coupled with power of OEMs (particularly Germans) and quality of European public transit may make adoption more difficult. High fuel costs and strong emissions standards may drive movement forward. Japan – Social implications of an aging population and policy support (given importance of a strong automotive industry) represent key advantages, but OEM buy-in to new paradigm is crucial, and R&D investment in tech arena lags somewhat behind other geographies. Korea – Strong technological culture, early political support and sharing-focused younger demographic leaves Korea relatively well positioned for move to shared mobility, though adoption remains in its infancy.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

USA Inc. examines the country’s income statement and balance sheet, aiming to interpret the underlying data and facts, and illustrate patterns and trends in easy-to-understand ways.

Online Extra: Resume: Mary G. Meeker - Bloomberg




























































  
















Online Extra: Resume: Mary G. Meeker



April 30, 2001, 12:00 AM EDT








 Mary G. Meeker
Born September, 1959, Portland, Ind.
Where She Got Her Type-A Personality: She credits her father. "My dad was intense and competitive, and he [would] drive you crazy," she says. He was a golf nut who built his own fairway and green in the family's backyard -- and pressured Mary to become a golf prodigy. She became captain of the golf team at Jay County High School, practicing at 5:30 a.m.








Education: A BA in psychology from DePauw University in 1981, an MBA in finance from Cornell University in 1986
Career Highlights: Started in 1982 as a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch in Chicago. After grad school in 1986, became a research analyst at Solomon Brothers. Switched to SG Cowen from 1990 to 1991. Moved to Morgan Stanley in 1991, where she covered PCs and then the Net. Now a managing director.
How She Got Internet Fever: Read a newspaper story in late 1994 about Netscape Communications. She believed the Net would change every industry, so she became the chief cheerleader for upstarts such as Yahoo!, Excite, and Priceline.com.




Why She Loves Upstarts: She was a fan of Indiana high school basketball. At the time, there were no divisions, so little schools played big schools, and any one of them could become the state champ. "It was like Silicon Valley," she says. "The little guys would go up against the big guys -- and sometimes they'd win."
What Drives Her Today: "I want to make up for the year 2000," she says. "It was a bad year [for me] as a stock picker, and a bad year as an analyst."




Family: Single. Claims she has no time for a social life. Returns to Indiana frequently to visit her elderly parents, Gordon, 90, and Mary, 86. Fishes and skis with her brother, Dick, who is 21 years older, and his family, in Aspen, Colo. 




Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
