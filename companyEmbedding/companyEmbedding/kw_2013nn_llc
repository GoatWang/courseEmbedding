Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NN (NASDAQ:NNBR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $33.50 (21.16% upside)

However, there are some things you should know if you want to make your software purchase a successful one. Here, we will guide you through all those basic things and help you to make an informed decision.
Things You Should Know When Purchasing a Software
Always check the compatibility and system requirement of the software you are purchasing. Most of the well-known software makers will mention the required operating system, graphic requirements and memory requirements in their system requirement info. If you don’t know much about your current system, you can check it by going to System Properties by right click on My Computer and select Properties. For tablets and smartphones, you don’t have to worry about such these if you are buying it from its official app store.
Another good idea is to look for some user reviews and expert reviews on that software. It will be easy to make sure whether the software is safe to use and legitimate or not if you find lots of expert reviews on that software. If you are purchasing the software via download, make sure it’s not too big and your internet connection is good enough to handle that download. Some software like antivirus offers a specific number of PC license that can be used on a specific number of PC only.
