XProtect® LPRLicense plate recognition
Recognize the power of automatic vehicle identification.




XProtect® LPR is license plate recognition software that reads license plate information from vehicles and links the license plate information with video. As a fully integrated part of the XProtect® Smart Client, XProtect LPR has a wide set of application areas, including access control, theft prevention, loyalty programs, toll road and border control. Advanced matching logic makes it possible to compare recognized number plates with pre-defined lists and initiate automated actions, such as opening a gate, thus increasing work productivity.
XProtect LPR is an XProtect add-on product that is seamlessly supported by most XProtect video management software products and Milestone Husky™ NVR units. It has optimized recognition algorithms for more than 100 countries and states around the world.



XProtect LPR key benefits

XProtect LPR offers a number of powerful applications for security-conscious environments:
Prevent losses Are customers driving away without paying for fuel?
XProtect LPR is an ideal solution for gasoline chains. Using negative lists and third-party integrations, the system can automatically close a gasoline pump if a blacklisted vehicle license plate is recognized at any station in the chain.



Manage parking Is this car covered by a parking subscription?
XProtect LPR can help you reduce the costs and time associated with managing parking subscriptions. Instead of issuing toll collection devices or radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to authorized personnel, XProtect LPR can automatically open a parking lot gate when a permitted license plate is identified.
Regulate accessShould this vehicle be granted access?
Use XProtect LPR to optimize your processes by automatically controlling access to protected areas and premises. The software’s flexible, user-defined match lists make it easy to add license plates belonging to visitors, temporary personnel and delivery vehicles. Once the pre-defined license plates are identified, vehicles are automatically granted access.
Gather evidenceWhere was the car in question?
XProtect LPR can be a powerful tool for law enforcement agencies needing to track the movements of a suspicious vehicle. Each time a vehicle passes by a camera equipped with XProtect LPR, it is registered in the system. Using XProtect LPR’s reporting functionality, law enforcement officials can create a report showing all of the movements of a particular vehicle within a specified timeframe. The report includes a video thumbnail of the recognized vehicle, a close-up of the license plate and details about the detection time.

At Milestone Investment Counsel, we take pride in providing our private wealth clients with what we sincerely believe is the best offering of disciplined portfolio management, value and personalized service in the industry. Consider our record:  






In 1996, Milestone led the industry as one of the first investment firms in Canada to bring the benefits of low-cost indexing to private clients. The vast majority of firms in North America now offer exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or other indexing options. 




We were among the first and remain one of the few investment counsellors in Canada authorized by U.S.-based Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) to use its highly respected, proprietary investments to further enhance performance for our clients. 




Our management fees are among the lowest in the Canadian industry. Since Milestone accepts no sales commissions, trailer fees or any other additional charges, we never have any conflicts of interest with our clients.






A truly personalized approach requires individually invested accounts to be managed on a discretionary basis, with day-to-day portfolio management delegated to highly qualified investment counsellors. We are among the less than 10% of financial advisors in Canada who are registered to offer this sophisticated level of service.
Through our expertise, value and care, we earn the trust and confidence of our clients – and the privilege to support them on their life journey. Thanks in large part to referrals by satisfied clients, Milestone today manages more than $300 million in assets on behalf of 220 individuals and their families. To learn more about what distinguishes us from our peers, we invite you to browse our site or contact us for a portfolio review.




















                We earn the trust and confidence of our clients -
