David and Linda Evans wanted to be closer to their children and grandchildren in the Richmond area, so two years ago they sold their home in New Kent County and moved into a rental in West Broad Village in western Henrico County.Since then, they have been searching for a home to buy. They recently decided on GreenGate, a 70-acre mixed-use development under construction about 2.5 miles west of where the Evanses live in the Short Pump area of western Henrico County.They aren’t moving far, and the couple like what GreenGate has to offer.The development, which is under construction, is touted as offering the look, feel and vibe of Richmond’s distinctive urban neighborhoods like the Fan and the Museum districts, but in a suburban setting designed with such amenities as shopping and restaurants just steps away.“We heard about GreenGate and decided that was the environment we wanted to be in,” said David Evans, who is retired.“We love being able to walk to things,” Linda Evans said. “This is what we are looking for. They will have a Starbucks with a wine bar and a Mellow Mushroom (pizza restaurant). Then they will have medical office buildings, so you can walk to your doctor’s office. Across the street is Wegmans (grocery store). It’s like the perfect location.”That type of enthusiasm is gratifying to James B. Gurley Jr., a principal with Markel|Eagle Partners LLC, which is developing GreenGate. Markel|Eagle Partners is a real estate investment company jointly owned by the Markel Ventures subsidiary of specialty insurer Markel Corp. and principals of the Eagle Cos.The partnership’s other developments have included West Broad Village, a once-struggling mixed-use development that Markel|Eagle Partners LLC took over in 2009 and turned around.Gurley is banking on the appeal of GreenGate to be as popular.Despite the talk of millennials opting for downtown urban living, suburbia remains the housing choice for most people living in the 50 largest metropolitan areas, according to an analysis by the Washington-based Urban Land Institute, a land use think-tank. The institute examines housing trends in a report published last month titled “Housing in the Evolving American Suburb.”Markel Eagle Partners purchased the GreenGate land in 2013, paying $8.5 million for two tracts — 68.9 acres from the Oscar N. Nuckols Family Trust and nearly 6 acres from Sheila and Hugh A. Worcester.Markel Eagle later sold 3.65 acres on the western edge of the site to Chester-based Shamin Hotels, which is planning to build a 126-room Hampton Inn & Suites hotel on the acreage. Construction is slated to start later this year on that project.***The GreenGate development will have 100,000 square feet of retail space, anchored by a 36,000-square-foot Lidl grocery store and about a half-dozen restaurants.Construction on the Lidl store is well underway as the European grocery chain prepares for its aggressive expansion into the U.S. The chain has not made any individual store announcements or set opening dates, but plans to have the first U.S. stores open no later than 2018, said Lidl US spokesman Will Harwood.The other retail in GreenGate will be housed in seven architecturally distinct buildings.Restaurants include West Coast Provisions and The Daily Kitchen & Bar, two concepts from Richmond Restaurant Group, which owns East Coast Provisions in Carytown. The group owns area restaurants including The Hard Shell, The Hill Café and Pearl Raw Bar.Another restaurant in GreenGate will be Red Salt Chophouse and Sushi restaurant from EAT Restaurant Partners, which operates seven restaurants in the Richmond area including Fat Dragon, Foo Dog and Wild Ginger.Those eateries will join Mellow Mushroom pizzeria and Starbucks as tenants in GreenGate.James Ren Mefford, director of operations for EAT Restaurant Partners, said they hope to open Red Salt in early June. In addition to indoor seating, the restaurant will have a heated patio, plus a large room to host private events.“When we saw the scope of this development, there were two things that we really liked,” Mefford said. “We like the mixed-use with large residential area behind it. That makes it sort of self-feeding. Then obviously that area is really hot out there.”The other attraction was the emphasis on local retailers, Mefford said.Tenants for the retail space include Carytown Bicycle Co., CycleBar indoor exercise cycling studio and Polished Nail Salon.In addition, two 45,000-square-foot, three-story medical office buildings will be constructed at the rear of the commercial space. Gurley said he hopes to announce a tenant of one of the buildings soon.“We are hard at work on the spaces that we’ve leased, building them out,” Gurley said last week.“Several of the tenants are expected to begin construction of their building interiors in the next couple of weeks. ... Mellow Mushroom is pretty far along and building out their space. We’re over 70 percent pre-leased on the retail, and all of that will open in the spring.”***At the rear of the development will be the residential component consisting of 230 town homes and single-family homes priced from $400,000 to $800,000.Architectural renderings of the development show tree-lined streets, buildings with distinct ornamental features like those you might find on century-old structures in the Fan, patios for outdoor dining, plus mini-parks and sidewalks for strolling.“What really drove us was there’s so much that makes Richmond a unique place, a special place,” Gurley said. “There’s a ton of history. The architecture is really special. If you go to the Bottom or the Fan or Monument Avenue, the homes along there, the warehouses and the older office buildings, there is a real history here.”At GreenGate, “We set about trying to define a development with character,” Gurley said. “To do that and to do that with a level of authenticity, we sought some help. Burt Pinnock of Baskervill (architects) has kind of been my partner from the beginning on what the commercial should look like, how it should feel, what kind of place we are going to create.”Pinnock said the design team looked for inspiration in the neighborhoods of Richmond.“Our offices are located here in Shockoe Bottom,” said Pinnock, referring to Baskervill. “So that is what we looked to, and that is what we took our inspiration from when we started.”They also looked at Carytown, noting the architecture but also “the idea of scale and relationship of sidewalk to building, building to people and so forth. We kind of collected all of that imagery into our collective libraries and that is what we drew off of to create some of the things we did at GreenGate,” Pinnock said.GreenGate is still a work in progress, but the shells of buildings are up. On a recent tour, Gurley pointed out features that illustrate their efforts to provide a unique sense of place.For instance, the building that will house the Starbucks has distinctive brick work around the windows and exterior of the buildings.Pinnock described the features. “The Starbucks building was inspired by some of the ideas of our older industrial buildings — the gabled roof, the stepped parapets, but also the brick patterning, and the recessed areas of the façade,” Pinnock said.Pinnock said his favorite of the buildings is the one that will house Richmond Restaurant Group’s The Daily.“It’s reminiscent of the iron fronts that are on Main Street just about five blocks from my office. Those kinds of things are what inspired us, and I hope we are successful in pulling it off,” Pinnock said.***
The attention being paid to the look of GreenGate also is being paid to the retail tenant mix, said Harrison Hall of Divaris Real Estate Inc. Hall and Peter Vick, also of Divaris, are handling the retail commercial leases. Chris Rice and Kyle Burns of NAI Eagle are handling office space leases.Unleased spaces include 7,800 square feet at the other end of the building that houses the Starbucks. The developer purposefully is being selective about tenants that will complement the concept.“We have a very well-known national retailer we are negotiating with” for that space, Hall said.There is probably one space left that could accommodate a full-service, sit-down restaurant, he said.“We are in talks with another well-known fantastic local restaurant tenant for that one remaining space and hopefully will have something to announce in the coming weeks,” Hall said.Rents are in line with the rest of the market, he said.“We feel like we offer a distinct price point and a very different experience and a type of center that truly does not exist in Short Pump other than at GreenGate,” Hall said.***Gurley was exuberant last week as he walked around the development.“The idea is that it’s a vibrant place that feels alive,” Gurley said.In addition to the architectural touches, there will be artistic touches — murals on the sides of some of the buildings.Local artist Ed Trask is leading that effort, Gurley said. Even the big utility company transformer boxes will get attention. The idea as of now is to have a weekend painting/art party event in the spring when the retailers are open, Gurley said.Ad Vice Studios LLC of Mechanicsville is the contractor doing the big monument signs on Broad Street that will carry the development’s name and tenant list.As of last week, a dozen homes in the development had been sold, according to a leasing agent.In addition to the Evanses, Ted and Carrie Theisen are among the first buyers. The Theisens plan to relocate from Northern Virginia and move to GreenGate this summer. Their youngest son is graduating from high school in June and will be off to college, so it’s a good time to move, Carrie Theisen said. She and her husband work at companies that have offices in the Richmond area.They have decided on the development’s largest town home, the 4,300-square-foot Boulevard model. All the models except one include an elevator.Neighborhood walkability was an important factor, Theisen said. That, plus the reputation of Eagle builders and the Wegmans grocery store across Broad Street, sealed the deal for them, she said.“Having a community where we could walk to both restaurants and grocery stores is really, really important to us,” Theisen said.“The way that the community is set up ... they have some green space that is separating the retail area from the living space was really attractive to us. ... We looked at several developments,” she said. But GreenGate “was the one that really appealed to us the most.”
