NORTH LAS VEGAS, NV, Jun 14, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- NORTH LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - Jun 14, 2017) - Renewable Energy and Power, Inc.

                                         a diversified corporation with markets in energy-saving technologies of LED lighting, solar and wind energy, is pleased to announce it has contracted with a large contract electronic assembly corporation in the San Francisco Bay area to retrofit with LED lighting both the indoor and outdoor facilities of the corporation's main campus.  The initial LED retrofit will be indoor, for both the office and production areas of the facility, with the outdoor areas of the campus to follow.  "LED lighting brings down energy costs directly with more efficient energy usage over outmoded technologies, and additionally, by constantly improving LED products with more advanced chip designs," points out CEO Donald MacIntyre. "These newer LEDs produce the same light intensity at lower wattage, lessening energy costs to customers even further over the life of the lighting. Renewable Energy and Power constantly researches the design and output of the chips being used in the product it provides, giving our customers the most advanced designs for the greatest possible savings on their energy bills. Additionally, the newest chips also produce the most satisfying lighting."  Renewable Energy and Power, Inc.'s extensive engineering background in both the design and manufacture of power supplies (fixtures), and associated thermal management (bulbs) gives the company an almost unique ability to investigate the engineering qualities of its LED lighting products to maximize customer satisfaction.  The Company website, www.reappower.com, illustrates the important services and products Renewable Energy and Power, Inc. (REAP) provides to the Green Energy market to make it competitive with fossil fuels by employing proprietary new technologies in combination with existing solar and wind-power electric generation and LED lighting. REAP functions in both domestic and international markets that are in vigorous growth stages with long-term prospects. Federal and state legislation in the United States, including many tax incentives, are driving businesses and consumers to replace older technologies with the new solar and LED alternatives offered by REAP.  Safe Harbor Act: Forward-Looking Statements are included within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements regarding our expected future financial position, results of operations, cash flows, financing plans, business strategy, products and services, competitive positions, growth opportunities, plans and objectives of management for future operations, including words such as "anticipate," "if," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "could," "should," "will," and other similar expressions are forward-looking statements and involve risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance, or achievements. We are under no obligation to (and expressly disclaim any such obligation to) update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Consulting for Green Building & Energy Solutions in California by Rick's Energy Solutions
























































 























Office: 707.578.5380
Mobile: 707.529.2570
Rick@rc-networks.com
























Green Energy Building Consultations & Energy SolutionsAs of 7/21/2017
Our new address will be
1421 Guerneville Rd. Suite 106
Santa Rosa, CA 95403
At Rick’s Energy Solutions, we are among the nation’s top green building consultants, and a leading name in energy conservation. Based in Santa Rosa, California, we service the city and surrounding areas, focusing heavily on homeowners, architects and home designers. If you are in need of a home energy audit or if you own a company in Northern California, looking for consulting and energy solutions, we are here to meet your needs.
 
About Our Services
 
Rick’s Energy Solutions consists of multi-skilled experts who have 40 years of experience in the construction industry. We are certified energy plan examiners, certified energy analysts, certified green building professionals, certified GreenPoint raters, certified home energy rating system raters (HERS raters) and certified CALGreen special inspectors. We can even help with the preparation and submission of required documentation for California Title 24 energy conservation and Green Building submissions. We are passionate about green energy solutions and we know the business inside and out.
 
At Rick’s Energy Solutions, we assist homeowners in making their living spaces more energy efficient and eco-friendly. It all begins by understanding the home as a comprehensive system and understanding how well your household performs through a home energy audit. This involves evaluating your home for its green building environmental impacts and its carbon footprint. Most houses do not operate to their fullest energy potential, even if the houses are newly constructed. Many homes leak air conditioning during the summer and heat during the winter due to faulty vent installation, windows with poor retention and myriad other reasons.
 
Finding Issues and Improving Efficiency
 
A lot of lighting and appliances utilize more energy than needed to function. This is incredibly wasteful, but very difficult to detect. Many air ducts leak, which wastes heated and cooled air. In addition, many water fixtures are wasteful, using more water than necessary for typical applications. These are all aspects our HERS raters look for in your home, during our audit. We identify hidden issues and offer solutions to help your home consume less energy and resources without requiring you to make any lifestyle changes. These solutions include duct redesign, air sealing, lighting and appliance upgrades, window upgrade, faucet and water fixture replacement and more. All energy problems in your home can be met by our efficient energy solutions.
 
Our services are very important when it comes to architects, designers and contractors. These people are responsible for the construction of future homes and commercial buildings and renovations of existing structures. When we work with them in helping to shape their next projects, you can rest assured that we are setting a new energy-smart status quo for buildings to come.
 
One Team Providing Smart Energy Solutions
 
It is very much a team effort. When working with architects, it is our job to prepare the documentation required for obtaining the Energy Star rating on new homes. The architects are the ones who bring the eco-friendly visions to life. We also prepare the documentation required to submit to the IRS for tax rebates for energy conservation measures. At Rick’s Energy Solutions, we make sure that designers, contractors and architects are up to par with the best knowledge, techniques and technologies when it comes to energy efficiency. It is our way of nipping energy problems in the bud. We consult on such projects as home additions, remodeling jobs and the construction of entirely new homes and commercial buildings to ensure the highest quality of environmental friendliness.
 
When it comes to energy solutions in Santa Rosa California and the surrounding areas, including Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake, Marin and Napa counties, Rick’s Energy Solutions is the most efficient and affordable option. We have more than 40 years of experience in the construction industry, with 25 of those years working in building inspection and plans examination. Our team is equipped to handle any project from all angles imaginable. We have our finger on the pulse of what is needed in terms of the most up-to-date energy-efficient conservation techniques and know the logistics that are involved with making everything come together effectively.
 
We also work closely with architects, contractors and homeowners. We could not do what we do without their skills and cooperation. There is no other green building consultant or energy conservation construction company that has all of their bases covered the way we do. The best defense is a good offense.
 
Get Started on Becoming More Energy Efficient Today
 
Rick’s Energy Solutions is privileged to be doing such important work that affects both our futures and yours alike. If you are a homeowner, a home designer, an architect or a contractor, we would love nothing more than to give you an evaluation of your home or planned project. Our consultation service can help you identify improvements that can be made at your home to help protect the environment and even shape the future of how buildings are constructed.
 
We offer both home and commercial energy audits, and are certified by the California Association of Building Energy Consultants (CABEC), Build It Green, Efficiency First, the International Code Council (ICC) and CalCERTs. We could not be prouder of our company’s past successes, and we are laser focused on the horizon of energy conservation.
 
As energy conservation and green building consultants, we’re standing by to assist homeowners, contractors and designers alike in identifying home energy solutions, preparing and submitting California Title 24 energy conservation and Green Building compliance documents, recommending small changes to improve efficiency and much more. Contact us today by calling 707-578-5380 and lets work to create a better, more energy-efficient tomorrow!
