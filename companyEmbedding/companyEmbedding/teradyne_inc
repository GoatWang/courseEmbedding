FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]




Nick DeWolf, Teradyne co-founder, 1959


Teradyne was founded by Alex d’Arbeloff and Nick DeWolf, who were classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1940s. The men founded Teradyne in 1960, and set up shop in rented space above Joe and Nemo’s hotdog stand in downtown Boston. The name, Teradyne, was intended to represent a very forceful presence. 1,000,000,000,000 dynes = 10 meganewtons (2,248,089 pounds-force or 1,019,716 kilograms-force).
In 1961, they sold their first product, a diode tester, to Raytheon. Today, Teradyne operates major facilities in North Reading, Massachusetts; Agoura Hills, California; Tualatin, Oregon; Fridley, Minnesota, Buffalo Grove, Illinois, Teradyne Philippines, Teradyne Costa Rica and other locations worldwide.
Upon d'Arbeloff's retirement, George Chamillard assumed the post of President and CEO. He was replaced at his retirement by former CFO Mike Bradley. Bradley retired in January 2014, and was in turn replaced by Semiconductor Test Division president Mark Jagiela.[3]

In 2001, in an attempt to cut costs, Teradyne conducted layoffs within its workforce. This action was a response to the late 1990s tech boom collapse.[4]
In 2006, Teradyne sold its two Boston buildings and consolidated all of its Boston-area staff to the North Reading site. Teradyne also sold off its TCS (Teradyne Connection System) in 2006 in order to gather cash and focus on its core business to compete with other growing competitors like Advantest, Verigy and Eagle Test Systems.
In 2006, Teradyne cut costs to gather cash and buy back some of its shares. In order to cut cost, Teradyne laid off a number of employees in the US and Europe and now tries to relocate its main business unit to Asia (Singapore) and to outsource some of its business units. These steps were meant to increase profitability.
In December 2007, Teradyne announced intent to purchase Nextest Systems at a price of U.S. $20.00 per share.[5] This move was intended to allow the company to expand into the flash memory test market.[6]
In September 2008, Teradyne announced intent to purchase Eagle Test Systems. This move was intended to allow the company to expand into the Analog test market. Teradyne completed the acquisition of Eagle Test Systems on November 14, 2008.
Teradyne has obtained over 2,000 patents worldwide primarily through its research & development divisions in Massachusetts and California, but sometimes through acquisitions of companies such as the aforementioned Eagle Test Systems and the more recent LitePoint.[7]

Divisions[edit]
The Semiconductor Test Division manufactures test equipment used by integrated circuit manufacturers. As of 2006, Teradyne manufactures three principal families of testers known as the "J750", "FLEX" and "UltraFLEX". These testers are used by semiconductor manufacturers to test and classify the individual devices ("dies") on a completed semiconductor wafer and then used again to retest the parts once they are enclosed in their final packaging. UltraFLEX testers are capable of testing SOC (Mixed-signal, System on a chip) devices with more than 4000 pins and data rates extending beyond 10 GHz. Portions of this division were acquired when Teradyne purchased Megatest.
The Assembly Test Division builds testers that test completed circuit boards (Printed circuit boards/Printed Wiring Boards) and hard drives. Portions of this division were acquired when Teradyne purchased GenRad in 2002.
Vehicle Test Solutions, previously a division of GenRad based in Manchester in the United Kingdom, sells customized diagnostic equipment to automobile manufacturers worldwide. On 16 February 2011, Teradyne announced its intent to sell this division to SPX Corporation.[10]
Teradyne Connection Systems, based in Nashua, New Hampshire manufactures high-density electronic connectors, complete backplanes, and systems packaging. On 10 October 2005, Teradyne announced that this division was being sold to Amphenol for about US$ 390 million in cash.[11]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Divisions[edit]
The Semiconductor Test Division manufactures test equipment used by integrated circuit manufacturers. As of 2006, Teradyne manufactures three principal families of testers known as the "J750", "FLEX" and "UltraFLEX". These testers are used by semiconductor manufacturers to test and classify the individual devices ("dies") on a completed semiconductor wafer and then used again to retest the parts once they are enclosed in their final packaging. UltraFLEX testers are capable of testing SOC (Mixed-signal, System on a chip) devices with more than 4000 pins and data rates extending beyond 10 GHz. Portions of this division were acquired when Teradyne purchased Megatest.
The Assembly Test Division builds testers that test completed circuit boards (Printed circuit boards/Printed Wiring Boards) and hard drives. Portions of this division were acquired when Teradyne purchased GenRad in 2002.
Vehicle Test Solutions, previously a division of GenRad based in Manchester in the United Kingdom, sells customized diagnostic equipment to automobile manufacturers worldwide. On 16 February 2011, Teradyne announced its intent to sell this division to SPX Corporation.[10]
Teradyne Connection Systems, based in Nashua, New Hampshire manufactures high-density electronic connectors, complete backplanes, and systems packaging. On 10 October 2005, Teradyne announced that this division was being sold to Amphenol for about US$ 390 million in cash.[11]

History[edit]




Nick DeWolf, Teradyne co-founder, 1959


Teradyne was founded by Alex d’Arbeloff and Nick DeWolf, who were classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1940s. The men founded Teradyne in 1960, and set up shop in rented space above Joe and Nemo’s hotdog stand in downtown Boston. The name, Teradyne, was intended to represent a very forceful presence. 1,000,000,000,000 dynes = 10 meganewtons (2,248,089 pounds-force or 1,019,716 kilograms-force).
In 1961, they sold their first product, a diode tester, to Raytheon. Today, Teradyne operates major facilities in North Reading, Massachusetts; Agoura Hills, California; Tualatin, Oregon; Fridley, Minnesota, Buffalo Grove, Illinois, Teradyne Philippines, Teradyne Costa Rica and other locations worldwide.
Upon d'Arbeloff's retirement, George Chamillard assumed the post of President and CEO. He was replaced at his retirement by former CFO Mike Bradley. Bradley retired in January 2014, and was in turn replaced by Semiconductor Test Division president Mark Jagiela.[3]

In 2001, in an attempt to cut costs, Teradyne conducted layoffs within its workforce. This action was a response to the late 1990s tech boom collapse.[4]
In 2006, Teradyne sold its two Boston buildings and consolidated all of its Boston-area staff to the North Reading site. Teradyne also sold off its TCS (Teradyne Connection System) in 2006 in order to gather cash and focus on its core business to compete with other growing competitors like Advantest, Verigy and Eagle Test Systems.
In 2006, Teradyne cut costs to gather cash and buy back some of its shares. In order to cut cost, Teradyne laid off a number of employees in the US and Europe and now tries to relocate its main business unit to Asia (Singapore) and to outsource some of its business units. These steps were meant to increase profitability.
In December 2007, Teradyne announced intent to purchase Nextest Systems at a price of U.S. $20.00 per share.[5] This move was intended to allow the company to expand into the flash memory test market.[6]
In September 2008, Teradyne announced intent to purchase Eagle Test Systems. This move was intended to allow the company to expand into the Analog test market. Teradyne completed the acquisition of Eagle Test Systems on November 14, 2008.
Teradyne has obtained over 2,000 patents worldwide primarily through its research & development divisions in Massachusetts and California, but sometimes through acquisitions of companies such as the aforementioned Eagle Test Systems and the more recent LitePoint.[7]

Divisions[edit]
The Semiconductor Test Division manufactures test equipment used by integrated circuit manufacturers. As of 2006, Teradyne manufactures three principal families of testers known as the "J750", "FLEX" and "UltraFLEX". These testers are used by semiconductor manufacturers to test and classify the individual devices ("dies") on a completed semiconductor wafer and then used again to retest the parts once they are enclosed in their final packaging. UltraFLEX testers are capable of testing SOC (Mixed-signal, System on a chip) devices with more than 4000 pins and data rates extending beyond 10 GHz. Portions of this division were acquired when Teradyne purchased Megatest.
The Assembly Test Division builds testers that test completed circuit boards (Printed circuit boards/Printed Wiring Boards) and hard drives. Portions of this division were acquired when Teradyne purchased GenRad in 2002.
Vehicle Test Solutions, previously a division of GenRad based in Manchester in the United Kingdom, sells customized diagnostic equipment to automobile manufacturers worldwide. On 16 February 2011, Teradyne announced its intent to sell this division to SPX Corporation.[10]
Teradyne Connection Systems, based in Nashua, New Hampshire manufactures high-density electronic connectors, complete backplanes, and systems packaging. On 10 October 2005, Teradyne announced that this division was being sold to Amphenol for about US$ 390 million in cash.[11]

History[edit]




Nick DeWolf, Teradyne co-founder, 1959


Teradyne was founded by Alex d’Arbeloff and Nick DeWolf, who were classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1940s. The men founded Teradyne in 1960, and set up shop in rented space above Joe and Nemo’s hotdog stand in downtown Boston. The name, Teradyne, was intended to represent a very forceful presence. 1,000,000,000,000 dynes = 10 meganewtons (2,248,089 pounds-force or 1,019,716 kilograms-force).
In 1961, they sold their first product, a diode tester, to Raytheon. Today, Teradyne operates major facilities in North Reading, Massachusetts; Agoura Hills, California; Tualatin, Oregon; Fridley, Minnesota, Buffalo Grove, Illinois, Teradyne Philippines, Teradyne Costa Rica and other locations worldwide.
Upon d'Arbeloff's retirement, George Chamillard assumed the post of President and CEO. He was replaced at his retirement by former CFO Mike Bradley. Bradley retired in January 2014, and was in turn replaced by Semiconductor Test Division president Mark Jagiela.[3]

In 2001, in an attempt to cut costs, Teradyne conducted layoffs within its workforce. This action was a response to the late 1990s tech boom collapse.[4]
In 2006, Teradyne sold its two Boston buildings and consolidated all of its Boston-area staff to the North Reading site. Teradyne also sold off its TCS (Teradyne Connection System) in 2006 in order to gather cash and focus on its core business to compete with other growing competitors like Advantest, Verigy and Eagle Test Systems.
In 2006, Teradyne cut costs to gather cash and buy back some of its shares. In order to cut cost, Teradyne laid off a number of employees in the US and Europe and now tries to relocate its main business unit to Asia (Singapore) and to outsource some of its business units. These steps were meant to increase profitability.
In December 2007, Teradyne announced intent to purchase Nextest Systems at a price of U.S. $20.00 per share.[5] This move was intended to allow the company to expand into the flash memory test market.[6]
In September 2008, Teradyne announced intent to purchase Eagle Test Systems. This move was intended to allow the company to expand into the Analog test market. Teradyne completed the acquisition of Eagle Test Systems on November 14, 2008.
