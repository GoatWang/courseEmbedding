According to BusinessWeek, Oberndorf "is the Chairman of Aggregates USA and Rosewood Hotels & Resorts . . . [and] a Director Emeritus of Plum Creek Timber Co."[7]
Obendorf was formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors of Voyager Learning Company, a private for-profit education company providing curricula that was acquired by Cambium Learning, Inc. (a publicly traded for-profit company that provides education curricula) in 2009. He had been a director since July 1988 and was "Chairman of the Compensation Committee in addition to serving on the Nominating and Governance Committee," according to a former iteration of Voyager's website.[8]

Oberndorf and his wife Susan have donated over $3.2 million to candidates, third parties, and ballot measures at the state level from 2002 through 2012, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.[13] More information about his donations to support or oppose ballot measures is available here.
Oberndorf and his wife gave almost $115,000 to candidates for statewide office and the legislature just in Wisconsin from 2003 through June 2012, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.[14]
Oberndorf and his wife Susan have donated over $283,000 to candidates, PACs, SuperPACs, and parties from 2008 to 2013, ranging from Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner (OH), Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (SC), and Republican PACs and local parties across the country, to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein (CA) and Democratic Senator Harry Reid (D), according to the Center for Responsive Politics.[15]

Mr. Oberndorf is a founding partner of SPO Partners & Co., a private equity investment firm which holds approximately 21 percent of Calpine’s shares. Mr. Oberndorf was elected by the Board to fill the director seat held by William J. Patterson, Calpine’s former board chairman and managing partner at SPO Partners until his death in September 2010. J. Stuart Ryan, a venture partner with SPO Partners and a Calpine Board member since January 2008, was named Chairman of Calpine’s board on November 3, 2010.  Mr. Oberndorf currently serves as chairman of the boards of directors of Aggregates USA and Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, on the investment committee of Hotel Equity Funds and as director emeritus of Plum Creek Timber Co. Previously, he was board chairman of Voyager Learning Company and a member of the boards of Taft Broadcasting Company and Wometco Cable Television Corporation.  “Bill’s business and investment acumen and experience make him particularly well-suited to represent our shareholders in providing guidance and oversight to management,” said Calpine’s Chief Executive Officer and President Jack Fusco. “We are delighted to have Bill on the Board and look forward to his contributions to our vision of becoming the premier independent power company in the nation.”  Mr. Oberndorf also serves a number of non-profit organizations with a particular emphasis on education reform. He is currently chairman emeritus of the American Federation for Children and the Alliance for School Choice and remains a board member of the latter and is a trustee of the Thacher School in Ojai, California, The University of California San Francisco Foundation and the University School in Cleveland, Ohio. He formerly served as trustee of Williams College, the Stanford University Graduate School of Business Trust, University High School in San Francisco and the Bay Area Discovery Museum. Such activities have earned Mr. Oberndorf honors from the Black Alliance for Education Options and the Philanthropy Roundtable. He is the 2010 recipient of the John T. Walton Champions for Education Choice Award.

Oberndorf Entities Announce Acquisition of Shares in Bonterra Energy Corp.
			  



























































 





















SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 20, 2015 /CNW/ - William E. Oberndorf announced today that an entity controlled by him has acquired beneficial ownership of 64,681 common shares of Bonterra Energy Corp. ("Bonterra") as a result of purchases over the Toronto Stock Exchange, representing approximately 0.195% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Bonterra (based on a total of 33,143,435 common shares issued and outstanding). Together with the common shares already owned by Mr. Oberndorf, entities controlled by him and accounts over which he exercises control or direction (collectively, the "Oberndorf Entities") and persons acting jointly or in concert with them, the Oberndorf Entities and their joint actors beneficially own an aggregate of 3,349,837 common shares, representing approximately 10.107% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Bonterra.
The Oberndorf Entities acquired the common shares for investment purposes.  Consistent with such purpose, the Oberndorf Entities have had, and may have in the future, discussions with management of Bonterra and may make suggestions concerning Bonterra's operations, prospects, business and financial strategies, assets and liabilities, business and financing alternatives and such other matters as the Oberndorf Entities may deem relevant to their investments in the common shares and other securities of Bonterra.  Each of the Oberndorf Entities expects that it will, from time to time, review its investment position in Bonterra and may, depending on market and other conditions, increase or decrease its investment position in the common shares or other securities of Bonterra.
Whether the Oberndorf Entities acquire any additional common shares or other securities of Bonterra or dispose of any common shares or other securities of Bonterra, and the amount and timing of any such transactions, will depend upon the Oberndorf Entities' individual continuing assessments of pertinent factors, including, but not limited to, the availability of common shares or other securities of Bonterra for purchase at particular price levels, Bonterra's and the particular Oberndorf Entity's business and prospects, other business investment opportunities available to the particular Oberndorf Entity, economic conditions, stock market conditions, money market conditions, the attitudes and actions of the board of directors and management of Bonterra, the availability and nature of opportunities to dispose of the particular Oberndorf Entity's interest in Bonterra, to realize trading profits or minimize trading losses, and other plans and requirements of the particular Oberndorf Entity.  Depending upon its individual assessments of these factors from time to time, each Oberndorf Entity may change its present intentions as stated above, including determining to acquire additional common shares or other securities of Bonterra (by means of open market or privately negotiated purchases) or to dispose of some or all of the common shares or other securities of Bonterra held by or under the control of such Oberndorf Entity.  In addition, each Oberndorf Entity may from time to time enter into equity swap or other derivative transactions with respect to its investment in the common shares or other securities of Bonterra. 
William E. Oberndorf will be filing a report (as contemplated by National Instrument 62-103 – The Early Warning System and Related Takeover Bid and Insider Reporting Issues) in connection with the acquisition of the Bonterra common shares.

The Rainmakers: California's top political donors, 2001-2011
Lavishing their largesse on legislators and political committees alike, the largest donors to California politics spent $1.25 billion from 2001 through 2011. The group — 50 special interests and 50 wealthy individuals — spans the Golden State's social order. They are corporate leaders and venture capitalists, real estate developers and Hollywood scions. They are energy and tobacco companies, labor unions and tribal governments. Collectively, they shelled out a third of all the money given to campaigns in the state during the 11-year period. This data includes only contributions to candidates and ballot measure committees, not independent expenditure groups.
