Fabrinet: Under The Radar And Undervalued - Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Fabrinet: Under The Radar And UndervaluedMay. 5.16 | About: Fabrinet (FN) Kumquat Research Momentum, event-driven, long/short equity, valueSummaryFabrinet has quietly provided a 100% return over the past 12 months.Revenue and earnings continue to grow at a robust pace, as evidenced by the company's most recent earnings report.The stock is far from fairly valued. Expect substantial upside. Introduction: Fabrinet Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) is one of those companies that has quietly begun a meteoric rise with little attention from investors. The stock closed at $36.05 on Tuesday, after an impressive Q3 report on volume of 1.38 million shares. The stock's average daily volume is just 323,000 shares. Yet, this fairly unknown company has returned 100% over the past 12 months and does not look poised to cool off anytime soon. At current levels, this stock is a screaming buy, and I'll prove it in this article. 

 FN data by YCharts I normally dislike buying any stock after it reaches all-time highs, but after doing a bit of digging, I have come to the conclusion that FN's run has more open space ahead of it. Company Overview From Fabrinet's most recent earnings report: Fabrinet is a leading provider of advanced optical packaging and precision optical, electro-mechanical, and electronic manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers of complex products, such as optical communication components, modules and subsystems, industrial lasers and sensors. Fabrinet offers a broad range of advanced optical and electro-mechanical capabilities across the entire manufacturing process, including process design and engineering, supply chain management, manufacturing, advanced packaging, integration, final assembly and test. Fabrinet focuses on production of high complexity products in any mix and any volume. Fabrinet maintains engineering and manufacturing resources and facilities in Thailand, the People's Republic of China and the United States of America. As you can tell, Fabrinet makes a ton of stuff. The language it uses to describe its products is somewhat vague, so I found a slide in the company's Q3 2016 investor presentation that outlines Fabrinet's offerings with more specificity: 

 The three main markets the company services are sensors, optical components and lasers, and the slide above gives an idea of some of the products manufactured for each market. Fabrinet was founded in 2000 by David T. Mitchell, who was also a co-founder of Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). Mitchell serves as chairman and CEO of the Bangkok, Thailand-based company, and with his experience as an executive and his leadership, Fabrinet has been able to penetrate and thrive in expanding markets. 

 Now that we have some context for the company, let's get to analyzing the actual business. The Product Mix and Growth In its most recent conference call, Fabrinet CFO TS Ng broke down the company's revenues by segment as follows: - 77% of total revenue attributed to optical communications.  56% telecommunications revenue 44% data communications revenue  - 23% of total revenue attributed to non-optical communications.  47% laser market revenue 35% automotive revenue 18% other revenue  Each product segment listed here saw year-over-year ("YoY") growth in Q3 2016, which indicates that Fabrinet is indeed positioned for success. By far the most important segment in terms of revenue contribution was optical communications, which saw YoY growth of 41% to $192.2 million. That growth was driven by strength in both the telecommunications business, which grew by 29% YoY, and the data communications business, which grew by a whopping 60% YoY. The rapid growth in the datacom and telecom segments has mostly been driven by a shift from 10-gig and 40-gig (gigabits per second) solutions to 100-gig solutions. On the conference call, Ng said that the weakness from the former products were heavily outweighed by the strength in 100-gig product offerings. In fact, he said that 100-gig shipments represented two-thirds of total optical communication shipments. This reflects a growing trend in all communications businesses for increasingly higher bandwidth, which Fabrinet sees as an indicator of strong future growth in the telecom and, more importantly, datacom segments of its business. While optical communications revenue is currently Fabrinet's bread and butter, the company is still focused on diversifying its revenue streams. Non-optical communications revenue represents that diversification, and it too saw robust growth in Q3. Non-optical communications revenue increased by 11% YoY to $58.7 million, which includes growth in the lasers, sensors, and "other" segments. Laser revenue increased 8% YoY, non-automotive sensor revenue increased by 50% YoY, and automotive sensor revenue increased as well, 12% YoY. With Fabrinet firing on all cylinders, it's no surprise the market reacted by bidding FN up nearly 12% on Tuesday. In terms of guidance, the company expects Q4 revenue of between $260 million and $264 million, which represents 26% and 28% YoY growth respectively, and Q4 EPS of between $0.59 and $0.61 respectively. Additionally, for full-year 2016, Fabrinet expects revenue between $960.4 million and $964.4 million, which represents 24% and 25% YoY growth respectively. I am very impressed by the company's growth, and while the market has already rewarded FN for the outstanding quarterly earnings report, I still think the stock has immense potential upside from here. Let's now dig into Fabrinet's financials and expected future growth prospects. Growth Markets Let's start with the obvious one: optical communications. For those investors that could have foreseen the 100-gigabit surge coming, you could have made a pretty penny on FN and other optical communication product suppliers. I, unfortunately, did not, but after doing some research, I found the signs in hindsight. This article, which was written on May 20th, 2015, contained a quote from a man by the name of Andrew Schmitt, who stated the following: The market for 100G data center optics is accelerating, but it has yet to be turbocharged by widespread data center deployment in the way 40G QSFP optics have. This will change dramatically in 2016 as cheap 100G silicon reaches production and QSFP28 shipments surge as a result. Next year is going to be huge for 100GbE. Schmitt was exactly right. In 2015, just tens of thousands of 100-gig solutions were being shipped, but that figure is climbing fast. The following is a graphic from the mentioned article: 

 Source: optics.org 100-gig is expected to make up about 50% of the market by 2019, and those who are well positioned in the market are reaping the benefits. Schmitt, after predicting the rise of 100-gig in 2016, went on to mention a company by the name of Oclaro (NASDAQ:OCLR) as the main beneficiary of this trend. Over the past twelve months, OCLR is up 166%. 

 OCLR data by YCharts Fabrinet has also been reaping these benefits, and the shift towards 100-gig appears to have major staying power over the next few years. The 60% jump in datacom revenue YoY was driven by this shift, which will continue to spur massive growth. The optical telecommunications market is also expected to see continued growth. According to research from market research firm Markets and Markets, in 2014 telecom applications comprised 55.5% of the optical communication market, and this is expected to grow at a rate of 5.9% by 2019. In Fabrinet's investor presentation, the company provided the following graph which shows the expected growth of the optical communication market in general: 

 Telecom is also seeing a shift towards 100-gig connections, which should drive Fabrinet's revenue in the telecom segment, and the optical communications segment in general, for years. As the optical communications portion of the company currently generates 77% of the revenue, it is a fair assessment that the rise of 100-gig solutions for both telecom and datacom applications will continue to drive strong revenue growth. I expect top line growth in optical communications to increase about 20% over the next three years on the shoulders of the push for higher-bandwidth connections. In the non-optical communications segment, there is also evident growth opportunity for Fabrinet. Laser product revenue was up 8% YoY, and LaserFocusWorld, a laser market research site, forecasts total laser market growth of 4.2% in 2016 to $10.5 billion. Automotive sensors grew 12% YoY in Q3, in line with a fairly recent trend of automobiles becoming more complex and requiring more sensors. The following bar graph shows expected revenues of the automotive sensor market through 2021: 

 Source: Industry Arc Fabrinet's revenue growth prospects appear very promising, mainly within its optical communications business, but its less important contributors, which the company expects to make up a larger portion of its product mix in the future, also have potential. Now that we have looked at the market opportunities for Fabrinet and where revenue growth will come from in the future, let's take a look at the company's financials. Financials Fabrinet is a profitable company that earned net income of $20.8 million in Q3 and has earned a total of $55.2 million through the first three quarters of 2016. If we take the midpoint of management's revenue guidance, this yield $262 million, and combined with an expected gross margin around 12% and operating margin of around 9%, we get Q4 profit estimate of $23.5 million. Finally, we get a full-year 2016 profit estimate of $78.7 million. That is an impressive 80% increase from 2015 earnings. The boost in income was mostly due to increased revenue from 100-gig shipments, which also helped expand the company's gross margin from 11% in 2015 to an average of around 12.5% in 2016. Margins stand to continue gradual expansion as the ramp up of 100-gig demand continues for telecom and datacom applications. Fabrinet's balance sheet is also squeaky clean, with $266 million in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments and just $69 million in debt, of which just $1 million is long-term. The company has a healthy current ratio of 2.6, and the long-term assets-to-liabilities ratio of 3.2 is even better. While the income statement and balance sheet are pristine, free cash flow is a work in progress. For the nine months ending March 26, 2016 (the most recent quarter), Fabrinet recorded cash inflow from operating activities of $41.4 million and capital expenditure of $33.5 million. Free cash flow of $8 million in 9 months isn't exactly enamoring, but it's getting there. The company is still likely a long way from paying a dividend, and so that budding free cash flow is a sign of things to come. As revenue and earnings continue to grow, as I believe they will, the cash flow will follow closely behind. In terms of valuation, even after FN's nearly 100% gain over the past 12 months, I think the stock still has more potential upside in the coming months and years. If we estimate Q4 net income using Fabrinet's guidance, we get EPS for the quarter of $0.63 and earnings for 2016 of around $2.12 per share. At the current share price of $35.10, that translates to a P/E ratio of 16.5, which is fairly low already. But when we factor in the company's expected growth, the multiple falls significantly. We have received no official estimates from Fabrinet for beyond Q4 and full-year 2016, but I will construct conservative estimates using my expectations of earnings growth. If we take into consideration that the company's revenue growth was driven by 100-gig shipments, which are expected to continue fueling growth, we can estimate a sequential average growth rate of 5% for the four quarters of the coming 2017 fiscal year. The company's actual average quarter-over-quarter growth rate over the past four quarters has been slightly above 5%, and so this estimate is slightly conservative. To keep the estimate conservative, we will estimate a profit margin of 8%, which is slightly lower than the company's profit margin on its most recent earnings reports. My estimate will begin with the approximately $262 million Fabrinet has guided for Q4 2016.   Quarter Estimated Revenue Estimated EPS   Q1 2017 $275.1 million $0.59   Q2 2017 $288.9 million $0.62   Q3 2017 $303.3 million $0.66   Q4 2017 $318.5 million $0.69   Total $1.2 billion $2.56   Using my conservative metrics, I expect 2017 full-year EPS of $2.56, which would yield a forward P/E of 13.7 for Fabrinet. And when taking into consideration the company's growth beyond 2017, the stock appears extremely undervalued. Additionally, I fully expect Fabrinet to beat my 2017 EPS estimate. I think FN has been flying under the radar for a while now, but because of the stock's outstanding returns over the past year, it likely won't be unknown for very much longer. Fabrinet has all the makings of a growth company that is in the right market at the right time. I am setting a 12-month price target of $50 a share on the stock, indicating upside potential of 42% from its current price.

New Product Intro | Fabrinet




















































 
 






You are here: Home / Services / New Product IntroNew Product Introduction

New Product Introduction (NPI)
Fabrinet offers “One Stop Service;” from backend wafer processing to modules and system processes.
First Fabrinet’s NPI team receives the data of customer inputs (i.e. BOM, assembly drawing, component drawing, and test requirements). Then the NPI team can evaluate the feasibility of the proposed products and the requirements for it to be manufactured, assembled, tested, and delivered in a sufficient quantity and an acceptable cost.
The NPI team will then establish the process design and development planning after a preliminary “manufacturing feasibility study” is accepted by both parties. The manufacturing process design is developed after the preliminary design and development plan is issued.
A qualification build of product will be performed to validate the process designed and to ensure the resulting product can meet the requirements. The quality data and test specification data will be reviewed and documents will be updated to reflect any changes during process development. 
Summary of NPI work flow:

Review customer inputs
Feasibility study
Process design and development planning
Manufacturing process design
Process verification
Process validation
Prototype lot run
Product approval
Product released for mass volume

At Fabrinet, everyone really does know your name. Fabrinet customers experience this difference from the moment they step off the plane and during each factory visit.
