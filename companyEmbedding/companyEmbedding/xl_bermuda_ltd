Net income attributable to common shareholders of $301.6 million, or $1.14 per fully diluted share, and Operating net income of $255.1 million, or $0.96 per fully diluted share, for the quarter, compared to $43.8 million, or $0.15 per fully diluted share, and $106.4 million, or $0.37 per fully diluted share in the prior year quarter, respectively, both primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses and by favorable net income from affiliates discussed below. The increase in net income is further driven by lower realized losses related to the Life Funds Withheld Assets4. 
Net income from affiliates was $73.5 million for the quarter, compared to $34.6 million in the prior year quarter. This increase was driven mainly by the sale of one of our investment manager affiliates as well as strong performance in all categories of our affiliate holdings. 
Net investment income for the quarter was $208.7 million, compared to $215.4 million in the prior year quarter. Net investment income for the quarter, excluding the Life Funds Withheld Assets was $177.2 million, compared to $176.2 million in the prior year quarter. 
Operating expenses were 9.5% or $49.7 million favorable compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting our continuing focus on operating efficiency and leveraging our underwriting platform. Included in this decrease was a $17.5 million favorable impact resulting from foreign exchange movement. 
Income tax expense of $29.0 million was recognized during the quarter. Effective tax rate on net income of 8.8% for the quarter, compared to 5.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase over the prior year quarter is primarily driven by a greater relative proportion of earnings generated in taxable jurisdictions, partially offset by a decrease in the life retrocession embedded derivative loss, for which no tax benefit is provided. 
Fully diluted book value per common share increased by $1.05 from the end of the prior quarter to $42.15, driven by our net income, the increase in our unrealized gains on investments and share buybacks, partially offset by the payment of dividends. Fully diluted tangible book value per common share also increased by $0.88 from the end of the prior quarter to $33.71. 
Share buybacks totaled approximately 6.0 million shares at an average price of $41.87 per share or $250.1 million during the quarter, compared to 9.7 million shares or $328.3 million in the prior year quarter. During the first six months of 2017, share buybacks totaled approximately 11.1 million shares at an average price of $40.70 per share or $450.6 million. At June 30, 2017, $650.0 million of common shares remained available for purchase under our share buyback program.

P&C gross premiums written ("GPW") in the second quarter increased 0.7% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, GPW increased by 2.1% 
The Insurance segment GPW increased 2.6% from the prior year quarter driven primarily by growth in Political Risk, International Financial Lines and Global Risk Management. This increase was partially offset by decreases in Global lines and International property and casualty lines. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Insurance GPW increased 4.5%. 
The Reinsurance segment GPW decreased by 4.0% from the prior year quarter due to a non-recurring treaty in Q2 2016. Current quarter new business offset cancellations within the segment. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Reinsurance GPW decreased by 3.9%. 
The P&C loss ratio of 60.8% in the current quarter was 3.8 percentage points lower than in the prior year quarter. The P&C loss ratio variance was impacted by catastrophe pre-tax losses net of reinsurance and related reinstatement premiums of $92.1 million or 3.7 loss ratio points for the quarter, compared to $240.1 million, or 9.8 loss ratio points, in the prior year quarter, which was significantly impacted by the Fort McMurray Wildfire loss of nearly $130.0 million. Included in the P&C loss ratio was favorable prior year development of $86.7 million and $98.6 million in the current and prior year quarters, respectively. Excluding prior year development and catastrophe losses, the second quarter P&C loss ratio of 60.6% was 1.9 percentage points higher than in the prior year quarter. 
The Insurance segment loss ratio of 65.2%, or 61.4% excluding prior year development and catastrophe losses in the current quarter, was 0.6 percentage points higher in both cases than in the prior year quarter. 
The Reinsurance segment loss ratio in the current quarter of 52.4% was 12.1 percentage points lower than in the prior year quarter driven by the impact of catastrophe losses on the prior year; excluding prior year development and catastrophe losses it was 59.0% or 4.6 percentage points higher than in the prior year quarter primarily due to mix of business, unfavorable loss experience in short tail lines and a large facultative loss in Asia Pacific. 
The P&C combined ratio excluding prior year development and the impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter was 92.0%, compared to 90.3% for the prior year quarter. On the same basis, the Insurance segment combined ratio in the quarter was 92.9%, compared to 92.6% for the prior year quarter, while the Reinsurance segment was 90.3% in the quarter, compared to 85.5% for prior year quarter.

(j) our ability to successfully implement our business strategy; (k) our ability to successfully attract and raise additional third party capital for existing or new investment vehicles; (l) changes in credit ratings and rating agency policies or practices, which could trigger cancelation provisions in our assumed reinsurance agreements or impact the availability of our credit facilities;

(o) unanticipated constraints on our liquidity, including the availability of borrowings and letters of credit under credit facilities that inhibit our ability to support our operations, including our ability to underwrite policies and pay claims; (p) the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to XL Group Ltd, XLIT Ltd. and Catlin Insurance Company Ltd; (q) changes in regulators or regulations applicable to us, including as a result of the completion of our redomestication from Ireland to Bermuda, such as changes in regulatory capital balances that our operating subsidiaries must maintain, or to our brokers or customers;

(x) changes in general economic conditions, including the political, monetary, economic and operational impacts of the "Brexit" referendum held on June 23, 2016 in which the UK electorate voted to withdraw from the EU, new or continued sovereign debt concerns in Euro-Zone countries or emerging markets such as Brazil or China, or governmental actions for the purposes of stabilizing financial markets; (y) changes in applicable tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof; (z) judicial decisions and rulings, new theories of liability or emerging claims coverage issues, legal tactics and settlement terms;

Note 1: Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Note 2: Investment results for the Life Funds Withheld Assets - including interest income, unrealized gains and losses, and gains and losses from sales - are passed directly to the reinsurer pursuant to a contractual arrangement that is accounted for as a derivative. Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with these GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements are reflected within "Net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets" in the reconciliation above.
Note 3: Defined as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders excluding: (1) our net investment income - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (2) our net realized (gains) losses on investments sold - excluding Life Funds Withheld Assets, (3) our net realized (gains) losses on investments sold (including OTTI) and net unrealized (gains) losses on investments, Trading - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (4) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, (5) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (6) our share of items (2) and (4) for our insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, (7) our foreign exchange (gains) losses, (8) our expenses related to the Catlin Acquisition, (9) our gain on the sale of our interest in ARX Holding Corp., (10) our gain on the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary XL Life Insurance and Annuity Company and the partial sale of our holdings in New Ocean Capital Management, (11) our loss on the inception of the U.S. Term Life Retro Arrangements, (12) our loss on the early extinguishment of the notes assumed in conjunction with the Catlin Acquisition, and (13) a provision (benefit) for income tax on items excluded from operating income. We believe that showing "operating net income (loss)", "annualized operating return on average common shareholders' equity including and excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of integration costs" enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how we analyze our performance. In this regard, we believe that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) would make it more difficult for users of our financial information to evaluate our underlying business. We also believe that equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow us (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons, and they request that we provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis. A reconciliation of our net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to operating net income (loss) is provided above.
Note 4: Diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is used to calculate per share data except where it is anti-dilutive to earnings per share or where there is a net loss. When it is anti-dilutive or when a net loss occurs, basic weighted average common shares outstanding is utilized in the calculation of net loss per share and net operating loss per share.
Note 5: Integration costs related to the Catlin Acquisition were completed in the second quarter of 2017.
Comment on Regulation G
XL presents its operations in ways it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XL's financial information in evaluating XL's performance.  This press release contains the presentation of (i) operating net income (loss) ("Operating Net Income"), which is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders excluding:(1) our net investment income - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (2) our net realized (gains) losses on investments sold - excluding Life Funds Withheld Assets, (3) our net realized (gains) losses on investments sold (including OTTI) and net unrealized (gains) losses on investments, Trading - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (4) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, (5) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (6) our share of items (2) and (4) for our insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, (7) our foreign exchange (gains) losses, (8) our expenses related to the Catlin Acquisition, (9) our gain on the sale of our interest in ARX Holding Corp., (10) our gain on the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary XL Life Insurance and Annuity Company and the partial sale of our holdings in New Ocean Capital Management, (11) our loss on the inception of the U.S. Term Life Retro Arrangements, (12) our loss on the early extinguishment of the notes assumed in conjunction with the Catlin Acquisition, and (13) a provision (benefit) for income tax on items excluded from operating income; (ii) annualized return on average common shareholders' equity ("ROE") based on operating net income (loss) ("Operating ROE"); (iii) Operating ROE excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of integration costs; and (iv) Fully diluted tangible book value per common share  (common shareholders' equity excluding goodwill and intangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding at the period end date combined with the dilutive impact of potential future share issues at any period end). These items are "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included in this press release on pages [10] and [11].
Although the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realize capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XL's operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process.  In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be recognized as the result of other than temporary declines in value and from goodwill impairment charges without actual realization.  In this regard, certain users of XL's financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the operational sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely a function of economic and interest rate conditions.
Net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than certain credit derivatives and the life retrocession embedded derivative. With respect to credit derivatives, because XL and its insurance company operating affiliates generally hold financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies' treatment of such contracts), as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance.
Net investment income - Life Funds Withheld Assets, and net realized (gains) losses on the life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets, have been excluded because, as a result of the GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangement, XL no longer shares in the risks and rewards of the underlying performance of the Life Funds Withheld Assets that support these retrocession arrangements.  The returns on the Life Funds Withheld Assets are passed directly to the reinsurer pursuant to a contractual arrangement that is accounted for as a derivative.  Therefore, net investment income from the Life Funds Withheld Assets and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with these GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements are not relevant to XL's underlying business performance.
Foreign exchange (gains) losses in the income statement are only one element of the overall impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on XL's financial position and are not representative of any economic gain or loss made by XL.  Accordingly, it is not a relevant indicator of financial performance and it is excluded.
In summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing operating net income (loss) enables investors and other users of XL's financial information to analyze XL's performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) would make it much more difficult for users of XL's financial information to evaluate XL's underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.
Operating ROE is a widely used measure of any company's profitability that is calculated by dividing annualized operating net income for any period other than a fiscal year when actual operating income is used by the average of the opening and closing common shareholders' equity. XL establishes target Operating ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If XL's Operating ROE targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, XL seeks to re-evaluate these lines. Operating ROE including and excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of integration costs, are additional measures of Company profitability.  The most significant component of this exclusion is the mark to market fluctuations on XL's investment portfolio that have not been realized through sales, and/or distortions to XL's performance from integration costs related to the acquisition of Catlin.  By providing these additional measures, users of our financial statements have the ability to include or exclude these items when considering our performance either on a standalone basis or for purposes of peer performance comparison.
XL believes that fully diluted tangible book value per common share is a financial measure important to investors and other interested parties who benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry.  However, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Beaches


 
 










Coves & Crescents of Pink Sand
Bermuda’s dramatic coastline holds hidden coves and wide crescents of beach, all blanketed by that iconic pale-pink sand and brushed by gentle surf. Some beaches are popular and prized, like Horseshoe Bay Beach, which USA Today named one of the Caribbean’s top 10 beaches (even though Bermuda isn’t technically in the Caribbean). Other beaches feel like secluded island hideaways. You’ll find great beaches across the island, but the famous South Shore is a perfect starting point.
 




 






Key Points of Interest
From from sweeping crescents of pink sand to secluded rocky coves, some of Bermuda’s top beaches are plotted below. To browse a full list of Bermuda’s beaches, scroll down the page. 









Beaches Highlights
Whether you’re into active beaches or relaxing on quiet stretches of shore, you’ll find Bermuda beaches that fit your style – great places to swim, explore, watch wildlife, catch sunset and celebrate.
