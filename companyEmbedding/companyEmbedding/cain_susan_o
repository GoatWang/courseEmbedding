                                Report abuseTranscript of Quiet by Susan CainThe kinds of arguments are factual, definition, evaluation, proposal. The kind of argument that Quiet contains is a proposal because Susan Cain presents our extroverted world as a problem for introverts. She also speaks of solutions to help and explain introverts.KindSummaryThroughout Quiet, Susan tells about the life of introverts and many misconceptions that people have about introverts. She explains the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also clears up the confusion between introversion and just being shy. Quiet helps to find out more about yourself and why you may react or feel the way you do in certain situations. Today's society has a bias toward extroverts called "The Extrovert Ideal". Cain takes a stance against this by enforcing that introverts are not less in comparison to extroverts.PurposeAccording to Everything's an Argument, the purposes of arguments include to inform, convince, explore, make decisions, and to meditate and pray. This novel was an argument to inform. Susan Cain includes numerous facts and plentiful research in the novel to provide readers with little-known information that clears up misconceptions about introverts and extroverts. Occasion Occasions for arguments include arguments about the past (forensic), future (deliberative), & present (ceremonial). This novel is an argument about thepresent because it takes a stance against our present bias towards extroverts called the "Extrovert Ideal". By: Ariana Chiapas,Teagan Fors, &Nicole OyewunmiQuiet by Susan CainThere are not specific groups that allaudiences fit into in Everything'san Argument. We believe that the audience was intended to be introverts becausethey can best relate to the information in thenovel. Susan Cain probably wanted to show introverts their true power so that they would go out into the world and change the perspective ofothers.The types of appeals are emotional (pathos),ethical (ethos), and logical (logos). Quiet would best fit into the category of emotional appeal because it uses details and anecdotes to allow readers to empathize with introverts.The example used in Everything's an Argument was that campuses should providemore wheelchair access for students, whichrelates to the argument in Quiet thatthe world should provide a more acceptingview of introverts.1) Text to self: We are all introverts andwe connect to the feeling of havingto fake extroversion in order to feel acceptedand intelligent. This book shows that it is not necessary or healthy to hide who you really are and taught us strategies of how to use ourpersonalities to our advantage.2) Text to Text: This book connects to Outliers because it uses some of the same information, butwith different explanations. *Quiet says Asians are more successful because of an introverted culture that promotes hard work. While in Outliers Asians are more successful due to hard work alone. 3.) Text to World: Many schools across the country usegroup settings in their classrooms and these groups areused in many activities. Research has shown that thesegroups are not the most productive method. Yet, as Western culture spreads, more and more schools around the world are adopting this group ideal, therefore adopting the extrovert ideal.

I'm with @BrandonVDixon. @realDonaldTrump must stop using tweets to criticize free speech he disagrees with. That's unAmerican.

By Mimi Zeiger2 minute ReadIntroverts of the workplace are having a moment. The office furniture company Steelcase teamed up with Susan Cain, author of the bestseller Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking, to create a series of five spaces that address the need for more focus and privacy at work.advertisementThe collection, called Susan Cain Quiet Spaces, comes right in the middle of a long-established era in which open, non-hierarchical workplaces are the norm at any startup. Private offices and cubicles are, increasingly, seen as the nostalgic stuff of Mad Men. But everyone knows how frustrating it is to  take a phone call that requires privacy or to get serious creative work done amidst the distractions that naturally pop up in an open-plan office. “In the past we would talk about the benefits of collaboration, visibility, and the ability to show people work in progress,” explains Steelcase’s application design manager Vanessa Bradley. “There is a message here about balance.”

The company grounds its designs in two workplace surveys that looked at privacy and well-being. Of the 39,000 North American workers polled in the survey, 95% of workers reported the need for quiet spaces that allow for confidential conversations. This could be calling your doctor or a spot for a conference call with a key client.Susan Cain looks at the contemporary office and offers a critique. “It is an impoverished way of looking at space,” she says pointedly. “I felt very strongly that there is a whole emotional range of human experience that is not included in the workplace.”The five spaces offered by Steelcase vary from 48 to 100 square feet; the larger spaces are collaborative. The space names evoke the nature of the experience: Be Me, Studio, Mind Share, Flow, Green Room. Each sits somewhere on the sensory scale between a Zen garden and a writing studio. Surprisingly, perhaps, for an office furniture company, Steelcase is less concerned with the bottom line of efficiency or productivity, and instead describes the collection in somewhat New Age terminology. But how do you translate such concept-driven terms as “well-being,” “authenticity,” “mindfulness,” “vitality,” and “belonging” into design?

According to Cain, the spaces are intended to offer respite–they are places to relax, meditate, nap, or focus. “They are cozy and inviting,” she says. “Unlike the private office of yesteryear, workers flow freely in and out of these shared spaces.” The Be Me, for instance, offers alone time via controllable and sound-masking wall finishes. It comes with the company’s Lagunitas lounger and room for a yoga mat. Suggested finishes in all the rooms are tactile; the company will work with clients to develop a materials palette that blends into the overall officescape.The two-person Mind Share is geared to intimate conversation and, in the words of Steelcase, “entrusted confidence.” It comes with dimmable lights, a big table, integrated digital screens, and whiteboards for brainstorming. “People are afraid to talk about intimacy in the workplace because of the implications. But we need to make space for it,” says Cain. “One of the problems with open-plan offices is that people are less likely to make friends because they feel like they will be overheard, but friendship requires the exchange of confidences.”advertisementIf Susan Cain Quiet Spaces sounds like a surefire way for the workplace to devolve into catnaps and downward dogs, Cain and Bradley stress that introversion is good for business, and cite the positive effects that meditation has on productivity. “The more employee well-being is nurtured, the better their work,” Cain asserts.advertisementRelated StoriesGraphicsDisney Has A Stupidly Simple Fix For Mixed Reality’s Big ProblemInnovation By DesignBiased AI Is A Threat To Civil Liberties.
