Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Lee, Daniel R carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Lee, Daniel R



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Lee, Daniel R



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Daniel R. Lee
DANIEL R. LEE, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Mirage Resorts,
graduated from Cornell’s School of Hotel Administration in 1977. Mr. Lee
became an Operations Analyst for Hilton International, based in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, then returned to Cornell, receiving an MBA from its
graduate business school in 1980. Combining his background with the MBA,
he joined the Wall Street firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert as its research
analyst for the hospitality industries. In his ten years with Drexel, he
was recognized numerous times for his industry research and was an
integral part of the team that provided much of the financing during the
mid-80s for the lodging and casino industries. He became a Managing
Director of Drexel in 1989. In 1990, Mr. Lee joined First Boston as a
Director of Equity Research and continued his advisory and capital-
raising activities for the industry. Mr. Lee joined Mirage Resorts in
February 1992 as its Senior Vice President-Finance and Development. In
September 1992, he was also named Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Over the past seven years, Mr. Lee has overseen the dramatic revamping
of Mirage’s balance sheet and participated in the planning and execution
of the Company’s growth. The market capitalization of the company’s
stock has risen eight-fold since Mr. Lee joined the company five years
ago, to $4.0 billion. Mr. Lee has also overseen the financing of
Mirage’s $3 billion of projects now in development or under
construction. Mr. Lee lives in Las Vegas. He is a Chartered Financial
Analyst and a member of the Cornell Society of Hotelmen. He enjoys
skiing, bicycling and flying his own airplane.

What is the Tomatometer®?



                    The Tomatometer rating – based on the published opinions of hundreds of film and
                    television critics – is a trusted measurement of movie and TV programming quality
                    for millions of moviegoers. It represents the percentage of professional critic reviews
                    that are positive for a given film or television show.

                    It's not an interpretation of actual history as much as it is a reduced revision of movie history.

                    The Butler proves a decent, significant, but slightly stodgy affair. Its dignified restraint stifles its anger.

Dwight BrownNational Newspaper Publishers Association 










                    The Butler's final notes have too strongly followed through on traditional, slightly staid dramatics to have it both ways.

                    Is anyone else in America making films like Lee Daniels? For my money, he deserves his name above the title.

Edward LawrensonThe Big Issue










                    The breadth of the subject matter tirelessly works against director Lee Daniels and company, leading to some inevitably goofy casting choices and unfortunate make-up work.

                    The excitement comes from watching the director's rude energy chafe up against the constraints of a traditional Oscar-bait biopic.

Audience Reviews for Lee Daniels' The Butler







½

                   A somewhat moving film done with grace and dignity, but lacking the emotional heft to be profound.  Although Whitaker and Winfrey deliver, the performances of the rest of the A-List ensemble cast is hit-or-miss.  Entertaining but unnervingly episodic.








            Christian C Super Reviewer








½

                   This film tries to accomplish several tasks without doing so, and doesn't quite meet expectations at every turn. The premise follows butler Cecil Gaines (Whitaker) as he works for many generations of presidents; through their tenures at the White House. Throw in celebrity cameo depictions of presidents (Robin Williams, James Marsden, Liev Shreiber) and some feel-good humor and it's obvious Oscar bait. In actuality the film centers on Cecil and his family, and their fight for civil rights while being surrounded by the nation's turmoil. It tries to be explicit with language and violence, but it's meant to be more subdued. It never quite seems realistic or historically accurate, because it tries to fit into historical events that mattered. His children fall into every historical event or movement dealing with civil rights. One son knows and marches with Martin Luther King Jr. then becomes a Black Panther. Another goes to Vietnam. Meanwhile Cecil influences policy with every president he meets. Sadly, this is supposed to be based on a true story, but liberties were gratuitously taken: the name of the butler is changed, his influence is exaggerated, and the stories about his sons are completely fabricated. Every performance seems strained, especially Oprah's and Whitaker's, and it shows with every passing moment. In the end Ronald Reagan is shown as the hero, and it slows until it's a painful crawl. It's too long, too pretentious, and just too problematic for its own good.








            Spencer S. Super Reviewer










                   I'm really glad I saw this movie if just for the fact that I am ignorant of the Civil Rights movement and what it meant to real live people and in fact, I think that's when this movie came alive:  when the Freedom Riders and the Black Panthers took the stage.  That these kids might be at odds with their conservative-let's-not-rock-the-boat parents was a revelation.  Weird casting choice for presidents (John Cusack as Nixon?  Robin Williams as Dwight Eisenhower?) managed to nonetheless work.  I didn't remember that Reagan was such a butt-head about race.  Forest Whitaker, the Big O, are great.








            Bathsheba Monk Super Reviewer










                   It's a heartwarming and important story to tell, but the gross historical inaccuracies and liberal brow-beating kept me from enjoying it. The cast is superb for the most part, but the casting left me shaking my head at times. If Lee Daniels wanted to make a "rise from discrimination to the pinnacle of power" story, then more power to him, but the liberties he takes along the way are inflammatory sensationalism and sometimes downright dishonest character assassination. I am referring specifically to the mischaracterization of Ronald Reagan.  Reagan biographer Paul Kengor interviewed many White House staff, cooks, housekeepers, doctors, and Secret Service over the years, and reported "they are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan." Also, Kengor adds that Reagan's opposition to change in South Africa only concerned that it not become a USSR- satellite communist state. 

My summation of the casting is mixed as well. Forest Whitaker is outstanding as always. He and Oprah Winfrey carry the film; their powerful understated performances, I think, successfully portray the struggles and perseverance the real people must have demonstrated. I also note Terrence Howard, Cuba Gooding Jr., David Oyelowo, and Vanessa Redgrave as delivering superb performances. However, the casting of John Cusack as President Nixon and Jane Fonda, most egregiously as Nancy Reagan, can only be described as a sick inside joke. This must be the producers'' idea of retaliation against anything Republican. 

Overall, as I've said, it's a story that deserves to be told, but this particular production is melodramatic overkill. It's contrived for dramatic effect. Instead I recommend "The Help," "The Color Purple," and especially "The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman." Presented as the story of the struggles of one black family dealing with changing attitudes through a time of difficult transition in American history,  The Butler is exceptional and noteworthy.
