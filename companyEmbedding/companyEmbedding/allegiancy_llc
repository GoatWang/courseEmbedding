Meet the Commercial Real Estate Investors at Allegiancy

“I view Allegiancy as a multi-generational enterprise: from the entrepreneurial values of my grandfather and father, to the longer-term value for my children and grandchildren. My aim is for Allegiancy to be bringing unparalleled value to owners long after I am gone.”
– Chris Sadler, Allegiancy President






Meet Our Commercial Real Estate Investors

Our DNA traces back to the solid, rural values ingrained in the lives of our founders, brothers Chris and Steve Sadler. The Sadlers grew up on a south Louisiana farm that valued hard work, responsibilities and troubleshooting. If you got dad’s tractor stuck in a ditch, you better figure out how to get it unstuck before he got home. If you don’t take care of the chickens, they’ll die. That matters. On a farm you learned to innovate in a very rural way to make sure a job got finished. It might take baling wire and duct tape but the important thing was to improvise to finish the task until you could get the right part. It takes creativity, ingenuity and a sense of urgency. Those essential values are at the heart of our commercial real estate investors and what we do here at Allegiancy, innovating in the use of technology, counting on our experience and leveraging our Value Assurance process to ensure industry-leading profits and solid returns for our clients and investors.

Data-driven decisions lending peace of mind.






Proprietary Software Assists Commercial Real Estate Investors

Working with a national IT management consulting firm, Allegiancy developed a technology-enabled platform to gather, analyze and act on data compiled in real-time from its national portfolio of properties. Capturing data that most other firms in the industry aren’t even looking for, Allegiancy is able to act as vigilant, on-site managers to swiftly detect problems and solve them before they become costly big problems. The proprietary software system results in decisions executed within minutes rather than hours, days, or weeks, ensuring assets are managed with maximum profitability in mind and giving commercial real estate investors and building owners peace of mind.

Tech-enabled systems for peak efficiencies and savings.






Energy Control Benefits Assets Under Management

Working with a high-tech firm, Allegiancy designed and installed at its portfolio of properties cutting-edge, tech-enabled systems to capture power usage data in 15-minute increments. Opening a new frontier of efficiencies and cost-savings, the energy control system leads to savings measured in five- or six-figures annually that in turn drop straight to the bottom line of asset values. Analysts at Allegiancy offices in Richmond can monitor energy consumption at each of its assets under management, catching spikes in usage leading to management decisions that can include optimizing building wide heating and cooling models or investigating HVAC equipment issues. Problems are solved at buildings hundreds or thousands of miles away virtually as quickly as a building Allegiancy might manage in Richmond.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
