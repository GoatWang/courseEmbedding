FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)
FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation of the securities industry. They are not part of the government, but an independent, not-for-profit organization authorized by Congress to protect America’s investors by making sure the securities industry operates fairly and honestly. The do this by:

Writing and enforcing rules governing the activities of more than 4,025 securities firms with approximately 638,880 brokers
Examining firms for compliance with those rules
Fostering market transparency
Educating investors

FINRA’s independent regulation plays a critical role in America’s financial system—by enforcing high ethical standards, bringing the necessary resources and expertise to regulation and enhancing investor safeguards and market integrity—all at no cost to taxpayers.
Every investor in America relies on one thing: fair financial markets. That's why FINRA works every day to ensure that:

Every investor receives the basic protections they deserve
Anyone who sells a securities product has been tested, qualified and licensed
Every securities product advertisement used is truthful, and not misleading
Any securities product sold to an investor is suitable for that investor's needs
Investors receive complete disclosure about the investment product before purchase

SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation)
SIPC was created under the Securities Investor Protection Act as a non-profit membership corporation. SIPC oversees the liquidation of member broker-dealers that close when the broker-dealer is bankrupt or in financial trouble, and customer assets are missing. In a liquidation under the Securities Investor Protection Act, SIPC and the court-appointed Trustee work to return customers’ securities and cash as quickly as possible. Within limits, SIPC expedites the return of missing customer property by protecting each customer up to $500,000 for securities and cash (including a $250,000 limit for cash only).
SIPC is an important part of the overall system of investor protection in the United States. While a number of federal and state securities agencies and self-regulatory organizations deal with cases of investment fraud, SIPC's focus is both different and narrow: restoring customer cash and securities left in the hands of bankrupt or otherwise financially troubled brokerage firms.
