4.0 out of 5 starsGood Stephen King adaptation


      By
    
PJ Rankine

VINE VOICE on 22 Mar. 2010Format: DVD


  Confession - I haven't read the origninal short story upon which this is based so I can only imagine that this is a good adaptation of it because it is a good film unlike so many others that have been adapted from Mr King's excellent books.  Christian Slater is perfectly cast as the Dolan of the title; a sleezy heartless people trafficker, who commutes between Las Vegas and LA in his armoured Cadillac Escalade.  Wes Bentley plays the husband of a woman who is murdered by Dolan when she tries to give evidence against him.  The whole story then revolves around Bentley's search for justice and the ingenious way in which he achieves it.  As with many of King's novels you may not agree with the way its done but you'll cheer the end result.  As for the disc itself, the picture quality is excellent and probably the best I have seen this side of blu-ray.  The audio track is clear and dynamic and makes good use of the soundfield considering the type of film this is.  If you like Stephen King or just a good solid thriller then you'll probably enjoy this.

4.0 out of 5 starsA Stephen King adaptation that impresses

  Being a keen Stephen King reader, I am usually skeptical about adaptations of his work, having found that most movie/television versions fail to live up to the tensions wrought by King's unique style of storytelling.  However, at a purchase price under £3 it didn't seem like too much of a risk to take. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that not only had the script for "Dolan's Cadillac" been well written but that the additions put in to flesh out the story rounded out all the characters nicely.Christian Slater gives an excellent performance as the amoral Dolan, moving from in-control kingpin to a crazed man trapped by the husband of one of his victims.  Wes Bentley also pulls off a nicely understated performance as Robinson.  Admittedly there are points where staring vacuously is overdone, but on the whole it's a very enjoyable 85 minutes.  A must for any King film fans.The original story can be found in Stephen King's collection of short stories "Nightmares and Dreamscapes".  It's a different experience to the film as it takes much longer for the tension to build, but I recommend it for anyone who wants an alternate take on this film.

4.0 out of 5 starsHow can you argue at this price?

  At the time, I was looking for a movie just to sum up my basket price and I came along this Blu-Ray. At less than £3.00 brand new, I didn't take another glance, I bought it and watched it as soon as it arrived.I didn't expect it to be any good...but I was surprised. A fantastic revenge film. Though can get a bit claustrophobic which adds to  the atmosphere of the film.Though the blu-ray does have its faults...sometimes the movie can drag slightly, not many special features. Though the blu-ray transfer is rather good.If you like other Stephen King based movies, you'll like this one... You can tell its from the same person's mind...

4.0 out of 5 starsChristian Slater is awesome.

  Bought this to add to the collection as I had read the Stephen King short story. Found this to be a good interpretation of the book. The film goes into a lot more detail and back story than Stephen King's version (but then it was only a SHORT story), and gives the viewer a chance to get to know Elizabeth and therefore have a little more sympathy for her and her husband.Christian Slater does a great job as Dolan and is well cast, giving the character a more human quality, that despite how evil he was, made me feel a little sorry for him at the end.The film does take a while to hot up though and if you can make it through the first 45 mins, the rest is quite good, with the last half hour really tense. Well worth watching if you are a King fan or not,

4.0 out of 5 starsAn existential thriller deserving of a larger audience

  The film is based on a short story by Stephen KIng, but while the source is more concerned with the actual 'how' of the enterprise, the film takes its time to ask in much more detail, 'why'. As a result, the film feels far more accomplished than the source, offering at last a more plausible rationale for one man's descent into insanity coupled with a simple but very well made revenge film. Not as elaborate as Law Abiding Citizen say, but with the same hard heart I found myself enjoying this immensely.

3.0 out of 5 starsA rehashed Stephen King novella


      By
    
J. Morris

TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 26 April 2010Format: DVD


  Dolan's Cadillac is a solid thriller about a snakehead gangster (Christian Slater - Broken Arrow) who murders a witness after she sees his operation in the middle of the desert. Without a witness, Dolan goes free on the trafficking charges. The film is so named after the armoured car that Dolan heads his operation from, staying on the move. Wes Bentley (American Beauty) plays the husband of the recently deceased and is very, very upset about it all and vows to end Dolan's reign of terror.The film is well shot; some of the sunset vistas of the Vegas desert are breathtakingly beautiful, however it's all a distraction from what is essentially a short story that has been stretched into an 85-minute feature, at some points it really feels like the plot is being padded out (needlessly long shots of the Cadillac cruising the mile-straight desert roads etc). When the action is there, it is good and Slater provides a decent performance as Dolan. I was hoping for more from Wes Bentley as he really hasn't stolen the show since American Beauty but his character was a bit two-dimensional and he didn't bring anything new to the table with it.Nonetheless, a decent film worth a watch if you're long on time. DVD features the usual set of cast & crew interviews, an intriguing behind-the-scenes featurette and the B-Roll footage.
