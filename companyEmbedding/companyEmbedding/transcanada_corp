Keystone Pipeline[edit]
TransCanada maintains that people have public access to the pipeline, thus supporting criteria for eminent domain. "It's open for anyone to do business on our pipeline, we welcome business to our pipe." said TransCanada Media Relations Michael Barnes.[6]
At one point in October 2011, TransCanada was involved in up to 56 separate eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and South Dakota who have refused to give permission to the company to build the Keystone Pipeline on their land.[7] However, on August 23, 2012, Texas Judge Bill Harris ruled that TransCanada has the legal right of eminent domain and may lease or purchase land from owners who refused to sign an agreement with the company for the public right-of-way of a pipeline. The landowners had claimed that because the pipeline was not open to other companies, it did not meet the criteria for eminent domain.[8]
On September 27, 2012, protesters began tree sitting in the path of the Keystone pipeline near Winnsboro, Texas. Eight people stood on tree platforms just ahead of where crews were cutting down trees to make way for the pipeline.[9]
On October 4, 2012, actress and activist Daryl Hannah and 78-year-old Texas landowner Eleanor Fairchild were arrested for criminal trespassing and other charges after they were accused of standing in front of TransCanada pipeline construction equipment on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas.[10] Ms. Fairchild has owned the land since 1983 and refused to sign any agreements with TransCanada. Her land was seized by eminent domain.
On April 2, 2016, a resident near Freeman, South Dakota observed a leak along the Keystone pipeline. The size and cause were not immediately known.[11]
British Columbia gas export pipelines[edit]

As of June 2013 these projects remain subject to regulatory approval and licensing.[12][13]

In June 2012 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Shell and partners Korea Gas Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and PetroChina Company Limited to design, build, own and operate[13] the Coastal GasLink pipeline between northeastern B.C. oil fields near Dawson Creek, British Columbia and an LNG facility export facility on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia.[14][15][16][17]
In January 2013 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Petronas to design, build, own, and operate[12] the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project, a gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the Montney region near Fort St. John, British Columbia to a LNG terminal planned by Progress Energy Canada Ltd. in Port Edward, British Columbia on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.[18]
TransCanada's existing NGTL system in northeastern B.C. will be expanded and integrated into the new export pipeline systems.[12][14]
Pipelines in Alberta[edit]
In October 2012, TransCanada formed a 50-50 CAD$3bn joint-venture with Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. (the Canadian subsidiary of PetroChina) to develop the 500 km Grand Rapids Pipeline.[19]
Power market[edit]
TransCanada also owns, or has interests in, approximately 11,800 megawatts of power generation.[3]
Economic withholding[edit]
Economic withholding is defined as the practice of submitting blocks of electricity at high, non-competitive prices that effectively reduces or withholds the quantity of supply offered at competitive prices. Generators "offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid" but they raise the price so high the electricity is not dispatched.[20] In this way economic withholding is "an exercise of market power" which intentionally raise prices above competitive levels.[21]:5
In Alberta, Canada, through the practice of economic withholding a single electricity provider drove up prices on four occasions in May and June, of 2015 during a period of surplus power supply.[20]

Power generators are required to offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid, but they can choose the price they want for it. If it is priced too high, it might not be dispatched.
— Darcy Henton Calgary Herald 5 September 2015

A single market participant, TransCanadaEnergy Ltd successfully withheld "much of its available power output on four occasions in May and June 2015 despite there being a surplus supply of power. In response to concerns about the spike in the price of electricity TransCanada's Davis Sheremata claimed that the company "applies our view of prevailing market fundamentals when offering power into the wholesale market."[20]

Sponsorships[edit]
In 2014, Transcanada sponsored the Grand Final event held in Edmonton, Canada for the 2014 ITU World Triathlon Series.[24] In 2015 the company was a major sponsor for the 2015 World U-17 Hockey Challenge held in Dawson Creek and Fort St. John, British Columbia.[25] Transcanada committed $25,000 in sponsorship funding to assist the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the maintenance of the Iron Belle Trail. The company adopted a 2 kilometres (1 mile) long stretch of the trail in Kalkaska County, Michigan near an ANR Pipeline facility.[26]

Keystone Pipeline[edit]
TransCanada maintains that people have public access to the pipeline, thus supporting criteria for eminent domain. "It's open for anyone to do business on our pipeline, we welcome business to our pipe." said TransCanada Media Relations Michael Barnes.[6]
At one point in October 2011, TransCanada was involved in up to 56 separate eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and South Dakota who have refused to give permission to the company to build the Keystone Pipeline on their land.[7] However, on August 23, 2012, Texas Judge Bill Harris ruled that TransCanada has the legal right of eminent domain and may lease or purchase land from owners who refused to sign an agreement with the company for the public right-of-way of a pipeline. The landowners had claimed that because the pipeline was not open to other companies, it did not meet the criteria for eminent domain.[8]
On September 27, 2012, protesters began tree sitting in the path of the Keystone pipeline near Winnsboro, Texas. Eight people stood on tree platforms just ahead of where crews were cutting down trees to make way for the pipeline.[9]
On October 4, 2012, actress and activist Daryl Hannah and 78-year-old Texas landowner Eleanor Fairchild were arrested for criminal trespassing and other charges after they were accused of standing in front of TransCanada pipeline construction equipment on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas.[10] Ms. Fairchild has owned the land since 1983 and refused to sign any agreements with TransCanada. Her land was seized by eminent domain.
On April 2, 2016, a resident near Freeman, South Dakota observed a leak along the Keystone pipeline. The size and cause were not immediately known.[11]
British Columbia gas export pipelines[edit]

As of June 2013 these projects remain subject to regulatory approval and licensing.[12][13]

In June 2012 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Shell and partners Korea Gas Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and PetroChina Company Limited to design, build, own and operate[13] the Coastal GasLink pipeline between northeastern B.C. oil fields near Dawson Creek, British Columbia and an LNG facility export facility on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia.[14][15][16][17]
In January 2013 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Petronas to design, build, own, and operate[12] the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project, a gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the Montney region near Fort St. John, British Columbia to a LNG terminal planned by Progress Energy Canada Ltd. in Port Edward, British Columbia on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.[18]
TransCanada's existing NGTL system in northeastern B.C. will be expanded and integrated into the new export pipeline systems.[12][14]
Pipelines in Alberta[edit]
In October 2012, TransCanada formed a 50-50 CAD$3bn joint-venture with Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. (the Canadian subsidiary of PetroChina) to develop the 500 km Grand Rapids Pipeline.[19]
Power market[edit]
TransCanada also owns, or has interests in, approximately 11,800 megawatts of power generation.[3]
Economic withholding[edit]
Economic withholding is defined as the practice of submitting blocks of electricity at high, non-competitive prices that effectively reduces or withholds the quantity of supply offered at competitive prices. Generators "offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid" but they raise the price so high the electricity is not dispatched.[20] In this way economic withholding is "an exercise of market power" which intentionally raise prices above competitive levels.[21]:5
In Alberta, Canada, through the practice of economic withholding a single electricity provider drove up prices on four occasions in May and June, of 2015 during a period of surplus power supply.[20]

Power generators are required to offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid, but they can choose the price they want for it. If it is priced too high, it might not be dispatched.
— Darcy Henton Calgary Herald 5 September 2015

A single market participant, TransCanadaEnergy Ltd successfully withheld "much of its available power output on four occasions in May and June 2015 despite there being a surplus supply of power. In response to concerns about the spike in the price of electricity TransCanada's Davis Sheremata claimed that the company "applies our view of prevailing market fundamentals when offering power into the wholesale market."[20]

Sponsorships[edit]
In 2014, Transcanada sponsored the Grand Final event held in Edmonton, Canada for the 2014 ITU World Triathlon Series.[24] In 2015 the company was a major sponsor for the 2015 World U-17 Hockey Challenge held in Dawson Creek and Fort St. John, British Columbia.[25] Transcanada committed $25,000 in sponsorship funding to assist the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the maintenance of the Iron Belle Trail. The company adopted a 2 kilometres (1 mile) long stretch of the trail in Kalkaska County, Michigan near an ANR Pipeline facility.[26]

Tuscarora Gas Pipeline (491 km)

Keystone Pipeline[edit]
TransCanada maintains that people have public access to the pipeline, thus supporting criteria for eminent domain. "It's open for anyone to do business on our pipeline, we welcome business to our pipe." said TransCanada Media Relations Michael Barnes.[6]
At one point in October 2011, TransCanada was involved in up to 56 separate eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and South Dakota who have refused to give permission to the company to build the Keystone Pipeline on their land.[7] However, on August 23, 2012, Texas Judge Bill Harris ruled that TransCanada has the legal right of eminent domain and may lease or purchase land from owners who refused to sign an agreement with the company for the public right-of-way of a pipeline. The landowners had claimed that because the pipeline was not open to other companies, it did not meet the criteria for eminent domain.[8]
On September 27, 2012, protesters began tree sitting in the path of the Keystone pipeline near Winnsboro, Texas. Eight people stood on tree platforms just ahead of where crews were cutting down trees to make way for the pipeline.[9]
On October 4, 2012, actress and activist Daryl Hannah and 78-year-old Texas landowner Eleanor Fairchild were arrested for criminal trespassing and other charges after they were accused of standing in front of TransCanada pipeline construction equipment on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas.[10] Ms. Fairchild has owned the land since 1983 and refused to sign any agreements with TransCanada. Her land was seized by eminent domain.
On April 2, 2016, a resident near Freeman, South Dakota observed a leak along the Keystone pipeline. The size and cause were not immediately known.[11]
British Columbia gas export pipelines[edit]

As of June 2013 these projects remain subject to regulatory approval and licensing.[12][13]

In June 2012 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Shell and partners Korea Gas Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and PetroChina Company Limited to design, build, own and operate[13] the Coastal GasLink pipeline between northeastern B.C. oil fields near Dawson Creek, British Columbia and an LNG facility export facility on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia.[14][15][16][17]
In January 2013 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Petronas to design, build, own, and operate[12] the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project, a gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the Montney region near Fort St. John, British Columbia to a LNG terminal planned by Progress Energy Canada Ltd. in Port Edward, British Columbia on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.[18]
TransCanada's existing NGTL system in northeastern B.C. will be expanded and integrated into the new export pipeline systems.[12][14]
Pipelines in Alberta[edit]
In October 2012, TransCanada formed a 50-50 CAD$3bn joint-venture with Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. (the Canadian subsidiary of PetroChina) to develop the 500 km Grand Rapids Pipeline.[19]
Power market[edit]
TransCanada also owns, or has interests in, approximately 11,800 megawatts of power generation.[3]
Economic withholding[edit]
Economic withholding is defined as the practice of submitting blocks of electricity at high, non-competitive prices that effectively reduces or withholds the quantity of supply offered at competitive prices. Generators "offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid" but they raise the price so high the electricity is not dispatched.[20] In this way economic withholding is "an exercise of market power" which intentionally raise prices above competitive levels.[21]:5
In Alberta, Canada, through the practice of economic withholding a single electricity provider drove up prices on four occasions in May and June, of 2015 during a period of surplus power supply.[20]

Power generators are required to offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid, but they can choose the price they want for it. If it is priced too high, it might not be dispatched.
— Darcy Henton Calgary Herald 5 September 2015

A single market participant, TransCanadaEnergy Ltd successfully withheld "much of its available power output on four occasions in May and June 2015 despite there being a surplus supply of power. In response to concerns about the spike in the price of electricity TransCanada's Davis Sheremata claimed that the company "applies our view of prevailing market fundamentals when offering power into the wholesale market."[20]

Keystone Pipeline[edit]
TransCanada maintains that people have public access to the pipeline, thus supporting criteria for eminent domain. "It's open for anyone to do business on our pipeline, we welcome business to our pipe." said TransCanada Media Relations Michael Barnes.[6]
At one point in October 2011, TransCanada was involved in up to 56 separate eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and South Dakota who have refused to give permission to the company to build the Keystone Pipeline on their land.[7] However, on August 23, 2012, Texas Judge Bill Harris ruled that TransCanada has the legal right of eminent domain and may lease or purchase land from owners who refused to sign an agreement with the company for the public right-of-way of a pipeline. The landowners had claimed that because the pipeline was not open to other companies, it did not meet the criteria for eminent domain.[8]
On September 27, 2012, protesters began tree sitting in the path of the Keystone pipeline near Winnsboro, Texas. Eight people stood on tree platforms just ahead of where crews were cutting down trees to make way for the pipeline.[9]
On October 4, 2012, actress and activist Daryl Hannah and 78-year-old Texas landowner Eleanor Fairchild were arrested for criminal trespassing and other charges after they were accused of standing in front of TransCanada pipeline construction equipment on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas.[10] Ms. Fairchild has owned the land since 1983 and refused to sign any agreements with TransCanada. Her land was seized by eminent domain.
On April 2, 2016, a resident near Freeman, South Dakota observed a leak along the Keystone pipeline. The size and cause were not immediately known.[11]
British Columbia gas export pipelines[edit]

As of June 2013 these projects remain subject to regulatory approval and licensing.[12][13]

In June 2012 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Shell and partners Korea Gas Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and PetroChina Company Limited to design, build, own and operate[13] the Coastal GasLink pipeline between northeastern B.C. oil fields near Dawson Creek, British Columbia and an LNG facility export facility on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia.[14][15][16][17]
In January 2013 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Petronas to design, build, own, and operate[12] the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project, a gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the Montney region near Fort St. John, British Columbia to a LNG terminal planned by Progress Energy Canada Ltd. in Port Edward, British Columbia on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.[18]
TransCanada's existing NGTL system in northeastern B.C. will be expanded and integrated into the new export pipeline systems.[12][14]
Pipelines in Alberta[edit]
In October 2012, TransCanada formed a 50-50 CAD$3bn joint-venture with Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. (the Canadian subsidiary of PetroChina) to develop the 500 km Grand Rapids Pipeline.[19]
Power market[edit]
TransCanada also owns, or has interests in, approximately 11,800 megawatts of power generation.[3]
Economic withholding[edit]
Economic withholding is defined as the practice of submitting blocks of electricity at high, non-competitive prices that effectively reduces or withholds the quantity of supply offered at competitive prices. Generators "offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid" but they raise the price so high the electricity is not dispatched.[20] In this way economic withholding is "an exercise of market power" which intentionally raise prices above competitive levels.[21]:5
In Alberta, Canada, through the practice of economic withholding a single electricity provider drove up prices on four occasions in May and June, of 2015 during a period of surplus power supply.[20]

Power generators are required to offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid, but they can choose the price they want for it. If it is priced too high, it might not be dispatched.
— Darcy Henton Calgary Herald 5 September 2015

A single market participant, TransCanadaEnergy Ltd successfully withheld "much of its available power output on four occasions in May and June 2015 despite there being a surplus supply of power. In response to concerns about the spike in the price of electricity TransCanada's Davis Sheremata claimed that the company "applies our view of prevailing market fundamentals when offering power into the wholesale market."[20]

The company adopted a 2 kilometres (1 mile) long stretch of the trail in Kalkaska County, Michigan near an ANR Pipeline facility.[26]

					Full Description



TransCanada Corporation, incorporated on February 25, 2003, is an energy infrastructure company. The Company is engaged in the development and operation of North American energy infrastructure, including natural gas and liquids pipelines, power generation and natural gas storage facilities. Its segments include Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines, U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines, Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines, Liquids Pipelines and Energy. The Company operates in three businesses: Natural Gas Pipelines, Liquids Pipelines and Energy. The Natural Gas Pipelines and Liquids Pipelines segments principally consist of its respective natural gas and liquids pipelines in Canada, the United States and Mexico, as well as its regulated natural gas storage operations in the United States. The Energy segment includes its power operations and the non-regulated natural gas storage business in Canada. TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL) is its principal operating subsidiary.The Company's natural gas pipeline business builds, owns and operates a network of natural gas pipelines across North America that connects gas production to interconnects and end use markets. The network includes pipelines that are buried underground and transport natural gas predominantly under high pressure, compressor stations that act like pumps to move the large volumes of natural gas along the pipeline, meter stations that record the amount of natural gas coming on the network at receipt locations and leaving the network at delivery locations, and natural gas storage facilities that provide services to customers and help maintain the overall balance of the pipeline systems. Its natural gas pipeline network transports natural gas from supply basins to local distribution companies, power generation facilities, interconnecting pipelines and other businesses across Canada, the United States and Mexico. Its Natural Gas Pipelines business is split into three operating segments representing its geographic diversity: Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines, U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines and Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines. Its liquids pipeline infrastructure connects Alberta crude oil supplies to the United States refining markets in Illinois, Oklahoma and Texas, as well as connecting the United States crude oil supplies from the Cushing, Oklahoma hub to refining markets in the United States Gulf Coast.The Company's Energy business consists of three groups: Canadian Power, Natural Gas Storage (Canadian, non-regulated) and U.S. Power. The Company owns Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. (Columbia). As of December 31, 2016, Columbia operated a portfolio of approximately 24,500 kilometers (15,200 miles) of regulated natural gas pipelines, 285 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas storage facilities and related midstream assets. The Company also owns and manages Columbia's midstream services, which provide specific natural gas producer services, including gathering, treatment, conditioning, processing and liquids handling with a focus on the Appalachian Basin. As of December 31, 2016, it also owned a portfolio of capital growth projects, which included seven pipeline expansions designed to transport supply from the Marcellus/Utica production basins to markets. As of December 31, 2016, Columbia's natural gas storage business included 37 storage fields in four states and was integrated with the Columbia pipeline assets. The Company also operates and owns an interest in Hardy Storage, a natural gas storage field in Hardy and Hampshire counties in West Virginia.The Company owns and operates Columbia Gas interstate natural gas transportation pipeline and storage system, which operates as a means to transport gas from the Gulf Coast via Columbia Gulf, from various pipeline interconnects and from production areas in the Appalachian region to markets in the midwest, Atlantic and northeast regions. It owns and operates Columbia Gulf long-haul interstate natural gas transportation pipeline system that is designed to transport supply from the Gulf of Mexico to supply markets in the United States Northeast. The Company operates and owns an ownership interest in Millennium, which transports natural gas primarily sourced from the Marcellus shale to markets across southern New York and the lower Hudson Valley, as well as to the New York City market through its pipeline interconnections. The Company owns and operates Crossroads interstate natural gas pipeline operating in Indiana and Ohio. Its Midstream business provides natural gas producer services, including gathering, treating, conditioning, processing, compression and liquids handling in the Appalachian Basin.The Company's natural gas pipeline network transports natural gas from supply basins to local distribution companies, power generation facilities, interconnecting pipelines and other businesses. As of December 31, 2016, its network of pipelines tapped into supply basin and transported continental daily natural gas needs through wholly owned natural gas pipelines comprising 80,400 kilometers (50,000 miles) and partially-owned natural gas pipelines comprising 11,100 kilometers (6,900 miles). As of December 31, 2016, in addition to its interstate natural gas pipelines, the Company also had regulated natural gas storage facilities in the United States with a total working gas capacity of 535 Bcf.
