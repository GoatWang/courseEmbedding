The Journal Pen

Designed to fit into the spine binding of popular writing journals, check books and notepads, without impeding their function. Curved to fit with the curvature of the binding, yet flat so it does not catch clothing. Simple and with no moving parts, refillable, and available in hand diamond cut finish, hammered texture finish, and a very limited quantity of the prototype.

Description

Product Description
L. Richard is the Nam De Plume of South Korean artist born in Suncheon City September 16, 1957. The artist graduated from Maisan High School before challenging the rococo complexities of the eighteenth-century French masters. His bright skies and dexterity of brushwork echo the mastery of Freonard and his delicate ferns and flowers contrast beautifully with his trademark grapes and other robust, vivid fruits.
In addition to his elegance and technical virtuosity, the careful observer will note that each L. Richard original oil painting has small visual surprises tucked away in the painting filling every inch of his work with delight.
