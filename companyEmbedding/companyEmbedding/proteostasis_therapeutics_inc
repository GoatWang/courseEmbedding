					Full Description



Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc., incorporated on December 13, 2006, is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutics that treat diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network, a set of pathways that control protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and clearance. The Company has developed the Disease Relevant Translation (DRT) technology platform, a drug screening approach for identifying highly translatable therapeutics based on predictive and functionally pertinent phenotypic assays and disease relevant models. Using this platform, the Company has identified a new class of small molecules, amplifiers that modulate proteins in the proteostasis network. The Company's initial therapeutic focus is cystic fibrosis (CF) which is caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and insufficient CFTR protein function. The Company is developing and intend to commercialize its lead amplifier of CFTR protein, PTI-428, to improve CFTR protein function.PTI-428The Company's lead product candidate, PTI-428, is an orally bioavailable CFTR modulator belonging to the amplifier class. CFTR modulators are compounds that affect the folding, trafficking and clearance of CFTR protein and can be classified according to the ways, in which they affect CFTR protein. Amplifiers, which include PTI-428, are CFTR modulators that selectively increase the amount of an immature form of CFTR protein, thereby providing additional substrate for other CFTR modulators, such as correctors and potentiators, to act upon. Correctors, such as lumacaftor or VX-661, are known to improve protein folding and trafficking to enable abnormally folded CFTR protein to achieve some level of activity without repairing the actual protein. Potentiators, such as ivacaftor, are believed to increase the opening time of the CFTR protein channel resulting in higher ion flow across the cell membrane. PTI-428 is in clinical development.PTI-NC-733The Company's PTI-NC-733 is a combination of PTI-428 together with a corrector and a potentiator, which can achieve mechanistic synergy restoring in vitro CFTR protein activity to approximately 97% of normal in patient-derived Human Bronchial Epithelial (HBE) cells homozygous for F508del. Additionally, the combination of the corrector and potentiator in PTI-NC-733 has demonstrated superior in vitro efficacy compared to the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. The Company focuses to complete a preclinical safety and efficacy profile of PTI-NC-733.PTI-130The Company's PTI-130 is a small molecule amplifier that has been shown to enhance the function of normal and mutated CFTR in human CF patient-derived primary lung epithelial cell cultures in vitro. The Company's PTI-130 could be formulated for inhalation by means of commonly used inhalers and nebulizers. PTI-130 is in advanced stages of preclinical development and has been tested in safety and toxicology studies in rodent and non-rodent species as an orally formulated product.Partnered ProgramsThe Usp14 program is focused to enhance clearance of misfolded and damaged proteins, which is essential for maintaining normal protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, in cells. The Company's unfolded protein response (UPR) program is focused on developing therapies that modulate the cellular processes activated when proteins do not fold properly and is directed toward developing treatments for diseases caused by defects in protein folding, trafficking and clearance, which include neural and retinal degenerative disorders.The Company competes with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, AbbVie Inc., Galapagos NV, ProQR Therapeutics N.V., Nivalis Therapeutics, Inc., F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., Novartis AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Ampliphi Biosciences Corporation, Pfizer Inc., Parion Sciences, Inc., Genzyme Corporation, Bayer AG, Concert Pharmaceuticals Inc., Shire, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Orion Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline and Chiesi Farmaceutici.

Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Preliminary Data from Phase I Cystic Fibrosis Study
Jun 29 17
Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. has announced preliminary data from the Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) cohort of its Phase I trial designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of PTI-428 in CF, or cystic fibrosis, subjects. Safety and PK data from the first eight subjects who have completed dosing and follow-up were evaluated by the SRC. Primary endpoints of the study were safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK). Patients were randomized to receive 100 mg PTI-428 or placebo for seven days in addition to their background Orkambi therapy. PTI-428 was generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and no adverse events to discontinuation observed, and adverse events observed in subjects were mild (two) or moderate (one), and were deemed unrelated to study therapy. Preliminary data confirmed the PTI-428 PK profile to be comparable to that achieved in healthy volunteers and showed a lack of impact on Orkambi exposure levels, including both ivacaftor and lumacaftor, suggesting no clinically significant drug-drug interaction. Notably, peak concentration achieved approached EC90 for PTI-428. Safety endpoints included forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and exploratory endpoints included changes in sweat chloride (SC) and CFTR mRNA. Preliminary analysis of changes in respiratory function for those patients with complete lung function data over the study period indicates a positive trend from baseline to the end of the 7-day dosing period, as measured by FEV1, and return to baseline levels at the end of the 7-day follow up period. The overall changes in lung function during the treatment interval favored the group that received PTI-428 versus placebo, although such changes were not statistically significant, as the study was not designed to confirm difference from placebo. Preliminary sweat chloride data suggest that PTI-428 modulates CFTR activity. The alteration in SC is consistent with published data on lumacaftor and tezacaftor, where changes in SC levels did not correlate with FEV1 improvement. With a limited dataset, a correlation has not been observed between CFTR mRNA and FEV1. Further analysis of the study, including follow up on all patients enrolled in this cohort, is expected to be reported in July. For the cohort of CF patients not currently on CFTR modulator therapy, subjects received PTI-428, or placebo, as their sole CFTR modulator therapy for seven days. While this cohort remains blinded, of the five patients enrolled to date, four were evaluated by the SRC for safety and tolerability, and treatment was found to be generally well tolerated with no treatment related adverse events observed. Five adverse events observed so far were all mild. Further analysis from the PTI-428-only cohort, including follow up on all patients enrolled, is also expected to be reported in July. A separate study with a third patient population is initiating enrollment of CF patients who will receive PTI-428 or placebo in addition to Kalydeco as background therapy for 14 days. Proteostasis expects to announce preliminary results from this study during the third quarter. PTI-428 Data Support Progression into Phase II, 28-day Dosing Cohort, Progressing to Triple Combination (PTI-NC-733)After a washout period, patients on Orkambi background therapy who were enrolled in the 7-day dosing MAD cohort are eligible to enroll in the Phase II portion of the PTI-428 study, a 28-day dosing cohort. Upon review of the safety data from the MAD cohort in CF subjects on background Orkambi therapy, the SRC has approved initiation of this next stage of clinical development with PTI-428. The Company has initiated screening of patients for the 28-day study and plans to report safety and efficacy data from this cohort in Fourth Quarter of 2017.Proteostasis is currently conducting a 14-day MAD Phase I study of PTI-801 (corrector) in healthy volunteers in the US, to be followed by dosing in CF patients. If positive results are achieved in the Company's PTI-428 and PTI-801 programs, the Company intends to initiate a triple combination Proof of Concept (POC) study, which will combine PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 (also known as PTI-NC-733), in an F508del homozygous population who are not taking Orkambi, at the end of 2017. The study will explore different doses of PTI-808 with fixed dose combination of PTI-428 and PTI-801.


Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Clinical and Regulatory Progress Across Pipeline Programs
Jun 7 17
Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. announced updates across the Company’s later stage development programs in CF, including PTI-428, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator amplifier, PTI-801, a new generation CFTR corrector, and PTI-808, a CFTR potentiator. The updates were announced during the 40th European Cystic Fibrosis Society conference in Seville, Spain, where the Company is presenting detailed results from the single ascending dose cohort of its Phase 1 trial of PTI-428 in healthy volunteer and CF subjects, as well as its biobank and discovery of read-through molecules initiatives. PTI-428 Amplifier Clinical Data in Three Separate Populations of CF Patients on Track for Mid-Year: By the end of June, the company expects to report preliminary data, including lung function, from multiple ascending dose cohorts of two different CF patient populations: at least eight CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo in addition to Orkambi® as their background for seven days and up to eight CF subjects receiving PTI-428 as their sole CFTR modulator therapy or placebo for seven days. Lung function, as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV 1, is being assessed, as well as changes in sweat chloride. Underscoring rising momentum in the program, expanded data from four additional subjects in each arm is anticipated next month. After a washout period, patients on Orkambi® background therapy who were enrolled in the 7-day dosing MAD cohort are eligible to enroll in a 28-day clinical study for PTI-428, which is expected to start at the end of June. This longer duration study of CF subjects already on standard Orkambi® background therapy is expected to generate safety and efficacy data from up to 20 subjects, with the goal of identifying a dose level for the triple combination proof of concept (POC) combining PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 (known as PTI-NC-733). The company is studying PTI-428 in multiple CF populations because in vitro studies indicate it is agnostic to CF genotype. Results from a separate study in a third patient population, where CF patients will receive PTI-428 or placebo in addition to Kalydeco as background therapy for 14 days, is expected in the third quarter. PTI-801 New Generation Corrector Phase 1 Healthy Volunteer SAD Study Complete; MAD Study Underway: the company announced the completion of the healthy volunteer, SAD portion of its Phase 1 study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of PTI-801. A 14-day MAD portion in healthy volunteers is underway in the U.S., with results from both study portions to be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting. Safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy data from CF subjects on background Orkambi therapy is expected in the second half of 2017. The goal of this study is to identify a dose level for the triple combination POC combining PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808. PTI-808 Potentiator Advancing to IND; DRF Study Intended to be POC for Triple Combination by Year End 2017: As previously announced, Proteostasis expects to submit an Investigational New Drug application for PTI-808, its CFTR potentiator, to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of this month; the Company plans to initiate a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers in July. If the Company receives positive results from its PTI-428 and PTI-801 programs, the Company intends to initiate a dose range finding (DRF) study at the end of 2017 in an F508del homozygous population who are not taking Orkambi®. The study design is expected to include DRF of PTI-808 with fixed dose combination of PTI-428 and PTI-801. The DRF study with PTI-808 is also intended to be considered a POC study for the triple combination.


Proteostasis Mulls Acquisitions
Jun 7 17
Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. (NasdaqGM:PTI) is looking for acquisitions. The company which is on the verge of sale of securities, intends to use the portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to its own business.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.74      Net Money Flow ($)  -46,906    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Proteostasis Therapeutics Files Investigational New Drug Application  for PTI-808, Cystic Fibrosis Potentiator



June 23, 2017 at 7:00 AM EDT


CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June  23, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTI), a biopharmaceutical company developing small molecule therapeutics to treat diseases caused by dysfunctional protein processing such as cystic fibrosis (CF), today announced that the Company has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PTI-808, its cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator. Proteostasis plans to initiate a Phase 1 study of PTI-808 in healthy volunteers in July.   
“While potentiators are an established part of CF therapy, there remains significant room for improvement in this critical component of therapy, and we believe PTI-808, with potential once a day dosing regimen, offers the potential to fill this gap,” said Meenu Chhabra, president and chief executive officer of Proteostasis Therapeutics. “Each component of our potential triple combination therapy is now clinical stage, with active and ongoing clinical development programs for both PTI-428, an amplifier, and PTI-801, a new generation corrector.  With the filing of an IND for the potentiator PTI-808, the third and final piece of our triple combination, we have reached an important milestone in assembling PTI-NC-733.  Pending positive results from ongoing clinical trials with PTI-428 and PTI-801, we expect to initiate a trial combining all three proprietary CFTR modulators before the end of 2017.”
By the end of June, Proteostasis expects to report preliminary data from multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts of two different CF patient populations: CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo in addition to Orkambi® as their background therapy for seven days and CF subjects receiving PTI-428 as their sole CFTR modulator therapy or placebo for seven days.  After a washout period, patients on Orkambi® background therapy who were enrolled in the 7-day dosing MAD cohort are eligible to enroll in a 28-day clinical study for PTI-428.
Proteostasis is currently conducting a 14-day MAD Phase 1 study of PTI-801 in healthy volunteers in the U.S., to be followed by dosing in CF patients.  If positive results are achieved in the Company’s PTI-428 and PTI-801 programs, Proteostasis intends to initiate a dose range finding (DRF) study at the end of 2017 in an F508del homozygous population who are not taking Orkambi®. The study design is expected to include DRF of PTI-808 with fixed dose combination of PTI-428 and PTI-801 in a triple combination also known as PTI-NC-733.
About Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc.
