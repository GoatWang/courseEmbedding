 NIAF Provides Italian American Students the Opportunity to Visit Italy 
 Vince Liuzzi serves as the EVP and chief banking officer at DNB First, a successful community bank. Outside of his career, Vincent Liuzzi supports several charitable organizations, including the National Italian American Foundation, which preserves the heritage of America’s fifth largest ethnic group, Italian Americans.  Recently, the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) granted 20 U.S. college students with Italian roots entry into the Ambassador Peter F. Secchia Voyage of Discovery Program. The program provides students with an all-expense-paid trip to Italy, helping them learn more about the country, its culture, and their own heritage. This recent group of students will visit the Campania region, which the NIAF had named its 2014 Region of Honor.  The program, which is 15 years old, takes students through a 14-day tour of Italy. Students tour various historic sites throughout the area, including Palazzo Reale and Capella San Severo, and as well as the Royal Palace and a local silk factory. The trip’s schedule also includes a visit to Mount Vesuvius and the ruins of Pompeii, along with several other activities. The NIAF finances the entire trip, including meals, tours, transfers, accommodations, and round-trip airfare. 




 Benefits of Taking Out a Mortgage from a Bank vs. a Mortgage Company 
 As the executive vice president and chief banking officer of DNB  First Bank, Vince Liuzzi develops and implements strategic plans for the  bank's mortgage lending, personal banking, and other business lines.  Vincent Liuzzi strives to create multi-service relationships to meet  customers' diverse and changing banking needs.  When shopping for a  mortgage, most customers have the choice between a bank and a mortgage  company. Banks offer a number of advantages in this situation,  particularly for customers with stable financial records. Banks often  offer baseline interest rates that are competitive with mortgage  companies and others in the industry, as competition for borrowers tends  to affect lenders across the board. However, because a bank is  competing with other lenders for its customers' business, it may use the  person's financial history and knowledge of his or her needs to offer a  more attractive package.  Banks may offer a customer special  consideration for needs that may not concern a more impersonal lender.  For example, a borrower with recently accrued education debt could be  considered a risk to a large mortgage broker, whereas the same person's  community bank may see this as an investment in his or her future and  offer a better rate. The bank can also explain the details and  terminology used in the mortgage process and present information in a  way that is not only understandable but also helpful to the borrower in  making decisions.  




 ALR-LRI Cooperative Project Rapidly Advancing Lupus Research 
 As EVP and chief banking officer for DNB First, Vince Liuzzi is responsible for directing and developing strategies for the company. Outside of work, Vince Liuzzi supports a wide variety of charitable and humanitarian organizations, one of which is the Alliance for Lupus Research.  Recently, the Alliance for Lupus Research (ALR), a national voluntary health organization, released a statement regarding the recent success of its cooperative project with the Lupus Research Institute (LRI).  Started in order to fast-track scientific analysis and the discovery of new lupus treatments, the cooperative project between ALR and LRI has analyzed over 150 potential therapies from a group of 6,800. These results will be reviewed by an expert committee before being tested in clinical trials.  The project welcomes the input of the lupus community, accepting ideas, input, and comments through LRxL STAT, its dedicated LinkedIn site. Both organizations are extremely happy with the rapid progress made by the project so far, and are confident their cooperation will see new advances in the field of lupus research and treatment not yet discovered. 




 NIAF Gives Large Grant to University of Maryland Classics Department 
 Veteran senior executive leader, Vince Liuzzi serves as EVP and Chief Banking Officer with DNB First - the oldest national bank in the Philadelphia region.  Outside  of his career, Vincent Liuzzi takes part in a number of charity  organizations, including the National Italian American Foundation.   The  National Italian American Foundation is a non-profit educational entity  dedicated to preserving and promoting Italian American culture. Founded  in 1975, the objectives of the National Italian American Foundation  include advancing relations between the United States and Italy in  business and culture and working to be a voice for Italian Americans  politically.   In February of 2014, the National Italian American  Foundation presented a grant for $500,000 to the University of Maryland.  This award, the largest single grant in the foundation's history, came  from one of the Foundation's donors, the late Ernest L. Pellegri, for  use by the University's Department of Classics. The funds will support  scholarship in Latin and ancient Roman archeology and civilization as  well as study abroad and research in Italy.  For more information  about this grant and the National Italian American Foundation's other  programs, visit the group online at www.niaf.org.  




 Must-See Sites in Puerto Rico
 Puerto Rico remains one of the most accessible island vacation  destinations for Americans. Visitors have access to a wide range of  exciting sites, from historically significant forts to natural wonders.  One of the most unique attractions is the Vieques Biobay, one of the few  bioluminescent bays in the world. Tiny microorganisms in the water glow  upon contact, making fish streak by in splashes of light and boats’  oars glow in shades of green as they move through the water.  Visitors  should also check out El Yunque, a tropical rainforest that takes only  two hours to reach by car from San Juan. The forest boasts a major  waterfall and trails of varying difficulty for all levels of hikers.  History  buffs will want to see the Castillo de San Felipe del Morro, also known  simply as El Morro. A six-level citadel, El Morro protected Old San  Juan from attack. The city served as one of the most important ports  between Europe and the Americas. Visitors can see cannons that were  actually in use and learn how soldiers at the fortress would have lived.

Vince Liuzzi: An Experienced Community Banker And Relationship Builder



Posted By: Ken KnickerbockerPosted date: May 14, 2015
From coast to coast and finally to Downingtown, Vince Liuzzi, EVP and Chief Banking Officer of Downingtown-based DNB Financial, has worked in banking and consumer credit since he was a high school Senior in San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles.
The son of an aerospace contract engineer, Liuzzi’s career took off in his twenties when a manager identified he had a natural talent to motivate and develop people. He quickly rose through the ranks from branch manager, district manager, community bank president and then to Philadelphia regional president, all for Wells Fargo and its affiliates.
In a move designed to enhance the bank’s profitability, market share and growth, DNB recruited Liuzzi  in the Fall of 2013. As a community bank headquartered in Downingtown with 13 locations in Chester and Delaware County, DNB is the oldest national bank in the Philadelphia region.
If DNB’s 2014 performance is any indication, Liuzzi’s impact on DNB’s bottom line and operations has been immediate. In his first full year, DNB’s net income and total stockholders’ equity grew 23 percent and 9 percent respectively. Just as important, according to Chairman and CEO Bill Latoff, DNB became a “better integrated organization with a stronger sales culture.”
Vince Liuzzi spoke to VISTA Today last week about growing up in California, learning the ropes of community banking, and what the move to DNB First means for him, the community, and Chester County’s community bank’s future.
VISTA Today: Let’s start at the beginning. Where did you grow up Vince?
Vince Liuzzi: I was born and raised Los Angeles in California. My dad was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey and moved to Los Angeles as a young boy with his family in the 1940’s. My grandfather was very community minded and entrepreneurial, he was a small business owner. Before opening up a barber shop that he owned for many years into retirement, he had a small ice cream parlor and then a fruit and nuts shop. When he became a barber, he built up his business cutting the hair of a lot of TV or movie actors in the Sherman Oaks area. Eventually, he became known as the “Barber to the Stars.”
I grew up in a big Italian community and went to Catholic grade school and high school. The area where we lived was dominated by the aerospace industry at the time.
VT: How did you get into banking?
VL: In 1983, when I was a senior in high school, I enrolled in a banking internship program, sponsored by Security Pacific National Bank. The experience gave me a chance to experience the different functions of working in a bank branch; teller, proof and cash box, new accounts, loans, everything. After high school, I got my first full time banking job at Security Pacific National Bank Consumer Credit Department in Chatsworth.
VT: What did you take from that first job you still remember today?
VL: The experience as an intern and then regular employee at Security Pacific was an important, foundational experience for me. Because I did a little of everything in the bank, I experienced all the various components of banking.   I learned the importance of customer service, client segmentation and gained a deeper understanding of consumer behaviors and how the financial services business supports growth, consumer asset management and wealth building.
After graduating from high school, I began college at Cal-State Northridge while working part time in Security Pacific’s’ Consumer Credit department.   I left Security Pacific in 1985 to take a Consumer Credit Manager position with May Company (now Macy’s) department store. The experience in consumer credit proved to be invaluable. At May I learned much about consumer credit, how to underwrite and process revolving credit, how to make credit decisions and help clients succeed, skills that I rely on today leading DNB First’s consumer credit group.
VL: How long did you stay at May Company?
Vince & Jackie Liuzzi
VL: About five years. I took a break from school, got married, had kids and progressed further into financial services. I worked as a securities broker for a couple of years then took a job as a branch manager for Wells Fargo Bank during a period of rapid growth and expansion in 1996. I quickly advanced and was promoted to District Manager, Community Bank President and then to Regional President for Wells Fargo.
While I was working my way up Wells Fargo’s ladder, I resumed my education, earning my Graduate Certificate in Banking from Pacific Coast Banking School at the University of Washington.
My position at Wells Fargo gave me the opportunity to gain experience in a community bank region managing a geography of traditional and in-store branches throughout New Mexico.
My geography covered half the state, and gave me a chance to learn a lot about community banking. In my role, I dealt with a lot of ranchers, agricultural lending clients, and small businesses. I was responsible for some very small communities that had just 500 people as well as large metropolitan and suburban areas with tens of thousands of people. I saw and experienced it all.
VT: Did someone see something in you during this time that helped advance your career?
VL: Yes! I’ll never forget Becky Jackson, my very first District Manager at Wells Fargo Bank. She hired me as a forward hire branch manager responsible to manage a group of supermarket branches that were in a period of rapid growth. My role was to open a branch, hire and train the staff, do the grand opening and then move on to the next branch. Becky saw my ability to coach, motivate, develop and inspire people, customers and communities. She also promoted me to the leadership role in New Mexico, where I learned so much about community banking. I didn’t realize how flattering her praise was at the time, but it’s an ability I’ve leveraged many times over my career.
VT: Close the loop Vince. What brought you to DNB?
VL: I was working as Wells Fargo’s Greater Philadelphia Regional President. When I first came to Philadelphia in 2009, I met Bill Latoff, DNB’s Chairman and CEO. We became friendly, saw each other at community events and served on a number of committees together. This was during a time when Wells Fargo and Wachovia were going through a significant merger. Wells Fargo’s management was concerned about the Philadelphia market’s reaction to the merger. As a result, I spent a lot of time building key relationships in Philadelphia, the suburbs and the State of Delaware.
DNB First branch in East Goshen
During this period, Bill and I started talking about what he was doing at DNB First and what I wanted to do in my career. Bill was looking for an executive with proven banking leadership experience who knew how to work at a community level. Bill and I stayed in touch over a couple of years and in the third quarter of 2013, I made the decision to join DNB.
VT: Looking into the rest of 2015 what challenges do you see for you and DNB?
VL: I see a lot of opportunities. We had great growth in 2014 on the consumer side of our business. Going forward I see an opportunity to grow our small business segment and further develop our commercial banking relationships. Our culture is very entrepreneurial and built to react quickly to the needs of the community. We rolled out a number of new products and services in the last 12 months and have a lot of upside.
VT: You’re on the record as wanting to grow the business and commercial side of the business. What are your plans?
VL: Just this month we made an announcement to open a new division of DNB First we call the Business Banking Services division. We now have professional relationship managers, specialists and a breadth of products designed to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes. For example, we recently introduced payroll services and specialized loans to help smaller businesses manage their finances. We also offer robust cash management services and loans to meet the needs of commercial businesses.
(From left to right) Vince Liuzzi; Carolyn Comitta, Mayor of West Chester; Lieutenant Maria Corraliza, the Salvation Army.
VT: DNB is known for being involved in the communities it serves. Why is community involvement so important to DNB?
VL: We not only support the needs of the individuals and businesses within our communities, but also believe in giving back to the communities we serve through sponsorships, donations and employee volunteers.
We are proud to support numerous local causes and non-profit organizations, including the United Way. I have been involved personally in United Way for many, many years. As a DNB management team, we get involved in United Way because it’s part of our mission to help the communities we serve be successful. The United Way provides tremendous resources and support for people who are in the most need.
I like the United Way because our employees can direct where their donated funds will benefit. DNB has been an award winner for employee participation, indicating our employees share our passion for both the United Way and the communities we serve.
VT: Finally Vince, what is the best piece of advice you ever received?
VL: My grandfather told me to work hard and to be committed to your business and company. I saw my grandfather’s and father’s work ethic first hand and its something I want to pass on to my children.
