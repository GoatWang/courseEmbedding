Josef Vejvoda

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Josef Vejvoda (born 13 July 1945, Prague, Czechoslovakia) is a Czech composer,[1] percussionist, conductor and bandleader.
His first notable appearance took place in 1963, when he performed with Jiří Stivín's Jazztet at the Theatre on the Balustrade. In 1967, he was awarded Laureate of the Prague Jazz International Contest of Young Soloists. He graduated from Prague Conservatory in 1970.
He recorded albums with Karel Velebný's SHQ, with the Big Band of the Český rozhlas (Czech Radio), with Laco Déczi, with Emil Viklický, as well as with several musicians from abroad. A Meeting To Build A Dream On, an album with recording of a performance with Benny Bailey at the Přerov Jazz Festival,[2] was awarded The Best Jazz Album of 2001 by the Český rozhlas.
In 2002, on the centenary of Jaromír Vejvoda, he conducted his father's Beer Barrel Polka at Carnegie Hall.[3][4]
Vejvoda is married and has two daughters. One of them, Monika Šterbáková-Vejvodová, is a conductor; the other daughter, Zuzana Vejvodová, became an actress.

It’s easy to be green: Jewellery to put spring into your stepTraditionally speaking, the spring season is known for bringing forth a sense of growth and renewal. And while last year proved challenging for many retailers, beleaguered jewellers can perhaps take some solace in knowing that this season offers new opportunities. 









Profile: Myles Mindham celebrating 25 yearsWalking up the shrub-lined path towards the entrance of his three-story Hazelton Avenue townhouse located in Toronto’s prestigious Yorkville neighbourhood, visitors are greeted by an enchanting garden strewn with magical metal creatures beckoning them into the beguiling showroom oasis where Myles Mindham awaits. 




Unbridled passion: Designing for the happy coupleThe sheer bliss of designing for a happy couple is enough to make you start thinking about developing your own bridal collection. And let’s be honest, it can be a lucrative segment of the jewellery industry, as couples are often willing to invest in this monumental milestone.

Shop talk: Making the most of mobile in your retail businessThree-quarters of all Canadians have a smartphone or mobile device. As you would expect, this radically impacts retail businesses. Shoppers use mobile devices to discover and research designers, brands, and products prior to making purchases.
