   John Stuart Edwards - Capitol Hellway         Search for:     Capitol HellwayA Free Media Company in the 21st Century    John Stuart Edwards  John Stuart Edwards, a.k.a. Johnny, is an American writerWRITING PROJECTS Author –  Johnny is writing a fictional novel for publication in 2018 that is based on some of his experiences working for government parasites inside the Capital Beltway. The novel examines whistleblower retaliation through the lens of Johnny’s fantasies about American justice and government accountability.Freelance Writer – Johnny is writing a federal technology spending manifesto to show U.S. taxpayers how Congress and the President can easily cut $500 Billion in wasteful spending from the federal discretionary budget. The manifesto is a strategic plan for U.S. federal technology assets and investments that creates a government that is far more secure, works better and costs a fraction of what it costs today to operate. Johnny admits, “There is only one obstacle to eliminating fraudulent and wasteful spending by the United States federal government. It is the long-tenured career bureaucrats in Washington D.C. that spend taxpayer funds and retaliate against whistleblowers. Power over money at all costs. These are people that view abuse of authority and deceit as something less than murder, so it’s ok. These are also the people that need to be eliminated from the U.S. federal government by any means necessary. They need to be exposed and destroyed. An eye for an eye.”The manifesto is based on thirteen years investigative research that Johnny performed until June 2017 inside eight different U.S. federal government agencies including Defense, Homeland Security, and Labor. Read more about Johnny’s research here and read his biography here.And on a topic of great personal interest inside the realm of theoretical physics, Johnny is writing a paper that he believes explains the existence of God and the role of God in the universe. Johnny talks about his theory using an empty paper towel roll with a few scribbles on it to illustrate two different views of time and matter.Journalist –  In July 2017, Johnny began writing a series of articles to cast sunlight on the corrupt and morally bankrupt federal government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. that retaliated against him during his research inside their agencies. Coming in August 2017 U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis (1856-1941) said, “Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.”Under the ‘law of retaliation,’ a person who has injured another person must be penalized to a similar degree. An eye for an eye.  Johnny’s investigative series on whistleblower retaliation will explore many topics:How firing a fed is easy when the employee is a whistleblower.The torturous destruction of a whistleblower’s life and the resurrection.Why U.S. Presidents, the Congress and the Washington D.C. media do not hold U.S. government bureaucrats accountable when they retaliate against whistleblowers.Whistleblowers are an anomaly that threaten power and popularity in Washington D.C.Can you name one ‘whistleblower retaliator’ in the U.S. federal government who was fired or imprisoned for destroying a whistleblower’s life?Why are Whistleblowers an endangered species in the U.S. federal government?Who are the ‘whistleblower retaliators’ that should be fired or imprisoned? An eye for an eye whistleblower retaliation law is needed. It will be the best tool for citizens to protect their rights.  Johnny’s articles are based on thoroughly documented and substantiated research and evidence such as audio recordings, videos, government correspondence, emails, court records, Freedom of Information Act requests, Inspector General and other internal agency reports. Johnny meticulously tagged these artifacts with the keyword “follies” when he worked inside the government for easy retrieval, and he collected and stored the evidence in secure online repositories that will be shared with the American public for the first time.  If any of this interests you… please contact me.Capitol Hellway Media CompanyA Free Media Company in the 21st Century

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Client Review Ratings and/or Peer Review Ratings may not be available for all firms and/or lawyers and the fact that a firm or lawyer has not been reviewed should not be construed as unfavorable.
