Life and Education[edit]
Otto-Bernstein (née Otto) was born in Hamburg, Germany, the youngest daughter of German industrialist Werner Otto[2] (Crate & Barrel) and his third wife Maren. She has four siblings: Michael Otto, Ingvild Goetz, Alexander Otto and Frank Otto.
After attending St. Clare’s Hall in Oxford, England, Otto-Bernstein moved to New York to study philosophy and political science at Columbia College (BA) and received her MGA in screenwriting and directing from Columbia University Film School.
Otto-Bernstein is married to New York art dealer Nathan A. Bernstein. They have two children: Nicholas and Jonathan.
Career[edit]
As an undergraduate Otto-Bernstein worked for Town & Country magazine and wrote a lifestyle column for German Vogue. In 1989, she was hired by British director Don Boyd (Aria, Twenty-One, My Kingdom) to work on the East-West thriller entitled The Berlin Project. Once the production crew arrived in the divided capital, Otto-Bernstein became a witness to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the unification of East and West Germany. This gave Otto-Bernstein the incentive to direct the television documentary, Coming Home (1990), dealing with the re-unification of German families, and compile the interview collection, In the Shadow of the Wall, featuring interviews with East German personalities, including intelligence agents Günter Guillaume, Horst Hesse, and the Soviet spy Ruth Kuczynski (Red Sonja).
Upon her return to the US, Otto-Bernstein directed the comedy, The Second Greatest Story Ever Told (1992), starring Mira Sorvino and Malcolm McDowell; the television documentary, The Need for Speed (1993); and the American segments of the documentaries When Night Falls Over Moscow - Arms Dealing in the Former Soviet Union and The Industrialists Hall of Fame (1993). In 1994, she founded the production company Film Manufacturers Inc. (FMI).
Otto-Bernstein's Beautopia premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 1998.[3] The film probes the dark side of modeling and features fashion icons such as Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Valentino Garavani, Karl Lagerfeld, and Calvin Klein. Beautopia was the Grand Prize Nominee at Sundance and won the Silver Hugo at the Chicago International Film Festival.[4] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the film “a terrific and lively feminist analysis.”[5]
In 1998, Otto-Bernstein met American theatre and opera director Robert Wilson (Einstein on the Beach, Black Rider, Lohengrin) at a cocktail party.[6] This marked the beginning of a seven-year collaboration on the internationally acclaimed biopic, Absolute Wilson. The film features prominent collaborators such as Philip Glass, David Byrne, Tom Waits, Jessye Norman, and literary icon Susan Sontag in one of her last interviews. Absolute Wilson premiered to great critical acclaim at the 2006 Berlin International Film Festival[7] and became an international festival sensation, earning the prestigious Art Film of the Year award from Art Basel. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote in his review: “An artist who operates on such a groundbreaking, international level as Robert Wilson deserves a documentary as good as Absolute Wilson.”[8] A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted: “ Absolute Wilson makes you wish you had been there. Ms. Otto-Bernstein has performed heroic work."[9]
In 2006, Otto-Bernstein published Absolute Wilson: The Biography (Prestel, Random House). She also penned the chapter “Absolute Watermill” for The Watermill Center – Robert Wilson’s Legacy (2011, Daco-Verlag, Stuttgart), and her short story "Dog Days" appeared in the book No Better Friend: Celebrities and the Dogs They Love, a collection of intimate essays edited by Elke Gazzara.[10]
In October 2012, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Otto-Bernstein's Film Manufacturers Inc. is co-producing the German language thriller, Galapagos, together with KJ Entertainment.[11] The film, written by Kathrin Lohmann and Katharina Otto-Bernstein, is based on Margret Wittmer's autobiography, Floreana: A Woman’s Pilgrimage to the Galapagos, and will be helmed by Marc Rothemund (Academy Award nomination for Sophie Scholl: The Final Days).[12][13]
In 2013, Otto-Bernstein served as dramaturge on choreographer Karole Armitage's (Tony Award nomination for Hair) ballet, Fables for Global Warming.[14]
In 2016, Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures, the first definitive, feature length portrait of the controversial American artist Robert Mapplethorpe, produced by Otto-Bernstein, premiered at Sundance Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival to rave reviews.[15] The film had its TV premiere on HBO on April 4, 2016 and is currently being released theatrically all over the world. Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures was nominated for two Emmy Awards: Outstanding Documentary Or Nonfiction Special and Outstanding Cinematography For A Nonfiction Program.
Other Interests[edit]
Otto-Bernstein is currently serving her 15th year on the Dean's Council of Columbia University School of the Arts as well as spearheading the Film Department’s thesis mentor program. She was honored by her Alma Mater with the prestigious Columbia University Alumni Medal in 2009.[16] In 2012, Otto-Bernstein donated a state-of-the-art screening room at Columbia University's Lenfest Center for the Arts, designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano.[17]
Otto-Bernstein is a trustee and advisory director of the Metropolitan Opera, a member of the International Director’s Council of the Guggenheim Museum, and has served in the past as a trustee of the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Animal Legal Defense Fund. She actively supports a variety of social and cultural causes that foster sustainable and humane practices, and promote freedom of expression and peaceful co-existence throughout the world.

Life and Education[edit]
Otto-Bernstein (née Otto) was born in Hamburg, Germany, the youngest daughter of German industrialist Werner Otto[2] (Crate & Barrel) and his third wife Maren. She has four siblings: Michael Otto, Ingvild Goetz, Alexander Otto and Frank Otto.
After attending St. Clare’s Hall in Oxford, England, Otto-Bernstein moved to New York to study philosophy and political science at Columbia College (BA) and received her MGA in screenwriting and directing from Columbia University Film School.
Otto-Bernstein is married to New York art dealer Nathan A. Bernstein. They have two children: Nicholas and Jonathan.
Career[edit]
As an undergraduate Otto-Bernstein worked for Town & Country magazine and wrote a lifestyle column for German Vogue. In 1989, she was hired by British director Don Boyd (Aria, Twenty-One, My Kingdom) to work on the East-West thriller entitled The Berlin Project. Once the production crew arrived in the divided capital, Otto-Bernstein became a witness to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the unification of East and West Germany. This gave Otto-Bernstein the incentive to direct the television documentary, Coming Home (1990), dealing with the re-unification of German families, and compile the interview collection, In the Shadow of the Wall, featuring interviews with East German personalities, including intelligence agents Günter Guillaume, Horst Hesse, and the Soviet spy Ruth Kuczynski (Red Sonja).
Upon her return to the US, Otto-Bernstein directed the comedy, The Second Greatest Story Ever Told (1992), starring Mira Sorvino and Malcolm McDowell; the television documentary, The Need for Speed (1993); and the American segments of the documentaries When Night Falls Over Moscow - Arms Dealing in the Former Soviet Union and The Industrialists Hall of Fame (1993). In 1994, she founded the production company Film Manufacturers Inc. (FMI).
Otto-Bernstein's Beautopia premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 1998.[3] The film probes the dark side of modeling and features fashion icons such as Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Valentino Garavani, Karl Lagerfeld, and Calvin Klein. Beautopia was the Grand Prize Nominee at Sundance and won the Silver Hugo at the Chicago International Film Festival.[4] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the film “a terrific and lively feminist analysis.”[5]
In 1998, Otto-Bernstein met American theatre and opera director Robert Wilson (Einstein on the Beach, Black Rider, Lohengrin) at a cocktail party.[6] This marked the beginning of a seven-year collaboration on the internationally acclaimed biopic, Absolute Wilson. The film features prominent collaborators such as Philip Glass, David Byrne, Tom Waits, Jessye Norman, and literary icon Susan Sontag in one of her last interviews. Absolute Wilson premiered to great critical acclaim at the 2006 Berlin International Film Festival[7] and became an international festival sensation, earning the prestigious Art Film of the Year award from Art Basel. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote in his review: “An artist who operates on such a groundbreaking, international level as Robert Wilson deserves a documentary as good as Absolute Wilson.”[8] A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted: “ Absolute Wilson makes you wish you had been there. Ms. Otto-Bernstein has performed heroic work."[9]
In 2006, Otto-Bernstein published Absolute Wilson: The Biography (Prestel, Random House). She also penned the chapter “Absolute Watermill” for The Watermill Center – Robert Wilson’s Legacy (2011, Daco-Verlag, Stuttgart), and her short story "Dog Days" appeared in the book No Better Friend: Celebrities and the Dogs They Love, a collection of intimate essays edited by Elke Gazzara.[10]
In October 2012, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Otto-Bernstein's Film Manufacturers Inc. is co-producing the German language thriller, Galapagos, together with KJ Entertainment.[11] The film, written by Kathrin Lohmann and Katharina Otto-Bernstein, is based on Margret Wittmer's autobiography, Floreana: A Woman’s Pilgrimage to the Galapagos, and will be helmed by Marc Rothemund (Academy Award nomination for Sophie Scholl: The Final Days).[12][13]
In 2013, Otto-Bernstein served as dramaturge on choreographer Karole Armitage's (Tony Award nomination for Hair) ballet, Fables for Global Warming.[14]
In 2016, Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures, the first definitive, feature length portrait of the controversial American artist Robert Mapplethorpe, produced by Otto-Bernstein, premiered at Sundance Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival to rave reviews.[15] The film had its TV premiere on HBO on April 4, 2016 and is currently being released theatrically all over the world. Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures was nominated for two Emmy Awards: Outstanding Documentary Or Nonfiction Special and Outstanding Cinematography For A Nonfiction Program.
Other Interests[edit]
Otto-Bernstein is currently serving her 15th year on the Dean's Council of Columbia University School of the Arts as well as spearheading the Film Department’s thesis mentor program. She was honored by her Alma Mater with the prestigious Columbia University Alumni Medal in 2009.[16] In 2012, Otto-Bernstein donated a state-of-the-art screening room at Columbia University's Lenfest Center for the Arts, designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano.[17]
Otto-Bernstein is a trustee and advisory director of the Metropolitan Opera, a member of the International Director’s Council of the Guggenheim Museum, and has served in the past as a trustee of the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Animal Legal Defense Fund. She actively supports a variety of social and cultural causes that foster sustainable and humane practices, and promote freedom of expression and peaceful co-existence throughout the world.

Life and Education[edit]
Otto-Bernstein (née Otto) was born in Hamburg, Germany, the youngest daughter of German industrialist Werner Otto[2] (Crate & Barrel) and his third wife Maren. She has four siblings: Michael Otto, Ingvild Goetz, Alexander Otto and Frank Otto.
After attending St. Clare’s Hall in Oxford, England, Otto-Bernstein moved to New York to study philosophy and political science at Columbia College (BA) and received her MGA in screenwriting and directing from Columbia University Film School.
Otto-Bernstein is married to New York art dealer Nathan A. Bernstein. They have two children: Nicholas and Jonathan.
Career[edit]
As an undergraduate Otto-Bernstein worked for Town & Country magazine and wrote a lifestyle column for German Vogue. In 1989, she was hired by British director Don Boyd (Aria, Twenty-One, My Kingdom) to work on the East-West thriller entitled The Berlin Project. Once the production crew arrived in the divided capital, Otto-Bernstein became a witness to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the unification of East and West Germany. This gave Otto-Bernstein the incentive to direct the television documentary, Coming Home (1990), dealing with the re-unification of German families, and compile the interview collection, In the Shadow of the Wall, featuring interviews with East German personalities, including intelligence agents Günter Guillaume, Horst Hesse, and the Soviet spy Ruth Kuczynski (Red Sonja).
Upon her return to the US, Otto-Bernstein directed the comedy, The Second Greatest Story Ever Told (1992), starring Mira Sorvino and Malcolm McDowell; the television documentary, The Need for Speed (1993); and the American segments of the documentaries When Night Falls Over Moscow - Arms Dealing in the Former Soviet Union and The Industrialists Hall of Fame (1993). In 1994, she founded the production company Film Manufacturers Inc. (FMI).
Otto-Bernstein's Beautopia premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 1998.[3] The film probes the dark side of modeling and features fashion icons such as Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Valentino Garavani, Karl Lagerfeld, and Calvin Klein. Beautopia was the Grand Prize Nominee at Sundance and won the Silver Hugo at the Chicago International Film Festival.[4] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the film “a terrific and lively feminist analysis.”[5]
In 1998, Otto-Bernstein met American theatre and opera director Robert Wilson (Einstein on the Beach, Black Rider, Lohengrin) at a cocktail party.[6] This marked the beginning of a seven-year collaboration on the internationally acclaimed biopic, Absolute Wilson. The film features prominent collaborators such as Philip Glass, David Byrne, Tom Waits, Jessye Norman, and literary icon Susan Sontag in one of her last interviews. Absolute Wilson premiered to great critical acclaim at the 2006 Berlin International Film Festival[7] and became an international festival sensation, earning the prestigious Art Film of the Year award from Art Basel. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote in his review: “An artist who operates on such a groundbreaking, international level as Robert Wilson deserves a documentary as good as Absolute Wilson.”[8] A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted: “ Absolute Wilson makes you wish you had been there. Ms. Otto-Bernstein has performed heroic work."[9]
In 2006, Otto-Bernstein published Absolute Wilson: The Biography (Prestel, Random House). She also penned the chapter “Absolute Watermill” for The Watermill Center – Robert Wilson’s Legacy (2011, Daco-Verlag, Stuttgart), and her short story "Dog Days" appeared in the book No Better Friend: Celebrities and the Dogs They Love, a collection of intimate essays edited by Elke Gazzara.[10]
In October 2012, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Otto-Bernstein's Film Manufacturers Inc. is co-producing the German language thriller, Galapagos, together with KJ Entertainment.[11] The film, written by Kathrin Lohmann and Katharina Otto-Bernstein, is based on Margret Wittmer's autobiography, Floreana: A Woman’s Pilgrimage to the Galapagos, and will be helmed by Marc Rothemund (Academy Award nomination for Sophie Scholl: The Final Days).[12][13]
In 2013, Otto-Bernstein served as dramaturge on choreographer Karole Armitage's (Tony Award nomination for Hair) ballet, Fables for Global Warming.[14]
In 2016, Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures, the first definitive, feature length portrait of the controversial American artist Robert Mapplethorpe, produced by Otto-Bernstein, premiered at Sundance Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival to rave reviews.[15] The film had its TV premiere on HBO on April 4, 2016 and is currently being released theatrically all over the world. Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures was nominated for two Emmy Awards: Outstanding Documentary Or Nonfiction Special and Outstanding Cinematography For A Nonfiction Program.
Other Interests[edit]
Otto-Bernstein is currently serving her 15th year on the Dean's Council of Columbia University School of the Arts as well as spearheading the Film Department’s thesis mentor program. She was honored by her Alma Mater with the prestigious Columbia University Alumni Medal in 2009.[16] In 2012, Otto-Bernstein donated a state-of-the-art screening room at Columbia University's Lenfest Center for the Arts, designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano.[17]
Otto-Bernstein is a trustee and advisory director of the Metropolitan Opera, a member of the International Director’s Council of the Guggenheim Museum, and has served in the past as a trustee of the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Animal Legal Defense Fund. She actively supports a variety of social and cultural causes that foster sustainable and humane practices, and promote freedom of expression and peaceful co-existence throughout the world.

Life and Education[edit]
Otto-Bernstein (née Otto) was born in Hamburg, Germany, the youngest daughter of German industrialist Werner Otto[2] (Crate & Barrel) and his third wife Maren. She has four siblings: Michael Otto, Ingvild Goetz, Alexander Otto and Frank Otto.
After attending St. Clare’s Hall in Oxford, England, Otto-Bernstein moved to New York to study philosophy and political science at Columbia College (BA) and received her MGA in screenwriting and directing from Columbia University Film School.
Otto-Bernstein is married to New York art dealer Nathan A. Bernstein. They have two children: Nicholas and Jonathan.
Career[edit]
As an undergraduate Otto-Bernstein worked for Town & Country magazine and wrote a lifestyle column for German Vogue. In 1989, she was hired by British director Don Boyd (Aria, Twenty-One, My Kingdom) to work on the East-West thriller entitled The Berlin Project. Once the production crew arrived in the divided capital, Otto-Bernstein became a witness to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the unification of East and West Germany. This gave Otto-Bernstein the incentive to direct the television documentary, Coming Home (1990), dealing with the re-unification of German families, and compile the interview collection, In the Shadow of the Wall, featuring interviews with East German personalities, including intelligence agents Günter Guillaume, Horst Hesse, and the Soviet spy Ruth Kuczynski (Red Sonja).
Upon her return to the US, Otto-Bernstein directed the comedy, The Second Greatest Story Ever Told (1992), starring Mira Sorvino and Malcolm McDowell; the television documentary, The Need for Speed (1993); and the American segments of the documentaries When Night Falls Over Moscow - Arms Dealing in the Former Soviet Union and The Industrialists Hall of Fame (1993). In 1994, she founded the production company Film Manufacturers Inc. (FMI).
Otto-Bernstein's Beautopia premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 1998.[3] The film probes the dark side of modeling and features fashion icons such as Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Valentino Garavani, Karl Lagerfeld, and Calvin Klein. Beautopia was the Grand Prize Nominee at Sundance and won the Silver Hugo at the Chicago International Film Festival.[4] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the film “a terrific and lively feminist analysis.”[5]
In 1998, Otto-Bernstein met American theatre and opera director Robert Wilson (Einstein on the Beach, Black Rider, Lohengrin) at a cocktail party.[6] This marked the beginning of a seven-year collaboration on the internationally acclaimed biopic, Absolute Wilson. The film features prominent collaborators such as Philip Glass, David Byrne, Tom Waits, Jessye Norman, and literary icon Susan Sontag in one of her last interviews. Absolute Wilson premiered to great critical acclaim at the 2006 Berlin International Film Festival[7] and became an international festival sensation, earning the prestigious Art Film of the Year award from Art Basel. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote in his review: “An artist who operates on such a groundbreaking, international level as Robert Wilson deserves a documentary as good as Absolute Wilson.”[8] A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted: “ Absolute Wilson makes you wish you had been there. Ms. Otto-Bernstein has performed heroic work."[9]
In 2006, Otto-Bernstein published Absolute Wilson: The Biography (Prestel, Random House). She also penned the chapter “Absolute Watermill” for The Watermill Center – Robert Wilson’s Legacy (2011, Daco-Verlag, Stuttgart), and her short story "Dog Days" appeared in the book No Better Friend: Celebrities and the Dogs They Love, a collection of intimate essays edited by Elke Gazzara.[10]
In October 2012, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Otto-Bernstein's Film Manufacturers Inc. is co-producing the German language thriller, Galapagos, together with KJ Entertainment.[11] The film, written by Kathrin Lohmann and Katharina Otto-Bernstein, is based on Margret Wittmer's autobiography, Floreana: A Woman’s Pilgrimage to the Galapagos, and will be helmed by Marc Rothemund (Academy Award nomination for Sophie Scholl: The Final Days).[12][13]
In 2013, Otto-Bernstein served as dramaturge on choreographer Karole Armitage's (Tony Award nomination for Hair) ballet, Fables for Global Warming.[14]
In 2016, Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures, the first definitive, feature length portrait of the controversial American artist Robert Mapplethorpe, produced by Otto-Bernstein, premiered at Sundance Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival to rave reviews.[15] The film had its TV premiere on HBO on April 4, 2016 and is currently being released theatrically all over the world. Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures was nominated for two Emmy Awards: Outstanding Documentary Or Nonfiction Special and Outstanding Cinematography For A Nonfiction Program.
Other Interests[edit]
Otto-Bernstein is currently serving her 15th year on the Dean's Council of Columbia University School of the Arts as well as spearheading the Film Department’s thesis mentor program. She was honored by her Alma Mater with the prestigious Columbia University Alumni Medal in 2009.[16] In 2012, Otto-Bernstein donated a state-of-the-art screening room at Columbia University's Lenfest Center for the Arts, designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano.[17]
Otto-Bernstein is a trustee and advisory director of the Metropolitan Opera, a member of the International Director’s Council of the Guggenheim Museum, and has served in the past as a trustee of the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Animal Legal Defense Fund. She actively supports a variety of social and cultural causes that foster sustainable and humane practices, and promote freedom of expression and peaceful co-existence throughout the world.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
