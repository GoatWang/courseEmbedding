Nucor Executive Vice President Mike Parrish to Retire; James R. Darsey to Be PromotedCHARLOTTE, N.C., July 1, 2010 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) Executive Vice President of Bar Products D. Michael Parrish announced today his plans to retire at the end of August after 35 years of service with Nucor.  Mr. Parrish began his career as an engineer in Saint Joe, Indiana at Vulcraft in 1975; served as Engineering Manager of Vulcraft, Brigham City, Utah from 1981 to 1986; Production Manager of Vulcraft, Fort Payne, Alabama from 1986 to 1989; General Manager of Vulcraft, Brigham City, Utah from 1989 to 1991; General Manager of Nucor Steel, Jewett, Texas from 1991 to 1995; and General Manager of Nucor Steel, Hickman, Arkansas from 1995 to 1998.  He was promoted to Vice President in 1990 and to Executive Vice President in 1998.

Effective September 1, 2010, James R. Darsey will be promoted to Executive Vice President of Bar Products.  Mr. Darsey began his Nucor career in 1979 as a Design Engineer at Vulcraft in Grapeland, Texas.  He then served as Engineering Manager of Vulcraft, Brigham City, Utah from 1986 to 1987; Engineering Manager of Vulcraft, Grapeland, Texas from 1987 to 1995; General Manager of Vulcraft, Grapeland, Texas from 1995 to 1999; and General Manager of Nucor Steel, Jewett, Texas from 1999 to 2007.  He was promoted to Vice President in 1996 and to President of Vulcraft/Verco Group in 2007.

Dan DiMicco, Nucor's Chairman, President and CEO, commented: "Mike Parrish has been an exceptional leader throughout his 35-year career with Nucor.  He has made outstanding contributions to both Nucor's strong record of profitable growth and our company's unique culture.  Under Mike's leadership, our Bar Mill Group more than doubled in size to a current finished steel shipment capacity exceeding 9 million tons annually.  With his team's very successful work in optimizing existing operations and completing strategic acquisitions, the growth in the earnings power of our bar products business has been even greater.  Mike's retirement and Jim Darsey's promotion result from the thoughtful and orderly succession planning that has been a top strategic initiative throughout the Nucor organization in recent years as we position our company for continued profitable growth.  Jim Darsey is a proven Nucor leader.  He has a strong record of success in managing both the steel mill and downstream products sides of our business.  Jim and his team are well-prepared to continue building long-term profitable growth at Nucor's bar products business.

"All of us at Nucor are thankful for Mike's great leadership and everyone joins me in wishing Mike and his wife Chris all the best as they enjoy the well-deserved fruits of their career at Nucor.....God Bless."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
