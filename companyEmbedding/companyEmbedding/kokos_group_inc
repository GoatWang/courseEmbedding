Coconuts grow on trees in tropical and subtropical locations and are part of the daily diet of many people there. They are not actual nuts; rather, they are drupes: a fruit in which an outer fleshy part surrounds a shell of hardened endocarp with a seed inside (according to Wikipedia). When immature, they contain a lot of water and may be harvested for drinking. Coconuts have been sold in North American grocery stores for years, yet haven’t gained prominence in our diets. But in recent years, their water has become incredibly popular, suddenly recognized here for the variety of nutritional benefits that many societies have known about for eons​.      Coconut water is an excellent low calorie thirst quencher to beat tropical summer thirst. Because of its electrolyte composition, coconut water is also used to rehydrate the body in case of dehydration and fluid loss due to diarrhea, vomiting or excessive sweating. A good source of carbohydrates, it also helps lift your energy level. Research suggests coconut water can be used to rehydrate the body after exercise. The International Society of Sports Nutrition found that coconut water has similar positive effects as sports drinks. In addition to boosting rehydration, coconut water is also easy on the stomach and thus is used to soothe stomach troubles like indigestion, acid reflux and gastroenteritis.        Coconut water contains a unique combination of B vitamins, vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, micro-nutrients, and phyto-hormones (plant hormones) that are exceptionally beneficial to your health. A scientific review of coconut water, published in the journal Molecules highlights some of the ways that coconut water replenishes your body: helps to prevent heart attacks, lower high blood pressure, can have anti-aging effects, fights free radicals to help prevent cancer, contains trans-zeatin (plant hormone which regulates cell division and development) which can be used to treat Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.

The funds raised in this offering will not be placed into an escrow account or
trust account and will be immediately accessible to the Company. If necessary,
Jeoffrey Baterina, our sole officer and director, has verbally agreed to loan
the company funds to complete the registration process in the event that the
Company depletes its current cash reserves prior to effectiveness of this
registration statement, but we will require full funding to begin to implement
our complete business plan.


Packaged coconut water is really flooding into the market. You can find it in
bottles, cartons or powdered, frozen, flavored, carbonated and sweetened. With
all these choices it can be confusing and difficult to know if you are choosing
the best one. The Company’s product competes broadly with all beverages
available to consumers. The coconut water industry is highly competitive with
estimated sales in the United States of 1 billion dollars and growing. We
estimate that there are approximately 50 bottled coconut water brands in the
United States with sales concentrated among the larger companies, especially
those controlled by PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. Nearly all of our competitors are
more experienced, have vastly greater financial and management resources and
have more established proprietary trademarks and distribution networks than we
do. On a national basis, we would compete with large beverage companies, such as
PepsiCo (which produces O.N.E Coconut Water), Coca-Cola (which produces Zico
coconut water). Other brands include Vito CoCo (partially owned by Red Bull)
Harmless Harvest, Invo Coconut Water, Taste Nirvana Coconut water and CocoZona
to name a few competitions for market share in the coconut water industry. These
and other competitors are likely to have distribution channels for their
products that we do not have, which places us at a significant disadvantage.
While the Company believes that it can compete favorably on differentiation
providing our proposed organic non-additive coconut water, we are yet to see if
we can compete in quality, merchandising and are weak with regards to, brand
name recognition and loyalty, there can be no assurance that the Company and its
product lines will not experience increasing competitive pressures from both
traditional and new age beverage companies, many of whom have substantially
greater marketing, cash, distribution, technical and other resources than the
Company.


Company Description
We are an early stage company with the intention to engage in the business of
the production, distribution and marketing of bottled organic coconut water from
bulk coconut water sourced from the Philippine and bottled in the United States.
We currently have no product, but plan on developing our


 first bottled coconut
water product under the brand name “Koos Coconut Water”.

Coconut water contains a unique combination of B vitamins, vitamin C.,
micronutrients, and phyto-hormones that are exceptionally beneficial to your
health. A scientific review of pure organic coconut water with no additives
shows that it can help to prevent heart attacks; lower high blood pressure, has
anti-aging effects, and fights free radicals to help prevent cancer. Our primary
business objective is to produce, distribute and market and sell our core
planned product organic coconut water under the brand name Koos Coconut Water,
which is pure organic coconut water, with no additives.

There is no need for the Company to purchase or otherwise obtain special
equipment to manufacture, bottle, and label or pack its Kokos Group Inc.
proposed coconut water product. The Company plans to manufacture, bottle, label
and pack its proposed Koos Coconut Water product under its as yet to be
negotiate with a co-packing companies, which has all such equipment. The Kokos
Group Inc. plans to sell its proposed coconut water product in the following
bottle sizes: 8oz and 16oz.

During the next 12 months, Kokos Group Inc. intends on developing the Kokos
Group Inc. proposed product and, once such product is developed and exists, we
will begin attempting to distribute, market and sell the Kokos Group Inc.
proposed product under the brand name of Koos Coconut Water throughout Oregon,
Washington State and neighboring States to large box store retailers,
convenience stores, specialty health food stores, grocery chains, hotels and
some non-traditional corporate business within this market. We have identified a
bulk coconut organic water supplier from the Philippines that has a storage
facility in Eugene, Oregon. Therefore the pacific northwest of the United States
is the ideal location to market the initial business and proposed product.
---

There is the likelihood that we may never be able to import the bulk coconut
water we require, and design, bottle, market, brand, sell, and produce our
proposed product or, operate or own or have access to a negative ion processing
and water bottling plant that produces commercially viable quantities of water.
We are presently in the early development stage of our business and we can
provide no assurance that we will be able to import bulk coconut water and then
design, bottle, market, brand, sell, and produce our proposed coconut water or,
have access to a co-packer(s) who will bottle and process our proposed product.
Further development and market research is required before a final determination
can be made as to whether our proposed organic coconut water with the product
name Koos Coconut Water would be commercially viable. If our company is not
capable of building a market for our proposed product or import commercially
viable quantities of organic coconut water, all funds that we spend on
development will be lost.

Janitorial Supplies
Whether it is chemicals or brooms, you are likely to find it in our Janitorial selection



        Janitorial supplies are a natural fit for FoodserviceDirect. Since we've been at this for a while, we've been fortunate to develop good relationships with the major manufacturers like Procter & Gamble, Colgate Palmolive and Rubbermaid. Equally important, though, are those hard to find oddball products like extension poles to reach high places by Unger. In all, we offer an extensive line of janitorial supply items including soaps,cleaning tools, detergents and cleaning equipment. Many foodservice operators enjoy the benefits of combining janitorial supplies with their food and equipment orders.
