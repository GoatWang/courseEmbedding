Targets Libor +250 basis pointsLong Duration Total ReturnSeeks long-term total return through active asset allocation using the traditional Liability Driven Investing (LDI) asset classes, U.S. Government and U.S. Corporate securities, but differentiates itself by adding long-term agency mortgages to that mix. The advantage to adding mortgages is to potentially add alpha with lower volatility and higher credit quality in comparison to corporate bonds, but also cut down on overall credit exposure.Benchmark: Barclays Long U.S. Government/Corporate IndexLow DurationSeeks current income with reduced volatility. Incorporates active asset allocation across fixed income sectors using short duration securities including a mix of both fixed and floating rate products while maintaining a balance between credit and interest rate risk.Benchmark: BofA/Merrill Lynch 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury IndexOpportunistic Core Plus Fixed IncomeSeeks maximum current income and total return through a more aggressive active asset allocation approach across fixed income sectors while trying to mitigate risk and achieve better risk-adjusted returns. The strategy maintains a higher targeted alpha and tracking error.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexTotal Return TacticalSeeks to maximize total return across fixed income sectors while maintaining active risk management constraints.

The strategy has two primary drivers of alpha: 1) Actively managing risk exposures by changing the mix between government and credit which have potentially off-setting risks. Historically the strategy has used mortgages for both government and credit components because mortgages offer homogeneous fundamentals. 2) Duration is actively managed and maintained lower than the benchmark.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexEquitiesDescriptionBenchmarkShiller Enhanced CAPEÂ®Seeks total return which exceeds the benchmark index. The strategy maintains a core portfolio of debt instruments that focuses on global fixed income sector rotation while simultaneously obtaining exposure to the Shiller CAPEÂ® US Sector TR USD Index. The rules-based index aims to identify undervalued sectors based on a modified CAPEÂ® Ratio which then uses a momentum factor to mitigate the effects of potential value traps. By using both a value indicator and a momentum indicator, the Index aims to provide more stable and improved risk adjusted returns.Benchmark: S&P 500CommoditiesDescriptionBenchmarkStrategic CommodityStrategic Commodity2 will maintain a core long-commodity biased weighting while tactically allocating to the long-short dollar-neutral commodity strategy when a long-only strategy may not be as attractive. The long commodity positions are focused on commodities that have historically exhibited the highest degree of backwardation while the long-short strategy utilizes fundamental signals to determine its allocation. The long bias will make up 50-100% of the strategy allocation while the opportunistic long/short will comprise 0-50%.Benchmark: Bloomberg Commodity IndexGlobal MacroDescriptionBenchmarkMulti-Asset GrowthSeeks long-term capital appreciation with an absolute return focus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investorâs shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fundâs future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fundâs annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date â With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fundâs assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date â Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend â A portion of a companyâs profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains â Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fundâs portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains â Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fundâs portfolio for less than one year

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investorâs shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fundâs future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fundâs annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date â With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fundâs assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date â Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend â A portion of a companyâs profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains â Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fundâs portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains â Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fundâs portfolio for less than one year
