March 27 2014
U.S. Bancorp Vice Chairman Kent Stone Appointed to the  Operation HOPE Global Board of Directors




LOS ANGELES – March 27, 2014 – Financial dignity nonprofit Operation HOPE (HOPE) announced today the appointment of Kent V. Stone, vice chairman of consumer banking sales and support at U.S. Bancorp to the HOPE Global Board of Directors. Mr. Stone’s appointment will strengthen Project 5117, the organization’s initiative to fulfill Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s mission to bring economic equality to unserved communities.

A dedicated partner of HOPE, U.S. Bancorp has supported youth financial literacy through Banking on Our Future, adult empowerment through the Financial Dignity Center networks and bolstered initiatives being advanced by the Financial Services Roundtable Framework Agreement.

Since 1980, Mr. Stone has held various senior management positions within U.S. Bancorp. Today, Mr. Stone leads U.S. Bank’s overall consumer and small business strategy and product management functions, as well as 24-hour banking, internet and mobile channel, mortgage and all consumer lending activities.

Mr. Stone, who lives in Sacramento, is involved in a number of community groups including the Greater Sacramento Urban League, which he serves as a board member and treasurer, and the American Diabetes Association Father of the Year Council. Originally from Minnesota where U.S. Bancorp is based, he also serves as a board member of the Minnesota Twins Community Fund. 

Richard “Rick” Hartnack, former vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp, has supported HOPE for 20 years and has since become a member of the HOPE Board Emeritus.

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), with $364 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2013, is the parent company of U.S. Bank, the 5th largest commercial bank in the United States. The company operates 3,081 banking offices in 25 states and 4,906 ATMs and provides a comprehensive line of banking, brokerage, insurance, investment, mortgage, trust and payment services products to consumers, businesses and institutions. Visit U.S. Bancorp on the web at www.usbank.com.

Operation HOPE has been America’s leading financial literacy and empowerment social investment organization since 1992. HOPE Boards help shape organizational policy and provides overall support and direction for the organization's activities. It is comprised of some of the most powerful executives, decision-makers, bankers and economists in the world. These individuals play an essential role in driving Project 5117, HOPE’s Silver Rights Movement and next phase to expand economic opportunity, and making capitalism and free enterprise accessible in underserved communities.

A complete 2014 list of HOPE's board members may be viewed here.
