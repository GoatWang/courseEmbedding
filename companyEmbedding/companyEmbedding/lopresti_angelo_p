 Educational Background



B.A. in Economics 


Trinity College

                  Trinity College looks like a traditional New England liberal arts school.

But we act in some untraditional ways.

Our commitment to urban-global education, for example, is groundbreaking, as is our interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program and our First-Year Program, one of the earliest in the nation. We have also just added more than 20 young teacher/scholars to our faculty, and our faculty across the board is committed to collaboration with students on real-world research projects.

We continue to re-examine and transform the concept of liberal arts education because our graduates expect to thrive and to have a serious effect on the world.

Trinity’s 10:1 student/faculty ratio means access to teachers who have time to discuss your term paper in person, encourage your research project, and celebrate your success on Commencement Day. Choose from 38 academic majors in the liberal arts and sciences, including one in engineering, another program that is not traditional for a college like Trinity. Twenty-six interdisciplinary minors like human rights, Jewish studies, and African American studies give you even more choices.

World-wide study abroad, courses that include interaction with the city around us, and for-credit academic internships give you experience beyond the classroom.

And yes, our campus is beautiful in a traditional New England-college way—100 green acres dotted with historic buildings—and it’s located in an interesting place, Connecticut’s state capital, the city of Hartford. It’s home to 2,300 students from 45 states and 47 countries who connect to the College and each other through 100 student organizations, 29 NCAA Division III athletic teams, internships, and volunteer projects.

You can learn about all of this here on our Web site—academics, athletics, student activities, and more—but the best thing is to visit Trinity and see for yourself. Campus visits are conducted year-round, and you are always welcome
