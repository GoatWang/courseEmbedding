Why Shares of Mueller Water Products, Inc. Plunged 13% Today
Weak international sales spooked investors and sent Mueller Water Products' shares lower to end the week. 











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            Apr 28, 2017 at 3:58PM
            
            





What happened 
Shares of Mueller Water Products, Inc. (NYSE:MWA) fell as much as 12.5% in trading on Friday after the company reported fiscal second-quarter results. At 2:55 p.m. EDT, shares were still down 10.8% on the day. 
So what
Net sales were up 1.3% to $119.7 million and adjusted income from continuing operations were up 42.6% to $15.4 million, or $0.09 per share. Mueller Technologies drove the growth with a 20.7% increase in sales to $18.1 million, offset by a small decline in Mueller Co. sales to $181.6 million. 

Image source: Getty Images.

Earnings per share hit analyst estimates on the market, but there was an expectation that Mueller would report $206.6 million in sales for the quarter. The miss on the top line is likely what traders are focused on today. 





Now what
Management said that bad weather in the western U.S. and weak international sales were the drivers of the worse-than-expected quarter. The weather was a temporary setback, but lagging international sales may be a long-term concern for investors. With weak growth and an uncertain international segment, I don't think shares look very attractive at 23 times this year's earnings estimates. For that reason, this isn't a discount I will be jumping on today.

						Pool Cleaners: The greatest labor-saving item you can purchase for keeping your pool sparkling and beautiful, PoolSupplyWorld has the best automatic and handheld cleaners on the market. Shop a wide variety of suction-side, pressure-side, fully robotic, or broom-style pool cleaners, or pick up powerful booster pumps and cleaning accessories today.


Suction Side Cleaners:
Suction side cleaners use the suction from the pool pump to move  the cleaner around the pool. Because of this, they move randomly, collecting  dirt and debris and sending it directly to the pump strainer basket and filter.  Frequent backwashing and cleaning of the pool filter is needed with these  cleaners. Suction side cleaners are the most popular automatic pool cleaner on  the market and are best suited for pools with gradual curves and few obstacles. 
Advantages:

Economical
Easy to install and operate
Low maintenance

Pressure Side Cleaners:
Pressure side cleaners,  also called return side cleaners, are  powered by water pressure that is generated by the pool pump or a booster pump.  All dirt and debris are caught in the attached mesh bag, instead of sending it  back to the pool’s filter. The mesh bag also filters the water even further before it  circulates back into the pool. The pressure side cleaner operates when the pool  pump is running. 
Advantages:

Attached mesh bag catches dirt and  debris, keeping it out of the filter
The better the water pressure, the  more efficient the cleaner 
Helps distributes  clean and filtered water around pool

Pressure Side Cleaners Requiring Booster Pump: 
Pressure side cleaners  with a booster pump operate the same as a regular pressure side cleaner but  from an external, dedicated ¾ horsepower booster pump instead of the main pool  circulation pump. The addition of the booster pump allows the pressure side cleaner  to clean faster and vacuum with increased power and efficiency. The pressure  side cleaner also comes with the attached mesh bag for collecting dirt and  debris.
Advantages:

Booster pump increases power and  efficiency 
Longer life because it  operates from a dedicated external pump
Dirt and debris deposited into attached fine mesh bag

Robotic Cleaners:
Robotic pool cleaners  operate independently of the pool’s filtration system, running on standard  240-volt power. Robotic pool cleaners have computers and sensors that clean  while avoiding obstacles and without covering the same area twice. Pool owners  love the scrubbing action of the brushes that clean the walls, floor, and tile  lining. These cleaners do an excellent job of collecting small debris  particles, such as dirt and silt, and collect the debris in a self-contained  filter. 
Advantages:

Powered by electricity, not your filtration system
Brushes scrub walls, floor, and tile lining 
Best cleaner of small debris particles
Self-contained filter extends the life of your pool       filtration system

					Your pool pump's job is to circulate water. This not only keeps the water moving, but also pushes the water through your filtration system to  eliminate particle debris and other contaminants. To do its job correctly, it's important to make sure your pump is the right size for your pool. If you get a pump that's too small, it will struggle to circulate your water, leading to inefficient use of energy, as well as risking algae growth. A pump that's too big for your needs may produce pressure greater than your plumbing or filter can handle, which can lead to equipment damage.

Another feature to keep in mind is the pool pump’s motor speed: single, dual or variable speed. Single speed pool pumps are typically used on smaller pools, spas and water features. Dual speed and variable speed pool pumps are rising in popularity with state regulations requiring pool owners to purchase ‘multi-speed’ pool pumps when they upgrade from a single speed pump. The good news is that many local utility companies are offering generous rebates for variable speed pump purchases. Check HERE for more information. 

PoolSupplyWorld carries the most popular and trusted brands when it comes to swimming pool pumps--Pentair, Jandy, Hayward and, many more. We have a wide selection of high quality, durable swimming pool pumps available in stock. If you need help selecting the perfect pool pump don’t hesitate to contact us at (800) 772-0467.
