nell’operazione con Hutton Collins Italy17-01-2014Eversheds Bianchini, con un team guidato da Marco Franzini e di cui ha fatto parte anche Nicola Zito, ha assistito come advisor legale Health Holding Company S.r.l. e Mandarin Capital Partners SCA SICAR, rispettivamente società holding di controllo e socio finanziario del Gruppo Dedalus, nella strutturazione ed esecuzione dell’operazione di riorganizzazione dell’azionariato del Gruppo Dedalus, di reinvestimento di Health Holding Company S.r.l e di Mandarin Capital Partners SCA SICAR nel Gruppo Dedalus e di ingresso nel medesimo gruppo da parte di Hutton Collins, assistito da Gianni, Origoni, Grippo, Cappelli & Partners. Clifford Chance ha seguito la disamina di aspetti fiscali in Italia e, per conto di Hutton Collins, di aspetti legali e fiscali in Lussemburgo.L’operazione ha portato all’acquisizione dei soci di minoranza in uscita e al reperimento di risorse finanziare per circa 25 milioni di euro per lo sviluppo della internazionalizzazione ed il consolidamento del Gruppo Dedalus ora interamente posseduto da Dedalus Holding S.p.A. con i soci Health Holding Company S.r.l. (oltre 50%), Mandarin Capital Partners SCA SICAR (quasi 36%) e HC Leo SA holding lussembrughese di Hutton Collins (14%).Il Gruppo Dedalus – con sede a Firenze, circa 70 milioni di euro di fatturato e  17 milioni di Ebitda – è oggi la più grande azienda nazionale nel settore dei sistemi informativi sanitari, con attività in 12 paesi nel mondo. Dedalus si è consolidata negli ultimi anni, perseguendo il progetto di creare il polo italiano dell’ICT sanitario, aggregando oltre 30 aziende in Italia e nel mondo e grazie al supporto di Mandarin Capital Partners, socio dell’azienda dal 2010, è riuscita a penetrare con successo nel mercato cinese dove oggi è presente con circa 150 professionisti.“È stata un’articolata e significativa operazione per i nostri clienti ed anche per il mercato del private equity, non solo di mid-market, in Italia - ha dichiarato Marco Franzini, responsabile della private equity e banking practice di Eversheds Bianchini – e siamo onorati di aver assistito un gruppo come Dedalus ed i suoi soci di controllo nel reperimento del capitale di rischio e di debito per il prossimo sviluppo anche internazionale del gruppo.”

deal with Hutton Collins ItalyGeneral20-01-2014Eversheds Bianchini, the Italian office of law firm Eversheds, with a team headed by Marco Franzini and also with the associate Nicola Zito, has acted as legal advisor of Health Holding Company S.r.l., Mandarin Capital Partners SCA SICAR and Dedalus Group for the reorganization of the shareholding structure of the Dedalus Group, the reinvestment of Health Holding Company Srl and Mandarin Capital Partners SCA SICAR and the investment of Hutton Collins.The operation led to the buy-out of the exiting minority shareholders and the raising of about EUR 25 million fresh money to the finance expansion, internationalization and consolidation plans of Dedalus Group, now wholly owned by Dedalus Holding S.p.A., with shareholders Health Holding Company S.r.l. (over 50%), Mandarin Capital Partners SCA SICAR (almost 36%) and HC Leo SA the Luxco of Hutton Collins (14%).The Dedalus Group - established in Florence, roughly EUR 70 million revenues and EUR 17 million EBITDA - is today the largest Italian company in the healthcare information systems business, operating worldwide in 12 countries. Dedalus consolidated more than 30 companies in Italy and internationally in the recent years, as part of its plans to become the new Italian healthcare ICT reference for excellence. Thanks to the support of Mandarin Capital Partners SCA SICAR, shareholder of the company since 2010, Dedalus has been able to successfully penetrate the Chinese market where it is today established with over 150 people. “It was a structured and important transaction for our clients and also for the private equity market, not only mid-market in Italy - said Marco Franzini, head of the Italian private equity and banking practice - and we are honoured to have assisted a group like Dedalus and its controlling shareholders for the raising of equity and debt capital for the expansion and internationalization of the group.”
