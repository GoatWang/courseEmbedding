TRxADE ExchangeYou are here: Home / Our Products / TRxADE Exchange





TRxADE Exchange
The TRxADE pharmaceutical exchange opens and widens the distribution channel to the retail, community pharmacy like never before.  A purchasing pharmacy is able to view products from manufacturers, buying groups and wholesalers on a real-time and continuous basis. This approach significantly enhances the competitive spirit of the exchange where the lowest price exists for each product at any given point in time.
Due to the restrictive nature of the pharmaceutical distribution channel and consequent lack of descriptive price transparency and product availability, TRxADE has become a competitive tool for all progressive entities.  Our listed products have earned the reputation of being the most competitively priced in the nation with high availability rates from our quality national supplier partners.
TRxADE is recognized for its easy searching of hard-to-find generic pharmaceuticals at substantially reduced prices.  TRxADE applies a proactive, sophisticated approach to inventory product management that is utilized in other industries, but not in the monopolized and restrictive, pharmaceutical channel of distribution.  Providing valid and immediate price transparency is TRxADE’s motto.
At TRxADE, we have developed a corporate strategy of penetrating the existing independent, retail community pharmacy marketplace and to concentrically diversify and expand our product mix with additional specialty and acute care pharmaceutical products.  Our exchange can also expand, without modification, to the clinical, hospital and governmental markets.

Don’t Take Our Word For It…What Others Say About TRxADE



“Once we got the hang of it, using TRxADE has been very easy. Before we order from our primary or secondary supplier, we always check their prices against what’s available on TRxADE. When the price on TRxADE is lower by at least 10%, we purchase there and stock up on that item. TRxADE has saved us a lot of money.”
Larry K. R.Ph.Pharmacist/Owner, Maple Shade, NJ
“The data available from using their analytical tools really allows me to see around corners and prepare myself in a tough marketplace. When a competing representative calls our staff we just let them know that we purchase through TRxADE. We know we’re getting the lowest cost on all of our purchases. Our commitment to TRxADE has saved us time and money.”
Jud S. R.Ph.Pharmacist/Owner, Nashville, TN
“I don’t have time to talk to ten different secondary wholesalers throughout the day! TRxADE makes it easy to shop prices at my convenience and creates a competitive atmosphere among secondary wholesalers which drives prices lower. I know I’m getting the best price the market has to offer!”
Joe A. R.Ph.Pharmacist/Owner, Wellsville, OH
“I can expand my business through many of the analytic tools available to me at no cost or obligation. What a breath of fresh air; a partner that does not dominate my every pharmacy function. Their system has really assisted me in target marketing and increasing revenue by having a real-time system that communicates to me and knows my margins before I purchase.”
Joanne R.Lead Technician, Atlanta, GA
