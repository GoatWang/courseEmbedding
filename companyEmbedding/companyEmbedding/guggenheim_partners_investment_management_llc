    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Organization[edit]
Guggenheim Partners provides services across insurance services, investment banking, capital markets, strategic direction, investment management, merchant banking, and asset management. Guggenheim Investment Advisors oversees about $50 billion in assets.[4][5]
In June 2009, Guggenheim hired former Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz as Executive Chairman to "focus on transforming Guggenheim's existing broker-dealer, which is focused on sales and trading of fixed income securities, into a full-service investment banking enterprise".[6]
In September 2009, Guggenheim hired former Goldman Sachs partner Peter Comisar as Vice Chairman and Head of West Coast Investment Banking.[7] The West Coast Advisory team is also headed by Managing Directors from Bear Stearns, Moelis & Co and Credit Suisse. The West Coast team focuses on Consumer Retail and Digital E-Commerce advisory while the NY office houses the remaining industry verticals and product groups with the except of oil & gas, which is based out of Houston.
In October 2009, Guggenheim hired former J.P. Morgan head of Media Investment Banking Mark Van Lith as Senior Managing Director and Head of Investment Banking.[8]
In March 2012, Guggenheim hired former Apollo Global Management director and vice chairman Henry Silverman as vice chairman of asset management.[9]
In January 2013, Guggenheim named former Yahoo! interim CEO Ross Levinsohn as CEO of private equity unit Guggenheim Digital Media.[10]
In May & June 2013, the firm also hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s co-head of U.S. leveraged finance capital markets Tom Stein, former Barclays head of retail investment banking and vice chairman Andrew Taussig, as well as managing directors Spencer Hart, Matthew Pilla, Ken Harada and Ryan Mash.[11]
In September 2013, Guggenheim Securities was named a financial adviser to Verizon in connection with its $130 billion acquisition of Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless.[12]
Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, the investment arm of Guggenheim Partners, was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with failure to disclose a $50 million loan made in 2010 to a senior executive from a client. The firm paid $20 million in 2015 to settle the charges.[13] The government agency also found that Guggenheim's compliance program did not prevent violations of federal securities laws. According to the SEC, the firm's employees did not report dozens of trips on clients' private airplanes and had overbilled a client $6.5 million in fees, taking nearly two years to reimburse them.[13]
On December 17, 2015, it was reported that in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company would spin out its media properties into a new holding company owned by an investment group led by Guggenheim president Todd Boehly, consisting of Mediabistro, Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter, and Dick Clark Productions.[14][15]
Investments[edit]
In May 2009, Guggenheim Partners acquired a controlling interest in financial services firm Transparent Value LLC.[16] In July 2009, it acquired Claymore Group, a firm known for its Exchange-traded funds "Guggenheim ETFs".  and unit investment trusts "Guggenheim UITs". .[17] In December 2009, Guggenheim acquired a division of Wellmark and renamed it Guggenheim Life & Annuity.[18] In February 2010, Guggenheim Partners acquired Security Benefit Corp, parent company of Rydex Funds.[19] In October 2011, it acquired the life insurance company EquiTrust from FBL Financial Group.[20] In 2012, Guggenheim affiliates acquired the US annuities business of Canadian insurers Industrial Alliance and Sun Life Financial.[21][22]
In March 2012, Guggenheim Baseball Management acquired the Los Angeles Dodgers team for $2.15 billion in cash.[23] The consortium consisted of Guggenheim controlling partner Mark Walter, former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson and partners Peter Guber, Stan Kasten, Bobby Patton and Todd Boehly.[24] The acquisition includes the surrounding land and parking lot of Dodger Stadium.[25] Mark Walter said of the acquisition: "It's a lot of money, but if we do our jobs right...the long-term point of view is that people will see that the value was there."[26]
That September, Guggenheim bought a stake in the entertainment production company Dick Clark Productions,[27] which produces specials such as the American Music Awards and the Golden Globe Awards and other television programming.
In January 2013, the company bought out the remainder of the business-to-business media company Prometheus Global Media[28][29] and acquired CardCash in November of the same year.[30] In February 2014, Guggenheim Partners acquired the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA.[31]

Organization[edit]
Guggenheim Partners provides services across insurance services, investment banking, capital markets, strategic direction, investment management, merchant banking, and asset management. Guggenheim Investment Advisors oversees about $50 billion in assets.[4][5]
In June 2009, Guggenheim hired former Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz as Executive Chairman to "focus on transforming Guggenheim's existing broker-dealer, which is focused on sales and trading of fixed income securities, into a full-service investment banking enterprise".[6]
In September 2009, Guggenheim hired former Goldman Sachs partner Peter Comisar as Vice Chairman and Head of West Coast Investment Banking.[7] The West Coast Advisory team is also headed by Managing Directors from Bear Stearns, Moelis & Co and Credit Suisse. The West Coast team focuses on Consumer Retail and Digital E-Commerce advisory while the NY office houses the remaining industry verticals and product groups with the except of oil & gas, which is based out of Houston.
In October 2009, Guggenheim hired former J.P. Morgan head of Media Investment Banking Mark Van Lith as Senior Managing Director and Head of Investment Banking.[8]
In March 2012, Guggenheim hired former Apollo Global Management director and vice chairman Henry Silverman as vice chairman of asset management.[9]
In January 2013, Guggenheim named former Yahoo! interim CEO Ross Levinsohn as CEO of private equity unit Guggenheim Digital Media.[10]
In May & June 2013, the firm also hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s co-head of U.S. leveraged finance capital markets Tom Stein, former Barclays head of retail investment banking and vice chairman Andrew Taussig, as well as managing directors Spencer Hart, Matthew Pilla, Ken Harada and Ryan Mash.[11]
In September 2013, Guggenheim Securities was named a financial adviser to Verizon in connection with its $130 billion acquisition of Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless.[12]
Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, the investment arm of Guggenheim Partners, was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with failure to disclose a $50 million loan made in 2010 to a senior executive from a client. The firm paid $20 million in 2015 to settle the charges.[13] The government agency also found that Guggenheim's compliance program did not prevent violations of federal securities laws. According to the SEC, the firm's employees did not report dozens of trips on clients' private airplanes and had overbilled a client $6.5 million in fees, taking nearly two years to reimburse them.[13]
On December 17, 2015, it was reported that in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company would spin out its media properties into a new holding company owned by an investment group led by Guggenheim president Todd Boehly, consisting of Mediabistro, Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter, and Dick Clark Productions.[14][15]
Investments[edit]
In May 2009, Guggenheim Partners acquired a controlling interest in financial services firm Transparent Value LLC.[16] In July 2009, it acquired Claymore Group, a firm known for its Exchange-traded funds "Guggenheim ETFs".  and unit investment trusts "Guggenheim UITs". .[17] In December 2009, Guggenheim acquired a division of Wellmark and renamed it Guggenheim Life & Annuity.[18] In February 2010, Guggenheim Partners acquired Security Benefit Corp, parent company of Rydex Funds.[19] In October 2011, it acquired the life insurance company EquiTrust from FBL Financial Group.[20] In 2012, Guggenheim affiliates acquired the US annuities business of Canadian insurers Industrial Alliance and Sun Life Financial.[21][22]
In March 2012, Guggenheim Baseball Management acquired the Los Angeles Dodgers team for $2.15 billion in cash.[23] The consortium consisted of Guggenheim controlling partner Mark Walter, former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson and partners Peter Guber, Stan Kasten, Bobby Patton and Todd Boehly.[24] The acquisition includes the surrounding land and parking lot of Dodger Stadium.[25] Mark Walter said of the acquisition: "It's a lot of money, but if we do our jobs right...the long-term point of view is that people will see that the value was there."[26]
That September, Guggenheim bought a stake in the entertainment production company Dick Clark Productions,[27] which produces specials such as the American Music Awards and the Golden Globe Awards and other television programming.
In January 2013, the company bought out the remainder of the business-to-business media company Prometheus Global Media[28][29] and acquired CardCash in November of the same year.[30] In February 2014, Guggenheim Partners acquired the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA.[31]

According to the SEC, the firm's employees did not report dozens of trips on clients' private airplanes and had overbilled a client $6.5 million in fees, taking nearly two years to reimburse them.[13]
On December 17, 2015, it was reported that in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company would spin out its media properties into a new holding company owned by an investment group led by Guggenheim president Todd Boehly, consisting of Mediabistro, Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter, and Dick Clark Productions.[14][15]
Investments[edit]
In May 2009, Guggenheim Partners acquired a controlling interest in financial services firm Transparent Value LLC.[16] In July 2009, it acquired Claymore Group, a firm known for its Exchange-traded funds "Guggenheim ETFs".  and unit investment trusts "Guggenheim UITs". .[17] In December 2009, Guggenheim acquired a division of Wellmark and renamed it Guggenheim Life & Annuity.[18] In February 2010, Guggenheim Partners acquired Security Benefit Corp, parent company of Rydex Funds.[19] In October 2011, it acquired the life insurance company EquiTrust from FBL Financial Group.[20] In 2012, Guggenheim affiliates acquired the US annuities business of Canadian insurers Industrial Alliance and Sun Life Financial.[21][22]
In March 2012, Guggenheim Baseball Management acquired the Los Angeles Dodgers team for $2.15 billion in cash.[23] The consortium consisted of Guggenheim controlling partner Mark Walter, former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson and partners Peter Guber, Stan Kasten, Bobby Patton and Todd Boehly.[24] The acquisition includes the surrounding land and parking lot of Dodger Stadium.[25] Mark Walter said of the acquisition: "It's a lot of money, but if we do our jobs right...the long-term point of view is that people will see that the value was there."[26]
That September, Guggenheim bought a stake in the entertainment production company Dick Clark Productions,[27] which produces specials such as the American Music Awards and the Golden Globe Awards and other television programming.
In January 2013, the company bought out the remainder of the business-to-business media company Prometheus Global Media[28][29] and acquired CardCash in November of the same year.[30] In February 2014, Guggenheim Partners acquired the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA.[31]

Organization[edit]
Guggenheim Partners provides services across insurance services, investment banking, capital markets, strategic direction, investment management, merchant banking, and asset management. Guggenheim Investment Advisors oversees about $50 billion in assets.[4][5]
In June 2009, Guggenheim hired former Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz as Executive Chairman to "focus on transforming Guggenheim's existing broker-dealer, which is focused on sales and trading of fixed income securities, into a full-service investment banking enterprise".[6]
In September 2009, Guggenheim hired former Goldman Sachs partner Peter Comisar as Vice Chairman and Head of West Coast Investment Banking.[7] The West Coast Advisory team is also headed by Managing Directors from Bear Stearns, Moelis & Co and Credit Suisse. The West Coast team focuses on Consumer Retail and Digital E-Commerce advisory while the NY office houses the remaining industry verticals and product groups with the except of oil & gas, which is based out of Houston.
In October 2009, Guggenheim hired former J.P. Morgan head of Media Investment Banking Mark Van Lith as Senior Managing Director and Head of Investment Banking.[8]
In March 2012, Guggenheim hired former Apollo Global Management director and vice chairman Henry Silverman as vice chairman of asset management.[9]
In January 2013, Guggenheim named former Yahoo! interim CEO Ross Levinsohn as CEO of private equity unit Guggenheim Digital Media.[10]
In May & June 2013, the firm also hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s co-head of U.S. leveraged finance capital markets Tom Stein, former Barclays head of retail investment banking and vice chairman Andrew Taussig, as well as managing directors Spencer Hart, Matthew Pilla, Ken Harada and Ryan Mash.[11]
In September 2013, Guggenheim Securities was named a financial adviser to Verizon in connection with its $130 billion acquisition of Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless.[12]
Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, the investment arm of Guggenheim Partners, was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with failure to disclose a $50 million loan made in 2010 to a senior executive from a client. The firm paid $20 million in 2015 to settle the charges.[13] The government agency also found that Guggenheim's compliance program did not prevent violations of federal securities laws. According to the SEC, the firm's employees did not report dozens of trips on clients' private airplanes and had overbilled a client $6.5 million in fees, taking nearly two years to reimburse them.[13]
On December 17, 2015, it was reported that in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company would spin out its media properties into a new holding company owned by an investment group led by Guggenheim president Todd Boehly, consisting of Mediabistro, Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter, and Dick Clark Productions.[14][15]
Investments[edit]
In May 2009, Guggenheim Partners acquired a controlling interest in financial services firm Transparent Value LLC.[16] In July 2009, it acquired Claymore Group, a firm known for its Exchange-traded funds "Guggenheim ETFs".  and unit investment trusts "Guggenheim UITs". .[17] In December 2009, Guggenheim acquired a division of Wellmark and renamed it Guggenheim Life & Annuity.[18] In February 2010, Guggenheim Partners acquired Security Benefit Corp, parent company of Rydex Funds.[19] In October 2011, it acquired the life insurance company EquiTrust from FBL Financial Group.[20] In 2012, Guggenheim affiliates acquired the US annuities business of Canadian insurers Industrial Alliance and Sun Life Financial.[21][22]
In March 2012, Guggenheim Baseball Management acquired the Los Angeles Dodgers team for $2.15 billion in cash.[23] The consortium consisted of Guggenheim controlling partner Mark Walter, former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson and partners Peter Guber, Stan Kasten, Bobby Patton and Todd Boehly.[24] The acquisition includes the surrounding land and parking lot of Dodger Stadium.[25] Mark Walter said of the acquisition: "It's a lot of money, but if we do our jobs right...the long-term point of view is that people will see that the value was there."[26]
That September, Guggenheim bought a stake in the entertainment production company Dick Clark Productions,[27] which produces specials such as the American Music Awards and the Golden Globe Awards and other television programming.
In January 2013, the company bought out the remainder of the business-to-business media company Prometheus Global Media[28][29] and acquired CardCash in November of the same year.[30] In February 2014, Guggenheim Partners acquired the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA.[31]

Organization[edit]
Guggenheim Partners provides services across insurance services, investment banking, capital markets, strategic direction, investment management, merchant banking, and asset management. Guggenheim Investment Advisors oversees about $50 billion in assets.[4][5]
In June 2009, Guggenheim hired former Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz as Executive Chairman to "focus on transforming Guggenheim's existing broker-dealer, which is focused on sales and trading of fixed income securities, into a full-service investment banking enterprise".[6]
In September 2009, Guggenheim hired former Goldman Sachs partner Peter Comisar as Vice Chairman and Head of West Coast Investment Banking.[7] The West Coast Advisory team is also headed by Managing Directors from Bear Stearns, Moelis & Co and Credit Suisse. The West Coast team focuses on Consumer Retail and Digital E-Commerce advisory while the NY office houses the remaining industry verticals and product groups with the except of oil & gas, which is based out of Houston.
In October 2009, Guggenheim hired former J.P. Morgan head of Media Investment Banking Mark Van Lith as Senior Managing Director and Head of Investment Banking.[8]
In March 2012, Guggenheim hired former Apollo Global Management director and vice chairman Henry Silverman as vice chairman of asset management.[9]
In January 2013, Guggenheim named former Yahoo! interim CEO Ross Levinsohn as CEO of private equity unit Guggenheim Digital Media.[10]
In May & June 2013, the firm also hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s co-head of U.S. leveraged finance capital markets Tom Stein, former Barclays head of retail investment banking and vice chairman Andrew Taussig, as well as managing directors Spencer Hart, Matthew Pilla, Ken Harada and Ryan Mash.[11]
In September 2013, Guggenheim Securities was named a financial adviser to Verizon in connection with its $130 billion acquisition of Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless.[12]
Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, the investment arm of Guggenheim Partners, was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with failure to disclose a $50 million loan made in 2010 to a senior executive from a client. The firm paid $20 million in 2015 to settle the charges.[13] The government agency also found that Guggenheim's compliance program did not prevent violations of federal securities laws. According to the SEC, the firm's employees did not report dozens of trips on clients' private airplanes and had overbilled a client $6.5 million in fees, taking nearly two years to reimburse them.[13]
On December 17, 2015, it was reported that in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company would spin out its media properties into a new holding company owned by an investment group led by Guggenheim president Todd Boehly, consisting of Mediabistro, Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter, and Dick Clark Productions.[14][15]
Investments[edit]
In May 2009, Guggenheim Partners acquired a controlling interest in financial services firm Transparent Value LLC.[16] In July 2009, it acquired Claymore Group, a firm known for its Exchange-traded funds "Guggenheim ETFs".  and unit investment trusts "Guggenheim UITs". .[17] In December 2009, Guggenheim acquired a division of Wellmark and renamed it Guggenheim Life & Annuity.[18] In February 2010, Guggenheim Partners acquired Security Benefit Corp, parent company of Rydex Funds.[19] In October 2011, it acquired the life insurance company EquiTrust from FBL Financial Group.[20] In 2012, Guggenheim affiliates acquired the US annuities business of Canadian insurers Industrial Alliance and Sun Life Financial.[21][22]
In March 2012, Guggenheim Baseball Management acquired the Los Angeles Dodgers team for $2.15 billion in cash.[23] The consortium consisted of Guggenheim controlling partner Mark Walter, former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson and partners Peter Guber, Stan Kasten, Bobby Patton and Todd Boehly.[24] The acquisition includes the surrounding land and parking lot of Dodger Stadium.[25] Mark Walter said of the acquisition: "It's a lot of money, but if we do our jobs right...the long-term point of view is that people will see that the value was there."[26]
That September, Guggenheim bought a stake in the entertainment production company Dick Clark Productions,[27] which produces specials such as the American Music Awards and the Golden Globe Awards and other television programming.
In January 2013, the company bought out the remainder of the business-to-business media company Prometheus Global Media[28][29] and acquired CardCash in November of the same year.[30] In February 2014, Guggenheim Partners acquired the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA.[31]

Our Firm
Heritage of Success




For well over a century, the Guggenheim name has been synonymous with a spirit of innovation and a track record of results. Delivering innovative solutions to the complex challenges facing clients is a hallmark of Guggenheim’s legacy of success.


Our history stems from Guggenheim Brothers, the Guggenheim family business dating back to the late 1800s. Guggenheim Partners began with the mission of creating exceptional value for our clients by applying the principles that made the Guggenheim family one of the most successful innovators, investors, and business managers in American history.
Those principles entailed engaging highly talented people, challenging them to think creatively, and encouraging them to achieve extraordinarily high standards in their fields of expertise. Today, we continue to uphold the principles of the Guggenheim family by promoting a firm culture that values initiative, encourages ideas, and rewards success.




Family Milestones
 





1881


Meyer Guggenheim paid $5,000 for a one-third interest in two Colorado lead and silver mines. By the end of World War I, the family business controlled more than 80% of the world’s supply of silver, copper and lead.






1882


With four of his sons already engaged in the family business, Meyer Guggenheim formed M. Guggenheim’s Sons. The firm would later reorganize into Guggenheim Brothers.






1912


The Guggenheims created their own industrial relations bureau, dedicated to bringing reforms in the mining industry including pension plans, housing projects, hospitalization for employees, and accident compensation.






1929


Daniel Guggenheim embraced a vision of going where no man had gone before and, on the recommendation of Charles Lindbergh, bankrolled Robert Goddard’s obscure research on rockets. Goddard’s work eventually led to the development of modern rocketry.






1940


Alicia Patterson, Harry Guggenheim’s wife, founded the publication Newsday, a paper geared toward the rapidly growing suburban community of Long Island. Twenty-five years after it began publication, the circulation was 400,000 copies daily.






1941


Solomon Guggenheim engaged the respected architect Frank Lloyd Wright to design a unique contemporary art museum to display his vast personal collection of non-objective art. The partnering of these two visionaries resulted in one of the most famous and recognizable structures in the world, itself a work of non-objective art.





1953


Harry Guggenheim adhered to the family formula by enlisting the services of the most preeminent horse trainers of the time to successfully achieve his goal of winning the Kentucky Derby with a horse named Dark Star.






1964


The Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation issued a ten-year grant to the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution to aid in the development of exhibits and other museum activities.






1979


The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation took ownership of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, the first international institution in the Guggenheim collection of museums.






1980s


The Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation engaged three renowned land planners doing innovative work with neo-traditional town planning to collaboratively land plan Daniel Island, a 4,500-acre island near Charleston, SC.






1997


The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation together with the Basque government engaged the renowned architect Frank Gehry and challenged him to design a new Guggenheim Museum that would be so innovative and spectacular that it would transform Bilbao, Spain from a struggling city into a vibrant cultural destination.




 

Guggenheim Family Foundations
Several members of the Guggenheim family established foundations to serve a variety of cultural and scientific causes, including research and education in the arts and sciences.



Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation   



Established in 1924, the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation aimed to advance the well-being of mankind throughout the world. The Foundation provided two grants for rocketry education centers at Princeton and the California Institute of Technology, and created the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Aviation Safety Center at Cornell University. By 1960, the Center at Cornell had undertaken research on collision avoidance, crash fire prevention, occupant protection, altimeter and instrument error, and in-flight explosions. The Foundation also donated the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Space Theater to the American Museum of Natural History for use in conjunction with the Hayden Planetarium. The Foundation closed in 2011.





Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics   


Established in 1926 by Daniel and Harry Guggenheim, the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics focused on promoting aeronautical education in universities, colleges, and secondary schools, and among the general public; supporting the extension of fundamental aeronautical science; and assisting in the development of commercial aircraft and aircraft equipment. Among the accomplishments of the Fund were the establishment of eight schools of aeronautical engineering and making significant contributions to the development of commercial passenger-carrying air transport service in America, including the creation of the first commercial airline, run by Western Airline Express. The Fund also succeeded in engaging renowned names in the field of aviation, like Elmer Sperry and General Jimmy Doolittle, to improve upon various flight instruments to address the issues pilots flying in fog and other hazardous weather conditions, such as the turn and bank indicator, the artificial horizon, and the directional gyrocompass. The Fund closed down in 1930 after fulfilling its founding purposes.




John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation   


The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation awards fellowships to men and women who have demonstrated exceptional capacity for productive scholarship or exceptional creative ability in the arts. Guggenheim fellows have been recipients of numerous prestigious awards including 112 Nobel prizes and over 220 Pulitzers. Additionally, Guggenheim fellows have won 169 National Book Awards, recognizing the best in American Literature, and 10 Fields Medals, the highest scientific award for mathematics. Notable recipients of Guggenheim Fellowships include Langston Hughes, Martha Graham, Ansel Adams, Alice Walker, Allen Ginsburg, Mary McCarthy, Vladimir Nabokov, Henry Kissinger, John Updike, and Cormac McCarthy.




Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation   


The Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation sponsors scholarly research on problems of violence, aggression, and dominance, and also encourages related research projects in neuroscience, genetics, animal behavior, the social sciences, history, criminology, and the humanities. Grants have been made to study aspects of violence related to youth, family relationships, media effects, crime, biological factors, intergroup conflict related to religion, ethnicity, and nationalism, political violence deployed in war and sub-state terrorism, as well as processes of peace and the control of aggression. The Foundation has supported Jane Goodall’s research into the lives of Chimpanzees in Tanzania, studies of cooperation and conflict in Israeli kibbutzim, and the role of dominance in children’s cultures.




Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation   


The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation is committed to innovation by collecting, preserving, and interpreting modern and contemporary art, while simultaneously exploring ideas across cultures through exhibitions, educational and curatorial initiatives, publications, and digital platforms. Dedicated to engaging both local and global audiences, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation has built an international community of architecturally and culturally distinct museums. Initiated in the 1970’s by the addition of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, this international network has since incorporated the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (opened 1997), the Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin (1997–2013), and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, currently in development. Each museum in the Guggenheim collection combines distinguished architecture with great artworks, a tradition that has become a Guggenheim hallmark.

Guggenheim Investments ETFs may not be suitable for all investors. • Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Most investors will also incur customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of an ETF. • Investments in securities and derivatives, in general, are subject to market risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate over time. • ETF Shares may trade below their net asset value ("NAV"). The NAV of shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of an ETF's holdings. In addition, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares will develop or be maintained. • Please review a prospectus carefully for more information of the risks associated with each ETF.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Best Online Brokers

Barron’s 2017 Best Online Broker Ranking
Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels


 







By

Theresa W. Carey

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...
