Amateur career[edit]
Mr. Ohio, Gregory played high-school basketball at Independence High School in Columbus, Ohio. He played college basketball at the University of Kansas, where he played with the Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team from 1997 to 2001.
Pro career[edit]
Despite a very large wingspan for a guard of 6'11" (2.11 m) and some very impressive athletic scores at the 2001 NBA pre-draft camp, such as recording the highest no-step vertical jump (40") and the highest maximum vertical jump (46") that have ever been measured at the camp, Gregory went undrafted in the 2001 NBA draft.[1]
Gregory was then signed for the 2001-02 season by the Greenville Groove of the D-League. He played the 2002 summer season with the Dodge City Legend in the United States Basketball League before moving to the British Basketball League for the 2002-03 season, where he played with the Chester Jets. He then moved to Italy for the 2003-04 season to the team Nuova Pallacanestro Pavia, of the Italian Second Division League.
He moved to the French League for the 2005-06 season, to the team Le Mans Sarthe Basket. He played with Le Mans during the 2006-07 season as well. He then moved to the Turkish League for the 2007-08 season, where he played with Efes Pilsen S.K..[2]
Gregory moved to the Greek League club PAOK BC for the 2008-09 season.[3] In February 2009, and as PAOK BC was facing financial problems, he moved to the ACB to play for Pamesa Valencia, only to return to the Greek League in the summer of 2009, again for PAOK BC.
In September 2010 he signed with KK Union Olimpija.
In December 2011 he signed with SLUC Nancy Basket.[4]

General Cable Announces New Chief Executive Officer | Business Wire
























































General Cable Announces New Chief Executive Officer






June 08, 2015 04:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



HIGHLAND HEIGHTS, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--General Cable Corporation (NYSE: BGC) today announced that its 
      Board of Directors has named Michael T. McDonnell as President and Chief 
      Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors, effective July 
      1, 2015. Mr. McDonnell, who was previously Chairman, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer at TPC Group, will succeed Gregory B. Kenny, who has 
      led the Company since 2001 as President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. 
      Kenny will retire as of July 1, 2015, but will remain available to Mr. 
      McDonnell and to the Board in an advisory capacity through year-end. 
      John E. Welsh, III will remain Chairman of the Board.
    


      “After a comprehensive search that included a number of highly qualified 
      candidates, we are pleased to name Mike as the new President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of General Cable,” said John E. Welsh, III, Chairman 
      of the Board. “Mike is an experienced chief executive officer with a 
      proven record of driving performance improvement, delivering long-term 
      growth strategies and enhancing organizational/cultural alignment in 
      both public company and private equity environments. Our Board of 
      Directors unanimously concluded that Mike is best suited to lead General 
      Cable into the future. We have made substantial progress on our 
      previously announced divestiture and restructuring programs focused on 
      simplifying our geographic portfolio, reducing operational complexity 
      and delivering increased returns from our core assets in North America, 
      Europe and Latin America. We believe Mike is well suited to continue to 
      build on this momentum and further strengthen General Cable’s position 
      in order to deliver long-term value for our shareholders, employees and 
      customers.”
    

      Mr. McDonnell, 58, most recently served as Chairman, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of TPC Group, a $2.5 billion leading processor and 
      producer of value-added products derived from petrochemicals that are 
      sold into a wide range of performance, specialty and intermediate

      leading over the past four years where together with the Board and 
      management team we have built a stronger organization and delivered 
      long-term value for all stakeholders. I expect to do the same at General 
      Cable and look forward to working closely with the Board of Directors, 
      executive team and talented and hard-working associates to continue to 
      foster a culture of success. Greg’s leadership has been instrumental in

      for his unwavering commitment and dedication to General Cable,” said 
      Welsh. “Greg has worked for General Cable for 32 years and served the 
      last 14 years as President and CEO. He has been a selfless leader, a 
      great business partner and Board member and has led the transformation 
      of General Cable into a global leader in the wire and cable industry. It 
      has been a privilege to serve on the Board with Greg. We are pleased 
      Greg will be available to work together with Mike and with the Board to 
      ensure a successful transition.”
