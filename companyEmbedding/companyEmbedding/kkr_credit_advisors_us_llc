Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
    
Starting Quarter:
      
All Available Dates


  Ending Quarter:

The article is called Willbros Group Inc Kkr Credit Advisors (Us) Llc Bought New Stake and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/willbros-group-inc-kkr-credit-advisors-us-llc-bought-new-stake/27390/.CaptchaSubmitKkr Credit Advisors (Us) Llc New Position in Willbros Group Inc (NYSE:WG)
Kkr Credit Advisors (Us) Llc has filled a SC 13D form regarding Willbros Group, Inc  2.06 +0.01 0.49%. Per Kkr Credit Advisors (Us) Llc’s filling, the filler now owns 16.6% of the Energy-company, holding 10,125,410 shares.

Why Kkr Credit Advisors (Us) Llc Bought Willbros Group, Inc
Purpose of Transaction






KKR   Credit US indirectly serves as investment advisor to certain entities (or   parents of certain entities), including KKR Lending II, that are lenders (the   KKR Lenders) under the Credited Agreement dated as of December15,   2014 among the Issuer, as borrower, the guarantors from time to time party   thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank,   N.A., as administrative agent, and KKR Credit US, as sole lead arranger and   sole bookrunner (the Credit Agreement).
On   March31, 2015, the parties to the Credit Agreement agreed to an   amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment). The Amendment amended certain covenants   under the Credit Agreement to provide relief to the Issuer, and it also   granted board observer rights and board representation rights to the KKR   Lenders. The KKR Lenders may designate   one representative acceptable to the Nominating/Corporate Governance   Committee (the Nominating Committee) of the Issuers Board of   Directors (the Board) as an observer to attend and observe (but not   vote) at all meetings of the Board and any committee thereof (the Board   Observer Right). Additionally,   upon written notice of the KKR Lenders to the Issuer, the Board will take all   appropriate action to expand the Board by one board seat (unless there is an   existing vacancy on the Board) and cause a designee nominated by the KKR   Lenders and acceptable to the Nominating Committee (the KKR Designee)   to be elected to the Board to fill such vacancy (the Board Representation   Right). As of March31,   2015, the KKR Lenders have not exercised their Board Representation Right,   but they have the right to do so at anytime.   If the KKR Lenders exercise their Board Representation Right, then   they will cease to have the Board Observer Right. If KKR Credit US and its affiliates cease   to hold at least 5% of the outstanding Common Stock, the Board Representation   Right and the Board Observer Right will terminate.
The KKR Lenders have   exercised their Board Observer Right, and, accordingly, they, acting through   KKR Credit US, may have influence over the Issuers corporate   activities. Additionally, if the KKR   Lenders were to exercise their Board Representation Right, then the KKR   Designee may have influence over the Issuers corporate activities. Such influence may relate to multiple   facets of the Issuers operations, including without limitation, the Issuers   obligations under the Credit Agreement, the Issuers capitalization and the   transactions described in paragraphs (a)through (j)of Item 4 of   Schedule 13D. Furthermore, as the   indirect investment advisor to

KKR Income Opportunities Fund seeks to dynamically allocate across credit instruments to capitalize on changes in relative value among corporate credit investments and manage against macroeconomic risks. The Fund is designed to offer investors:

Investment experience of KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, the Fund’s investment adviser, which is a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., a leading global investment firm with a 40-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence
Potential for attractive levels of current income through monthly distributions
A targeted portfolio investing primarily in bank loans and high yield securities
KKR Credit's consistent approach and robust credit investment process that seeks to adapt credit strategies to market conditions

KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC serves as KKR Income Opportunities Fund’s investment adviser (the “Adviser”). Launched in 2004, the Adviser is a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (together with the Adviser and its other affiliates, “KKR”). The Adviser’s investment teams, which are organized by industry, invest across the capital structure with the goal of achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns and protecting capital. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s investment objectives of seeking a high level of current income with a secondary objective of capital appreciation will be achieved or that the Fund’s investment program will be successful.
An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. The Fund’s investment policy of investing primarily in bank loans and high yield securities, including special situations opportunities, involves certain risks. Investors could lose some or all of their investment.
The securities in which the Fund will invest may be rated below investment grade. Such securities are regarded as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to an issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal and are commonly referred to as “high yield” securities or “junk” bonds.
For a summary of the risks associated with an investment in the Fund, please see the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus. The Fund intends to use leverage. Leverage involves the use of various financial instruments or borrowings in an attempt to increase the return of an investment. The use of leverage involves risk, including the potential for higher volatility and greater declines of the Fund’s net asset value, and fluctuations of dividends and other distributions paid by the Fund. For additional risk information, see the “Leverage” section of the prospectus.
Risks: For information regarding the risks associated with an investment in the Fund, including, No operating history, Investment and market risk, Market discount risk, Leverage risk, Fixed-Income Instruments risk, Senior Loans risk, Credit risk, Subordianted and Unsecured or Partially Secured Loans risk, Mezzanie securities risk, Below Investment Grade Instruments risk, Special Situations risk, Short selling risk, Prepayment risk, Credit Derivatives risk, Derivatives risk, Income risk, Regulatory risk, Risks related to the Fund’s clearing broker and central clearing counterparty, Structured Products risk, Repurchase Agreements risk, Reverse Repurchase Agreements and Dollar Rolls risk, Swap risk, Options and Futures risk, Exchange-Traded Funds risk, Counterparty risk, Counterparty and Prime Brokerage risk, Lender Liability risk, Distressed Debt, Litigation, Bankruptcy and Other Proceedings, Convertible Securities risk, When-Issued Securities and Forward Commitments, Risk of Investments in Equity Securities or Warrants Incidental to Investments in Loans and Fixed-Income Instruments, U.S. Government Debt Securities risk, Non-U.S. Securities risk, Foreign Currency risk, Eurozone risk, Legal and Regulatory risk, Event Driven Investing, Valuation risk, Liquidity risk, Inflation/Deflation risk, Conflicts of Interest risk, Tax risk, Uncertain Tax Treatment, Complex Transactions/ Contingent Liabilities/Guarantees and Indemnities, Dependence on Key Personnel risk, Material Risks of Significant Methods of Analysis, Non-Diversification Risk, Market Developments, Market Disruptions from Natural Disasters or Geopolitical risks, Government Intervention in the Financial Markets, Portfolio Turnover risk, Anti-Takeover Provisions, Risks Relating to Fund’s RIC Status, RIC-Related Risks of Investments Generating Non-Cash Taxable Income, please see “Investment objective, policies and risks” in the Fund’s prospectus.
