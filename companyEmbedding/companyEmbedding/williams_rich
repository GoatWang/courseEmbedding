	The GHS is an acronym for The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. The GHS is a system for standardizing and harmonizing the classification and labelling of chemicals. Chemicals are associated with codes that define their health, physical and environmental hazards.This universal hazard communication system was developed to ensure that employers, employees and consumers are provided with adequate, practical, reliable and comprehensible information on the hazards of chemicals, so that they can take effective preventive and protective measure for their own health and safety.
	The GHS classifications for chemicals associated with products in this database may be viewed by selecting the "Advanced" button on the Chemical Ingredients tables. Since this is a work in progress, GHS classifications may not be shown for all chemical ingredients.

Ethylbenzene is classified by IARC as possibly carcinogenic to humans
(2B) based on inadequate evidence in humans and sufficient evidence in
laboratory animals. Lifetime inhalation exposure of rats and mice to high

These effects were not observed in animals exposed to lower concentrations.
There is no evidence that ethylbenzene causes cancer in humans.
Prolonged overexposure to solvent ingredients in Section 2 may cause
adverse effects to the liver, urinary and reproductive systems.
Reports have associated repeated and prolonged overexposure to solvents
with permanent brain and nervous system damage.
