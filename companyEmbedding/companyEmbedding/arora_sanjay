Daddy’s Little Dynamos – Sanjana Arora

				Text by Nasrin Modak-Siddiqi. Photograph by Tejal Pandey			

 Verve interacts with corporate czarinas who are ardently nurturing their legacies
 












SANJANA ARORA, Creative Head, D’Decor
Biggest influence
My hardworking mother and father (Ina and Sanjay Arora) with a flair for fashion, trends, colour and designs have been a great influence. I also look up to Amancio Ortega for introducing a fast fashion trend and delivering
an extraordinary value of a highly diverse variety of products to low cost countries.
Living the big name
It has its pluses and minuses. But being brought up in a business family, I always ate, breathed and heard business. It’s a challenge that motivates me to work hard and achieve great success.
On dealing with seniors who worked with Dad
I utilise their wisdom, knowledge and inputs to better my business skills, even though I do give my opinion to them, as we often think differently.
Moment of truth
My journey pretty much began from the time of my birth. At the age of four, I told my father I would like to work with him. But I have my own product which today is my independent retail venture.
Corporate challenges
Coping with the cost of rentals for retail, dealing with fast moving change in employees and training new entrants to the team.
Vision for the company
I am focussing on setting up 11 D’Decor stores in India, hopefully taking the business venture overseas, too.
Style quotient
Keep it simple and minimal.
Mantra for success
To deliver true value and great service and design.
Level of tech-savviness
The handshake between Operations and IT is my forte. I am instrumental in formulating the IT system at the D’Decor store in Bandra, Mumbai, and mapping the operations and processes involved in it.
On being a woman leader
I don’t really have any gender apprehensions. I am working with a new, young and educated team, so it is easy to communicate as colleague to colleague and not woman to man.
Preferred corporate attire
Simple and neutral. No bling, since it would not exude a professional attitude.
Style inspiration
My school principal and mentor, Nita Ambani. I adore her style which is elegant and subtle.
Lessons learnt
Patience, listening to the other person and not keeping an overly aggressive attitude. Share opinions when necessary.
Most loved designers
Armani and Dolce & Gabbana.
De-stressing formulae
A swim, a run or a game of tennis can work wonders.
Animal love
I have a pet dog but would want to own a horse some day.
Favourite read
Men of Steel and Chicken Soup for the Soul.
Fashion is
Being at par with the latest trends and sticking to what you feel confident in. Style should reflect your personality.
In my free time
I love watching movies and catching up with my close friends.
Personal fetish
Christian Dior bags.
Much-loved shopping destination
London and Milan.
