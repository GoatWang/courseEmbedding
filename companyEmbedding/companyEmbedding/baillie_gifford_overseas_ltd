                Accessibility
            


We recognise the importance of making our website accessible for all our users.  The following details how we have approached accessibility on www.bailliegifford.com.  
 
Navigation
All areas of our website are available through accessible links. Any user who has javascript disabled will be able to access all areas of the site regardless. Our navigation is accessible through screen readers to make it available to all users.
 
Headings and navigation menus
HTML heading tags are used to convey document structure. H1 tags are used for main titles, H2 tags for subtitles etc.
Navigation menus are marked up as HTML lists. This ensures that the number of links in the list is read out at the start and it can be skipped easily.
 
Images
All images used in this site include descriptive alt tag attributes. Where an image has no use other than being decorative the alt tag is set to null to allow easy reading of the site by all users.
 
Colours
We have taken care to ensure that the site's font and background colour combinations contrast significantly and are effective in ensuring information is still clear when viewed in different colour combinations.
If you wish to override the site's colours, you can do this by changing your browser settings to your own preference.
 
Font size
Most of the font sizes we use on our site are sizable. You can change the font size to make it either larger or smaller via your browser settings.
You can change the font size in the following ways depending on your browser;

In Internet Explorer; select View, then Text Size, and then your preferred size.
In FireFox; select View, then Zoom, and then Zoom in or Zoom out to alter the text size.
In Safari; click on display icon (top right) and select Zoom, Click Zoom in or Zoom out to change font size.

 
Stylesheets
This site uses cascading style sheets for all visual layout. If your browser or browsing device does not support stylesheets at all, the use of structured semantic mark up ensures that the content of each page is still readable and clearly structured.
You can apply your own stylesheet onto this website by;

Internet Explorer; select Tools, then Internet Options, then Accessibility, next click on any or all 3 checkboxes to ignore colours, font styles or font sizes, in the same window you can change your style sheet by clicking the checkbox that says, 'format document using my style sheet' then browse to your style sheet and click OK.
In Firefox; select Main Menu, then View and then Page Style and No Style. Select Basic Page Style to restore the page styling. 
In Safari; click on the Develop in the main menu and Disable Styles.
Note: If the Develop Menu item isn’t available on the main menu, then Select preferences in the Display a Menu of General Safari Settings and click on Preferences. Select the Advanced Tab and click on Show Develop menu in bar

 
Tables
Most data tables have properly scoped header cells, to allow screen readers to render them intelligently. We have also ensured table summaries are used as well as captions where appropriate. Tables used for layout use none of the above attributes to ensure that they are not confused with data tables.
 
Forms and fields
All forms fields follow a logical tab sequence to ensure easy navigation.
Most form fields also have ‘label’ and ‘id’ attributes to explicitly associate the form field with its label to allow for easy entry of data.
 
JavaScript
This site uses JavaScript to render some areas of the site, including tools and navigation items. Where it is used all pages and process are still accessible should Javascript be turned off.
 
Links
All links have been written to make sense when taken out of context. Where appropriate, we have also added link title attributes to describe the link in greater detail.
 
Copy
Abbreviation and acronym tags have been used where appropriate to ensure abbreviations and acronyms are given a full textual explanation.
We have also ensured that blockquotes are only ever used for identifying quotations. They are not used for formatting purposes.

California State Teachers' Retirement System


                                                                                     •  West Sacramento, CA                                                                            

                                        The California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) is administered by a 12-member Teachers' Retirement Board. Their Investment Committee's objectives are set forth in the California Constitution and the California Education Code. The Teachers Retirement Fund is a special trust fund established by law that holds the assets of the following programs: Defined Benefit, Defined Benefit Supplement and Cash Balance Benefit. The assets come from contributions by members, employing school districts and the State of California. The funds investments create a stream of income to add to those assets. The CalSTRS portfolio has broadly diversified holdings in seven categories: Global Equity, Fixed Income, Real Estate, Private Equity, Cash, Inflation Sensitive and Overlay. CalSTRS often engages in shareholder activism.
                                    




The California Public Employees' Retirement System


                                                                                     •  Sacramento, CA                                                                            

                                        The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) assets are managed by the CalPERS Board of Administration. CalPERS invests across a range of asset classes including real estate, infrastructure, forest land, commodities, inflation-linked bonds, fixed-income, private equity, global public equity and nominal government bonds and cash. Strategies are managed both internally and through external managers.^CalPERS' absolute return program utilizes absolute return funds to capitalize on investment opportunities not available using traditional approaches to investing in public markets. The program's objective is to enhance CalPERS' total fund return while diversifying total fund risk.^CalPERS' Global Equity Strategy is managed as an overall composite portfolio combining an index-oriented core with actively managed portfolios. Investments are managed from the view of relative return and risk as compared to the overall strategic benchmark. The strategy incorporates CalPERS' values in investing to influence ESG, as long as such influence is consistent with maximizing long-term, risk adjusted returns.^Their Dollar Denominated Fixed-Income Program seeks to exceed the return of the BCLL Index while maintaining a high level of diversification. CalPERS invests across bond market sectors where risks are understood and manageable. CalPERS' International Fixed Income Program seeks to exceed the return of the BCIFI Index. The strategy focuses on maximizing risk adjusted returns through the selection and allocation of permissible bond markets. Maturities, durations, credits, currencies and derivative instruments are carefully managed. CalPERS also invests in global debt issued by national governments. Their Dollar Denominated Short-Term Program seeks opportunities in the short end of the yield curve with manageable risks, while maintaining liquidity, credit quality, weighted average days to maturity and diversification. Their Dollar Denominated Fixed Income Limited Duration Program includes the High Quality LIBOR program and the Short Duration strategy. The High Quality LIBOR Program is a limited duration, highly liquid program that invests in limited duration assets that provide low volatility vs. a floating-rate based benchmark. The Short Duration Program seeks to earn a return premium vs. traditional limited duration assets through a modest increase in portfolio duration and by purchasing a broader universe of limited duration securities than is available to traditional money market portfolios.^CalPERS' TIPS Program seeks a duration that is similar to the duration of the Barclays Capital Global Real: US TIPS Index. Investments may include US TIPS, nominal US Treasury Securities and short term-investment funds (STIF).^CalPERS' Liquidity Programs are designed to provide liquid assets that can be converted to cash during market downturns, to provide a partial hedge to liabilities and to provide diversification. Their US Treasury 2-10 Year Program invests in US Treasury securities (including futures whose deliverable instrument is a US Treasury security) as well as STIFs from a custodial bank or internal CalPERS STIFs.
                                    




New York State Teachers' Retirement System


                                                                                     •  Albany, NY                                                                            

                                        New York State Teachers Retirement System (NYSTRS) invests the System's funds in a diverse range of classes of assets including domestic equities, international equities, domestic fixed-income, real estate, mortgages, alternative investments, global bonds and short-term investments/cash equivalents. They seek to earn the highest possible long-term rate of return within appropriate risk levels. In turn, this enables them to pay guaranteed benefits to members and their beneficiaries at the lowest possible cost to participating employers and the taxpayers that fund them. Derivatives may only be used to implement asset allocation changes in a cost-effective manner, prudently implement investment strategies in a risk controlled manner or reduce transaction costs or taxes. Derivatives may not be used to create leverage. Portfolios may be internally or eternally managed. External investment managers/advisors may invest System assets in commingled funds including bank collective investment trusts.
