	Motor Yacht Cruiser Boats Buyers Guide | Discover Boating




















































Follow @discoverboating



motor yacht/cruisers



back to boat types



Looking for the good life on the water? For many, the dream scene is aboard a motor yacht, a vessel typically 40 feet long or longer that’s powered by powerful single or twin engines. Lately some have been equipped with two to four pod drives, giving added maneuverability and joystick steering for close quarters. These are the boats that make voyages from continent to continent and ply large rivers or the Great Lakes. Generated electricity, air conditioning, and complete plumbing provide all the comforts of home, while amidst far-off adventures. Launch systems are often available to deploy personal watercraft and tenders as need and desire dictate.Yachts and cruisers are often set up to be captained from either of two locations: a conventional helm or set of controls in the cabin and another on a ‘fly bridge’ or elevated platform.Want to dream bigger yet? Superyachts start at about 100 feet and much of that additional space is dedicated to even more luxurious accommodations. Staterooms, walk-in closets, full-size and panoramic windows — and crew quarters — are the norm.

Powered primarily by outboard engines, this type of boat offers both tiller and remote steering options.

High performance boats are the sleek sports cars of the boating world, offering high speeds and precise handling to boaters who prefer their thrills full throttle. Marrying big horsepower with sleek hulls results in boats that are equally at home slicing through ocean swells or tearing up inland lakes. Cranking offshore or simply relaxing in a cove, performance boats deliver lots of smiles per hour.

Sailboats differ from other types of boats in that they are propelled partly or entirely by wind; they use sails to transform the power of the wind into power that moves the boat through the water. The term sailboat covers a wide variety of sailing craft, each with its own characteristics and styles. In general, sailboats are distinguished by size, hull configuration, keel type, number of sails, use and purpose. To learn more about a specific type of sailboat, click on a category below.

                                           Under the terms and conditions you:
                                            














    ﻿


Coverage Start Date

            The effective date of your policy can range from 1-60 days in the future. This is the date your coverage will begin. 
        


Agreed Hull Value Coverage

            Agreed Hull Value Coverage is the most protection you can buy. In the event of a total loss, you are paid the boat's value, as "agreed upon" 
            by our underwriters at the time you purchase the policy, with no deductible. Also, if your boat is brand new (under a year old) 
            and is a total loss, it qualifies for new boat replacement coverage. For other (partial) losses, your policy pays the reasonable 
            cost of repairs and replacement parts. It's important to note that all materials will be subject to depreciation once the boat 
            reaches 20 years of age. With an Agreed Hull Value policy, you pay more premium up front for total protection, 
            but less out of pocket expense in the event of a claim. 
        


Actual Cash Value Coverage

            Actual Cash Value Coverage is an economical option for boaters who want 
            to save on premium and pay more out of pocket for repairs in the event of a claim. 
            In the event of a total loss, you will be paid the current market value of your boat. 
            In the event of a partial loss, in addition to paying the deductible, all materials will 
            be subject to depreciation once the boat reaches 20 years of age.
        


Liability Only Coverage

            Liability Only Coverage If you are looking for a lower cost option, you may want to consider our 
            Liability Plus Policy. This policy provides the essential coverages you need without the added cost 
            of expensive hull coverage, though you take on the cost to repair or replace your boat in the event of a claim. 
        


TowBoatU.S. Towing

            Select Unlimited Towing by TowBoatU.S. - With the average cost of a water tow over $700, selecting the Unlimited TowBoatU.S.
            Towing endorsement provides you with service from the TowBoatU.S. nationwide towing fleet and includes 24/7 dispatch with
            payments directly to the service provider. If there is no TowBoatU.S. company in your local waterway, assistance is dispatched
            from a local tower, and you are reimbursed up to $3,000.

            Service includes towing, battery jumps, fuel delivery and soft ungroundings for offshore breakdowns that begin and end within
            the local TowBoatU.S. Service Area.  All TowBoatU.S. companies offer a minimum service area of 25 miles from their homeport
            with many companies offering larger service areas.  Tows that begin or end outside the local TowBoatU.S. Service Area will
            be covered up to $3,000.

            NOTE: With your insured trailer, Roadside Assistance is included for breakdowns while trailering your boat and covers 24/7
            dispatch, towing for up to 100 miles to the nearest repair facility or safe location, flat tire assistance, battery jumps
            and fuel delivery for the tow vehicle and/or boat trailer. Select trailer coverage for Roadside Assistance.

            Select the $250 level of towing and we’ll provide you with reimbursement of up to $250 per incident for water towing or
            roadside assistance while trailering your boat.
        


Named Storm Deductible

            The following applies to boats located in the states of TX, LA, MS, AL, FL, GA, NC, SC, the Bahamas,
            the Caribbean or Mexico: In the event of any loss caused directly or indirectly by a storm named by
            the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the deductible subtracted from each loss,
            whether partial or total loss, will be $1,000, or 5% of the amount shown for Boat & Boating Equipment,
            whichever shall be the greatest.
        


Boating Liability

            Provides coverage for third party property damage or bodily injury, caused by you or your boat for which 
            you're found legally liable.
        


Fuel and Spill

            This additional liability covers unintentional discharge of oil or fuel that can occur in a sinking, 
            fire, collision, grounding, etc. This "green coverage" is important now that federal and state 
            law subject boaters to liability for cleanup, containment, and environmental damage. This coverage is 
            provided in addition to the policy's normal liability coverage.
        


Family Medical Payments

            Covers out-of-pocket medical expenses for injuries occurring on board your boat.
        


Personal Effects

            Coverage of non-boating related items you carry on board, such as clothing, cameras and fishing gear.
        


Uninsured Boater Protection

            Provides coverage for injuries caused by an accident that you are entitled to recover 
            from the owner or operator of an uninsured boat or "hit-and-run" boat.
        


Commercial Towing Assistance

            Enables you to be reimbursed for the reasonable costs incurred when you 
            breakdown at sea or on the road and need a commercial tow to port.
        


Premier Package

            A package of valuable extras for one low price including $10,000 per incident Medical Limits, 
            $5,000 in Personal Effects Coverage, a lowered Electronics Deductible (to $250), and Ice and 
            Freezing coverage. Add $75 to your premium.
        


Lower Dinghy Deductible

            Dinghy Option will reduce the deductible applicable to losses to your dinghy and its outboard to $100; 
            without it, the 'Hull and Equipment Deductible' above will apply. This option is available for dinghy under 
            15 feet with under 30 horsepower that are used strictly as tenders for your boat. If the boat is used 
            for other purpose or is larger you may need a separate policy.
        


Lower Electronics Deductible

            Low Electronics Option will reduce the deductible applicable to losses to the boat’s navigational 
            electronics to $250; without it, the 'Hull and Equipment Deductible' above will apply. 
        


Ice & Freezing

            With the BoatU.S. Yacht Endorsement, coverage is included for damage from ice or freezing while 
            the boat is stored or used in AL, AZ, CA, FL, GA, HI, LA, MS, NM, NC, OR, SC, TX & WA. 
        


Water Sports Package
