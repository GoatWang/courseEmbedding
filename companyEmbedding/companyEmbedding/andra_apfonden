 Asset management
Over time, the Second AP Fund deems that some 90 percent of its return derives entirely from market exposure of its strategic benchmark, the remaining 10 percent being generated through active portfolio management.
The reason the Second AP Fund complements direct market exposure with active management derives from its brief to maximize return while maintaining a low level of risk. This strategy is also based on the Fund's perception of how capital markets function and on the potential for generating portfolio returns. This strategy has been formulated in a number of 'Investments Beliefs', These describe the Fund's view of the way capital markets function and the opportunities presented for generating a return on investment. These principles may be grouped under three main headings.
1. The way the capital market functions
In principle, asset management offers two main ways of generating value. The first is to establish an effective portfolio of asset classes that over time capture the risk premiums available on the financial markets. The second is to practice active management. The latter assumes an ability to locate temporary price inefficiencies, based on the recognition that no market is entirely effective.There is also fundamental consensus that share values, over time, tend to revert to their mean value and that longterm risk cannot be compared to shortterm risk. Trends the equity market in recent years are a case in point. Portfolio diversification by mixing assets and management strategies is thought to increase overall returns without raising the total level of risk in the Fund's portfolio.
2. Long-term thinking yields advantages
As a long-term investor, the Second AP Fund is better able to bear the risk arising from short-term market fluctuations. The Fund's brief also enables investment in a broader range of asset classes compared to other market players. As investor, the Second AP Fund is allowed to acquire illiquid assets, diversifying risk while simultaneously offering expectations of a higher return. Furthermore, long-term investment enables investors to practice active governance, to add value to the portfolio.
3. Conditions for success
The Fund must consistently attract, develop and retain competent staff. Exceptional financial competence and investment insight are crucial in enabling active management and in creating value that outperforms passive market returns. Structured and efficient processes aredecisive in ensuring that we benefit fully from the specialist competence represented by our staff. A structured approach makes it possible to speedily identify – and act on – new information.

 About AP2
With about SEK 300 billion under management in virtually every asset class and all parts of the world, the Second AP Fund is one of northern Europe's largest pension funds. A secure and stable manager of assets, the Fund is tasked with an important assignment by the Swedish Government – maximizing the long-term return on Swedish pension assets.




The Second AP Fund is one of five buffer funds within the Swedish pension system. The Second AP Fund shall maximize longterm return at low risk. In conjunction with the other buffer funds, the Fund is tasked with maintaining reasonably consistent pension levels, even during periods affected by peaks in the number of retirees, or by an economic downturn.
The Second AP Fund shall adopt a longterm approach, with a view to securing the managed buffer capital over the long-term. The Fund's scientifically-based strategic management model includes long-term forecasts covering demographic, socio-economic and capital-market developments.
Strategic management model
The Fund's strategic management model is based on financial theory and incorporates long-term forecasts covering demographic, socio-economic and capital-market developments. Despite the turbulent financial markets of the past 10–15 years, the Fund's performance has proved solid, both in absolute terms and in comparison with similar funds, whether seen from a national or international perspective.
Cost-efficient fund management
The Second AP Fund is an efficient manager. Seen in an international context, the Fund's management costs are on a par with those of similar funds. The Fund works consistently to reduce administrative costs where possible – without comprising its focus on an optimal return.
An attractive place to work – with exceptional competence

GÖTEBORG, Sweden, June 07, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --








In the 15 years that the Second AP Fund has published a Female Representation Index, the proportion of women on boards has increased by 26.1 percentage points. The Female Representation Index for 2017 shows that the proportion of women represented on the boards of companies listed on NASDAQ Stockholm continues to increase and is now at 32.2 percent compared with 30.7 percent the previous year. The proportion of women in executive positions is also increasing and in this year's survey it was 21.7 (20.9) percent. Large-cap companies account for the largest proportion of women on boards and in executive positions with 37.1 percent and 24.9 percent respectively.
"We can see how the pace of change is accelerating and 41.9 percent of newly elected board members today are women. At the same pace of change as the last four years, it will take 11 years for boards to comprise 50 percent women, and 24 years for 50 percent of executive positions to be filled by women. I think it shows that nominating committees and companies are well on the way to achieving gender equality on boards and management groups, irrespective of legislation," says Eva Halvarsson, CEO of Second AP Fund.
"However, the percentage difference between the proportion of women in executive positions and as board members has increased for the fourth consecutive year from 9.8 percent in 2016 to 10.5 percent in 2017 and is the largest since the surveys began. Our task now is to continue the work and not to lose momentum," says Halvarsson.
The proportion of women on the boards of all listed companies on NASDAQ Stockholm, excluding CEOs, is 33.8 (32.4) percent while for primary listed companies it is 35.2 (33.6) percent.
Large-cap companies account for the largest proportion of women on boards and in executive positions with 37.1 percent and 24.9 percent respectively. Excluding CEOs, the proportion of women on the boards of Large-cap companies is 39.5 percent and 42.0 percent for primary listed Large-cap companies.
Of the 305 companies in the survey, 224 have at least 25 percent women on the board compared with 202 companies in 2016. At 22 companies there are no women board members and 82 companies have no women in executive positions. The proportion of women who are chairs and CEOs also remains low at 6.2 (6.3) percent and 4.9 (5.2) percent.
The Financial Services sector has the highest proportion of women on its boards, 38.5 percent and 34.3 percent respectively. The Financial Services sector also has highest proportion of women in executive positions, 30.6 percent and 29.0 percent respectively. Lowest proportion of women are in the Public Utility sector followed by Oil & Gas.
Background to the Second AP Fund's Female Representation Index
The Second AP-fund has since 2003 conducted an annual survey with Nordic Investor Services to determine the proportion of women at middle management level, in executive positions and on the boards of listed companies. The survey for 2017 covered 305 primary and secondary listed companies on NASDAQ Stockholm. In addition, the survey records the proportion of women who have graduated from study programmes that constitute the traditional recruitment base for management groups and boards.

The figures refer to all companies listed on NASDAQ Stockholm, unless otherwise specified. 
The Second AP Fund (AP2) is one of five buffer funds within the Swedish pension system and one of the largest pension funds in northern Europe. AP2 has assets under management of SEK 324.5 billion (31 Dec 2016) in virtually every asset class and all over the world. The fund takes a long-term and responsible approach to asset management and its mandate is to maximise investment returns in the long term while keeping risk as low as possible in order not to trigger the so-called brake, or automatic balancing mechanism.

 Asset management strategy
Maximizing return on assets while maintaining a low level of risk is central to the AP funds’ mission. Investment strategy shall take into account the impact of pension disbursements and the payment reserve necessary to cover outflows from the funds. The strategic benchmark represents the mix of different assets classes that the Second AP Fund believes will generate the best long-term growth in pension values.
The Second AP Fund uses an Asset-Liability-Model (ALM), developed in-house, to forecast how the pension system is likely to develop over the long term and the extent to which the Fund’s portfolio selection is expected to affect the balancing of the national pension system. In concrete terms, this means that the Fund’s long-term investment focus is determined with a view to avoiding, as far as possible, activating the ‘brake’.

The Second AP Fund uses an Asset-Liability-Model (ALM), developed in-house, to forecast how the pension system is likely to develop over the long term.

The assumptions made concerning demographic and general economic development are thereby decisive in determining the Fund’s long-term investment focus. The performance profiles of the investment assets the Fund considers when composing its strategic benchmark are also highly significant.
The Second AP Fund’s ALM analysis reveals that a relatively high long-term return is necessary if the goals established for its asset management activities are to be attained. In practice, therefore, this means that a large part of the Fund’s capital will be invested in high-risk assets, such as equities and credit bonds. Given the present low interest rates, the return on low-risk assets – such as government securities – will not be adequate to attain the goals established for the Fund’s investment activities.
Recent years have typified the episodic progress that marks financial markets in the long term. The Second AP Fund therefore seeks to increase the dynamic element in its strategic benchmark, to adjust the level of risk adopted in relation to long-term market prospects.
Portfolio diversification is a crucial factor in composing a strategic benchmark. Nevertheless, a globalised economy and the closer integration of international financial markets make traditional diversification more problematic. New sources of return may instead be found in investment areas that lie outside traditional quoted asset classes. The Second AP Fund is engaged in an ongoing evaluation of opportunities for investing parts of the portfolio in such alternative areas.
