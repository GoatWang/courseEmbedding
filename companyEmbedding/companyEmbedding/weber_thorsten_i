FCMS GmbH in Munich, Siemens AG Austria, the Virtual Vehicle Research Center (ViF) and the Institute of Electrical Engineering (IGTE) at the Graz University of Technology spent three years researching multidisciplinary development methods for bogies. The use of new technologies now, for the first time, makes it possible to apply mathematical optimization to the bogie topology of the trains of the future.

According to the news magazine FOCUS (14/2016 edition), Deutsche Post is joining the ranks of carmakers. Following a three-year test phase, the company is now launching series production of the StreetScooter electric commercial vehicle. It is planned that 2,000 of the yellow, electrically driven vehicles roll off the production line in 2016 and over time replace up to 30,000 conventional vehicles in the delivery fleet. In the medium-term, Deutsche Post is planning on selling its electric vehicles to third parties. The body concept for the first electric commercial vehicle to go into series production was developed and validated in just three months.

ISKO engineers optimize the geometry of flow channels using the FCM tool suite

The talk given at the German NAFEMS conference in 2015 demonstrated how the FCM tool suite can be used to optimize the design of flow channels. Following the presentation of several examples of automobile component design optimizations, the flow characteristics of a channel in the front section of a vehicle were improved by optimizing the channel geometry, while still respecting the available installation space. The optimized channel is available in CATIA format for re-use by design and simulation engineers.

At the “Rad Schiene 2014″ conference in Dresden, Siemens Graz presented the advantages of parametric FCM geometry for the optimization of complex solid geometries. In Graz, Austria, Siemens develops all the bogies for high-speed trains, underground and tram cars as well as for special vehicles. They are designed to cope with highly complex loads over a service life of approximately 30 years. Optimization using the FCM tool suite has made it possible to design previously unachievable geometrical bogie variants for this type of application and consequently improve product quality.

Using the example of a project undertaken with BMW, Semcon presented the advantages of the easily modifiable, parametric geometries provided by the FCM tool suite. The talk provided a clearly illustrated description of the use of the software in a range of areas (styling and packaging, generation of geometry variants, derivation of CAE models, simulation and optimization) and compared the advantages of flexible geometries (“fast and simple”) with the conventional geometries found in CAD systems (“slow and complicated”). The presentation concluded that conventional CAD systems are not suitable for fulfilling CAE-related requirements.

BMW presented methods for vehicle concept development based on the use of the easy-to-modify geometries from the FCM tool suite. The talk focused on the use of easy-to-calculate FEM beam models for the optimization of NVH properties, the feedback of optimized models into surfaces for FEM shell simulations, the CPU time-efficient weight minimization of the steel and aluminum bodywork for the BMW 3 series, and the optimization of acoustics of the automobile interior.

The presentation illustrated beam theory on the basis of the NASTRAN-FEM Solver and explained the advantages (very fast simulation and optimization) as well as the drawbacks (abstraction) of FEM beam simulations compared to conventional FEM shell models. The FCM geometry model of a car body is available for this efficient FEM beam simulation at the touch of a button and, following optimization, can be fed back into a new surface model.
