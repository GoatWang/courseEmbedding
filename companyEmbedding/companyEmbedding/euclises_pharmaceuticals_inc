Euclises Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Receives Patent from European Patent Office for New Class of Compounds for Treatment of Cancer, Pain and Inflammation
Dec 9 15
Euclises Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has received a Notice of Allowance from the European Patent Office for Patent Application No. 12879240.5 entitled, Deuterated Benzopyran Compounds and Application Thereof. The covered compounds have been shown to be very potent and highly selective in the inhibition the COX-2 enzyme. The patent broadly covers some of the Company’s novel compounds, including its lead drug ECP-1014, which has demonstrated significant slowing of tumor growth in animal models of cancer. Euclises is currently focused n completing the IND-enabling studies in anticipation of initiating clinical trials late in 2016 in patients with colorectal cancer. COX-2 has been shown to play a critical role in tumorigenesis, progression and development of resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapies in a number of cancers, including NSCLC, CRC, pancreatic cancer, renal cell cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. While the role of COX-2 in cancer has been well known for some time, older COX-2 inhibitors have not been effectively developed for oncology treatment, in part due to side effects that limit dosing. Use of these older inhibitors in initial clinical studies has, however, firmly validated the efficacy of COX-2 inhibition in cancer and also facilitated the identification of a non-invasive biomarker that allows selection and monitoring of patients whose tumors are dependent on the COX-2 pathway. Euclises new classes of COX-2 inhibitors appear to possess the favorable characteristics of the older drugs but are expected to support clinically optimal anti-cancer dose levels safely.

Right Dose | Euclises














































 
 
 
 
 








      

 
Right Dose
Clinical studies with coxibs have shown that anti-cancer efficacy continues to increase as coxib doses rise above the approved and clinically accepted doses used for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or acute pain. These coxib doses approved for pain and inflammation are unable to achieve complete pharmacological suppression of the high levels of COX-2 activity in tumor cells and the tumor-immune microenvironment, as is necessary to afford good anti-cancer efficacy.
Euclicoxibs™ allow for safe use of the higher doses required for maximal COX-2 inhibition, biomarker suppression, and anti-cancer efficacy.

Right Drug | Euclises














































 
 
 
 
 








      

 
Right Drug
Coxibs were developed and approved for the chronic treatment of pain and inflammation.  Use of high doses of coxibs to effectively treat cancer has been limited due to potential safety issues in combination with standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapeutics and targeted therapy.  Euclicoxibs™ are designed to both increase anti-cancer potency and safely reach higher doses/exposures required for maximal anti-cancer effectiveness while mitigating side-effects with combination therapies.  Euclicoxibs™ are expected to be the right drugs to use in combination with SOC to treat refractory cancers that are driven by COX-2 and are sensitive to COX-2 inhibition.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 













About Us | Euclises














































 
 
 
 
 





About Us


Euclises Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a drug discovery and development company advancing the next generation of oral, small-molecule drugs that target COX-2 to disrupt the tumor microenvironment and kill cancer cells. Blocking this key target has been shown to (a) slow tumor growth, (b) augment the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors by eliminating COX-2/PGE-2 mediated tumor immune evasion, and (c) boost the efficacy of other targeted agents such as EGFR inhibitors by shutting down resistance pathways.
Our mission is to advance these new molecules in combinations with both immune checkpoint and EGFR inhibitors through initial clinical trials.
We believe this approach has the potential to dramatically improve the overall efficacy of current immuno-oncology therapies and EGFR inhibitors, and to expand the number of patients who benefit from these agents.
Euclises boasts a team of pharmaceutical veterans who have led development of dozens of clinical candidates and marketed drugs.
