	WESTERN GAS ANNOUNCES




	FIRST-QUARTER


	2017


	 RESULTS









	HOUSTON


	,


	May 2, 2017


	 – Western Gas Partners, LP (NYSE: WES) (“WES” or the “Partnership”) and Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (NYSE: WGP) (“WGP”) today announced


	first-quarter




	2017


	 financial and operating results.




	WESTERN GAS PARTNERS, LP






	Net income (loss) available to limited partners for the


	first quarter


	 of


	2017


	 totaled


	$5.6 million


	,


	 or


	$0.01


	 per common unit (diluted), with


	first-quarter




	2017


	 Adjusted EBITDA



	(1)



	 of


	$255.0 million


	 and


	first-quarter




	2017


	 Distributable cash flow



	(1)



	 of


	$216.5 million


	.




	WES previously declared a quarterly distribution of


	$0.875


	 per unit for the


	first quarter


	 of


	2017


	. This distribution represented a


	2%




	increase


	 over the prior quarter’s distribution and a


	7%




	increase


	 over the


	first-quarter




	2016


	 distribution of


	$0.815


	 per unit. The


	first-quarter




	2017


	 Coverage ratio



	(1)



	 of


	1.15


	 times was based on the quarterly distribution of


	$0.875


	 per unit.




	“During the quarter, we began executing the largest capital program in our history, with three Delaware Basin processing plants in various stages of development. Ramsey train VI remains on schedule to begin service in the fourth quarter of this year, and Mentone trains I and II remain on schedule for start-up in the second half of 2018,” said Chief Executive Officer, Benjamin Fink. “Furthermore, during the quarter we closed our DBJV-for-Marcellus asset exchange and successfully converted half of our outstanding convertible preferred units into common units, with the other half to be converted this month. Both of these transactions are critical steps toward achieving our objective of providing sustainable distribution growth over time.”

	This news release contains forward-looking statements. WES and WGP’s management believes that their expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. No assurance, however, can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this news release. These factors include the ability to meet financial guidance or distribution growth expectations; the ability to safely and efficiently operate WES’s assets; the supply of, demand for, and price of oil, natural gas, NGLs and related products or services; the ability to meet projected in-service dates for capital growth projects; construction costs or capital expenditures exceeding estimated or budgeted costs or expenditures; and the other factors described in the “Risk Factors” sections of WES’s and WGP’s most recent Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in their other public filings and press releases. Western Gas Partners and Western Gas Equity Partners undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.

	Western Gas Partners, LP Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures









	Below are reconciliations of (i) net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (GAAP) to WES’s Distributable cash flow (non-GAAP), (ii) net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (GAAP) and net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (“Adjusted EBITDA”) (non-GAAP), and (iii) operating income (loss) (GAAP) to Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (“Adjusted gross margin”) (non-GAAP), as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management believes that WES’s Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin, and Coverage ratio are widely accepted financial indicators of WES’s financial performance compared to other publicly traded partnerships and are useful in assessing its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin and Coverage ratio, as defined by WES, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, WES’s Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin and Coverage ratio should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP and other applicable performance measures, such as operating income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities.

	Distributable Cash Flow









	WES defines Distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA, plus interest income and the net settlement amounts from the sale and/or purchase of natural gas, condensate and NGLs under WES’s commodity price swap agreements to the extent such amounts are not recognized as Adjusted EBITDA, less net cash paid (or to be paid) for interest expense (including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs originally paid in cash, offset by non-cash capitalized interest), maintenance capital expenditures, Series A Preferred unit distributions and income taxes.

They invest primarily in midstream oil and gas pipeline companies that charge a service fee to transport energy production from production points to end users. These companies gather, transport, process, store, distribute or market natural gas, natural gas liquids, coal, crude oil, refined petroleum products or other natural resources, or explore, develop, manage or produce such commodities.Tortoise Capital serves as investment adviser to their affiliated registered closed-end funds and open-end funds, as well as a private fund. These funds invest in MLPs, pipeline and other energy companies or other companies that benefit from the operations of energy companies. Tortoise Capital's primary investment strategy is fundamentals based, long-only, with an emphasis on managing risk which they define as the potential for a permanent loss of capital.

They may employ other strategies for investment company clients involving leveraging and hedging, or writing (selling) covered call options on selected equity securities in the client’s portfolio.
