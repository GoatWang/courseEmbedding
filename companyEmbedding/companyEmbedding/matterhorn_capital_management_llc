AVALON ADVISORS ANNOUNCES SAN ANTONIO EXPANSION
Deal Enhances, Expands Capabilities
Serving Needs of San Antonio and South Texas Clients


December 21, 2016


 
Avalon Advisors, LLC (“Avalon”) and Matterhorn Capital Management, LLC (“Matterhorn”) today announced their companies have entered into an agreement which will build upon and enhance their capabilities to meet the needs of clients in San Antonio and throughout the South Texas region.  Going forward, the joint entity, with combined assets under management exceeding $6 billion, will operate as Avalon Advisors, LLC.
 
Since its inception in 2001, Avalon has served San Antonio clients from its Houston headquarters, and in 2014 the firm opened a local office to expand its central and south Texas presence significantly under the leadership of San Antonio native Rob McClane.
 
A San Antonio-based and independently owned investment management firm, Matterhorn, was founded in 2005 to manage equity and fixed income portfolios for high net worth individuals, family offices, regional advisory groups and institutional investors throughout South Texas.
 
“We have long admired Matterhorn’s stewardship approach and investment performance for the families they serve.  They bring an invaluable group of people, a strong culture, consistent performance and a pursuit of excellence that aligns naturally with Avalon and the families we will now serve together,” said Henry J. Lartigue, Avalon’s CEO and CIO. “Such a significant partnership builds on our long standing relationships with leading San Antonio and South Texas families and enhances both our portfolio management and wealth advisory capabilities.  Both firms have earned a sterling reputation for transparency, innovation, wealth preservation and fiduciary responsibility; and we will remain steadfastly committed to carrying these values forward."
 
“We look forward to joining the Avalon team and having our clients benefit from the expansion of overall resources and capabilities,” said Juan Landa, Matterhorn’s CEO. “The fact that we are committed to maintaining the continuity of our advisory teams means the investment management philosophy our clients have come to know and trust will not only be preserved but enriched.”
 
Avalon Advisors’ San Antonio office in McCombs Plaza, convenient to many of the firm’s existing clients, is expanding to accommodate the additions to the Avalon team.

The sixth-largest Houston-area wealth management firm, Avalon Advisors LLC, acquired San Antonio investment firm Matterhorn Capital Management LLC in a deal that closed this week.
The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Matterhorn Capital Management was once a startup co-founded by Juan Landa and Stefan Grater in 2005. Now both are joining Avalon Advisors' San Antonio office.
"It was a belief that we could do something different and add a higher level of sophistication to portfolio management than what we felt was offered at that time," Landa said about the company's roots.
So what inspired the sale more than a decade later?




"It was about greater resources, products and strategies for our clients," he said.
Harry Flavin was hired at Matterhorn in 2012. Matterhorn Capital is bringing the entire local team, including its equity analyst Jonathan Lewis and the company's chief compliance officer Lindsay Bagby to work for Avalon. In January 2016, a former principal at Matterhorn, Charles Hall, left the company to join Clear Rock Advisors LLC in Austin, according to his LinkedIn profile. Hall took with him about $200 million of assets under management stemming from his clients, since U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions documents show that the firm had $420 million in assets before his departure.
Matterhorn Capital Management, which focused on equity and fixed income investments, had increased its assets under management from about $150 million in 2011 to $220 million in 2016.
Avalon Advisors had about $5.5 billion in assets under management when it opened an office in the Alamo City in 2014. The firm will have more than $6 billion under management after the Matterhorn acquisition. Most of the clients are high-net worth families, individuals and endowments. The company has about 60 employees split between its Houston and San Antonio offices.




 


"We knew some of the families that they worked with and how they were respected, and I think vice versa. It just became a natural conversation," said Rob McClane, managing director and client adviser at Avalon Advisors. "We manage the money internally versus outsourcing that to other investment managers."

McClane is the lead for the San Antonio office at McCombs Plaza near the intersection of Mulberry Avenue and Highway 281. The company is leasing about 6,000 square feet of office there. Avalon was founded in 2001, and the wealth management advisers said the investment strategy and client relationships were similar at both firms.
Meanwhile, four private families and employees recently bought a minority interest in its firm, previously held by select outside investors including The Carlyle Group. When the deal closes this month, the majority interest in the firm will be owned by its employees and local families.
"Our desire, both for our clients and employees, is to provide for the long term independence of our firm," Henry Lartigue, founding partner, CEO and chief investment officer at Avalon, said in a press release. “Through this transaction we allow Avalon to exist as an employee owned private firm for many years.”
Avalon ranks No. 6 on the Houston Business Journal's Largest Houston-Area Money Management Firms List, based on its $4.32 billion in locally managed assets last year.

AVALON ADVISORS ANNOUNCES SAN ANTONIO EXPANSION
Deal Enhances, Expands Capabilities
Serving Needs of San Antonio and South Texas Clients


December 21, 2016


 
Avalon Advisors, LLC (“Avalon”) and Matterhorn Capital Management, LLC (“Matterhorn”) today announced their companies have entered into an agreement which will build upon and enhance their capabilities to meet the needs of clients in San Antonio and throughout the South Texas region.  Going forward, the joint entity, with combined assets under management exceeding $6 billion, will operate as Avalon Advisors, LLC.
 
Since its inception in 2001, Avalon has served San Antonio clients from its Houston headquarters, and in 2014 the firm opened a local office to expand its central and south Texas presence significantly under the leadership of San Antonio native Rob McClane.
 
A San Antonio-based and independently owned investment management firm, Matterhorn, was founded in 2005 to manage equity and fixed income portfolios for high net worth individuals, family offices, regional advisory groups and institutional investors throughout South Texas.
 
“We have long admired Matterhorn’s stewardship approach and investment performance for the families they serve.  They bring an invaluable group of people, a strong culture, consistent performance and a pursuit of excellence that aligns naturally with Avalon and the families we will now serve together,” said Henry J. Lartigue, Avalon’s CEO and CIO. “Such a significant partnership builds on our long standing relationships with leading San Antonio and South Texas families and enhances both our portfolio management and wealth advisory capabilities.  Both firms have earned a sterling reputation for transparency, innovation, wealth preservation and fiduciary responsibility; and we will remain steadfastly committed to carrying these values forward."
 
“We look forward to joining the Avalon team and having our clients benefit from the expansion of overall resources and capabilities,” said Juan Landa, Matterhorn’s CEO. “The fact that we are committed to maintaining the continuity of our advisory teams means the investment management philosophy our clients have come to know and trust will not only be preserved but enriched.”
 
Avalon Advisors’ San Antonio office in McCombs Plaza, convenient to many of the firm’s existing clients, is expanding to accommodate the additions to the Avalon team.
 
ABOUT AVALON ADVISORS, LLC
 
Avalon is a Houston-based independent registered investment adviser offering investment management and financial advice for individuals, families and institutions.
