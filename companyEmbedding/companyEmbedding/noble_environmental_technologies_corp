What is ECOR?
 





ECOR FACTORIES PROVIDE
A Turn-Key to Engage in the Circular Economy For Global, SME, Government & Waste Management OrganizationsThe circular economy is disrupting the way we produce and consume products, yet major brands are still losing out on $11.4B/year in recycling revenues. ECOR provides the only enterprise-grade solution to immediately access substantial recycling revenues from fiber waste and engage in all phases of this new economy.
Global brands have begun integrating ECOR into their supply chain as an advanced alternative to wood, particleboard, foam and cardboard for many applications including: green building materials, interior design, cabinetry, furniture, fixtures, home goods, packaging, printed graphics and signs. We look forward to working with these partners to convert their own waste into the ECOR they use.
 


The current ECOR manufacturing facility converts 1,250 tons/year and there are 3 large facilities planned for the BeNeLux region, which will collectively convert a total of 37,500 tons/year. The environmental impact of these 4 facilities will save ~629,000 trees and ~112,500 cubic yards of landfill space per year.

Noble Environmental Technologies Corporation










Noble Environmental Technologies Corporation (NET), is an early‐stage market disruptive and innovative technology company founded to commercialize ECOR®‐branded products and processes. ECOR® is an environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional wood, fiberboard and other composite panel products. ECOR® uses a variety of sustainable 100% recycled post‐industrial, post‐consumer and agricultural by‐products and requires no adhesives in the wet forming process. The resulting product is an extremely strong, remarkably lightweight, non‐toxic and versatile material with significant profit potential along with a host of positive economic, social and environmental implications.
Visit their website.
Project Executive Summary
Noble Environmental Technologies (NET) has developed a patented composite process to convert waste fibers into ECOR® materials which are highly versatile, durable and capable of being shaped and molded to any specification.The ECOR® brand is 100% recycled, non-toxic and four times stronger than traditional fiberboard while weighing 75% less.
NET is interested in developing ways for rapid growth to introduce this revolutionary technology into the market while providing a strong return to investors.
To assist NET in analyzing the feasibility of the licensing model, Team ECORp used the San Diego manufacturing plant as the beta test case to determine valuation. We utilized projected sales and costs to determine the expected NPV, IRR, Profitability Index, Gross Operations Margin, Terminal Value, and Payback ratios as a baseline. Should demand and sales meet expectations, NET has a very strong financial argument to manufacturers for a licensing model. This was reflected with an NPV in excess of $5.5 million and payback period of less than two years.
We then created several scenarios to determine the effect they would have on the financial projections. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that raw material price fluctuations do not have much effect on the overall value while demand, price discounting and product types have a major influence. We find that value per square foot of WaveCor™ in each product is a driving force affecting financial results.
Sustainable Brands Sustainable Brands is a learning, collaboration, and commerce community of forward-thinking sustainability, brand, and design professionals who are working to leverage sustainability as a driver of business and brand value. We recognizing that brands today have a unique role to play in focusing corporate energy and also influencing culture. Sustainable Brands serves as the bridge that accelerates the successful shift towards a future of better brands and a sustainable economy.

To stay fresh in the minds of prospective clients, imprint your company's slogan or contact information on your closeout products. Once you're ready to purchase, simply choose your desired quantity and await your game-changing shipment.
