                                I want to validate my alert. (It was me.)
                            





                                Each alert or notification guides you on what actions you need to take. For some alerts,
                                you may be asked to log in and click a button indicating that the activity is or isn’t
                                legitimate.
                            

                                Keep in mind that certain activities may trigger more than one similar looking alert,
                                especially if an activity is reported to more than one credit bureau, and that you may
                                receive an alert for up to 30 days after the activity in question.
                            

                                Sometimes our members initially dispute an alert, but on further consideration realize
                                that the alert was in fact valid. If this occurs you can respond to the investigation
                                email we send you, submit a support request or call us at 1-800-LifeLock (1-800-543-3562)
                                to let us know it was valid and we will stop investigation.
                            








                                I want to dispute an alert. (It wasn’t me.)
                            





                                We encourage you to view your alert details by visiting your LifeLock account online at
                                LifeLock.com/login. After you
                                review your alert, if you’re unsure or think the activity
                                may be fraudulent, call us at 1-800-LifeLock (1-800-543-3562) so we can give you a hand
                                sorting it out. For certain kinds of alerts, you may also be prompted to click “No, this
                                wasn’t me” within the app or your online account.
                            

                                Here are some examples of behavior that could trigger an alert up to 30 days later:
                            


                                    Applying for credit, services, or refinancing with the company or bank listed in
                                    your alert.
                                

                                    Making changes to an existing account, or being added as an authorized user on any
                                    account with the company or bank listed in your alert.
                                

                                    Applying for or inquiring about new services, store rewards cards, airline rewards
                                    programs or sweepstakes/drawings with the company or bank listed in your alert.
                                









                                I applied for credit, but have not received an alert.
                            





                                Although we have a large number of companies in our network, keep in mind the
                                network does not cover all transactions, not all merchants participate and on
                                occasion an application may be submitted by a lender or service provider that
                                does not fall within our network. In limited circumstances, it‘s also possible
                                that an application made within our network may not result in an alert or may
                                result in a delayed alert notification.
                            

                                We are constantly working to expand the reach of our network and improve
                                coverage to our members. Of course, even if you did not receive an alert from us
                                regarding fraudulent activity, as a LifeLock member you also have the benefit of
                                our $1 Million Service Guarantee‡, which means if you become a victim of
                                identity theft, if needed we will spend up to $1 million to hire experts to help
                                your recovery, and our Restoration department will work to restore your good
                                name.
                            

                                ‡ Service Guarantee benefits for State of New York members are provided under a Master
                                Insurance Policy issued by State National Insurance Company. Benefits for all other

                                How can I sign up for or opt out of LifeLock Text Message Alerts?
                            





                                Sign up for text message alerts by clicking 
                                Communications Preferences in your online account and checking the “Text Message
                                Alerts” box.
                            

                                After that, you’ll receive a confirmation text message. Reply “Start” to that message to
                                activate text alerts.
                            

                                To opt out, just uncheck the same box. You might get one more message confirming your
                                opt out after you do that.
                            








                                I still haven’t received an opt-in text for text message alerts.
                            





                                You can resend the text by visiting 
                                communication preferences in your online account. If after that you still don’t
                                receive an opt-in text, try these steps:
                            


                                    Make sure the SMS communication opt-in checkbox is enabled or checked. Double check
                                    that your mobile device telephone number listed is correct.
                                


                                        Ensure that your cell phone carrier is supported.
                                    


                                    If your carrier is supported, text "START" to 432578.
                                

                                    If you still do not receive your opt-in text, contact your carrier to ensure that no
                                    block exists on the phone number. You should ask your carrier the following
                                    questions:

                                    
"Does my plan have the ability to send and receive SMS messages from a
                                            standard rate short code of 432578?"
                                        
"If I text help to 432578 (a standard rate short code) I don’t get a
                                            response. Why not?"
                                        
"Does my plan have any purchase blocking enabled? If so, can you enable
                                            purchasing?"
                                        




                                If after this, you still haven’t received an opt-in text, call us at 1-800-LifeLock
                                (1-800-543-3562) so we can look into it.
                            








                                Which cell phone carriers does LifeLock support for Text Message Alerts?
                            





                                Our text message alerts work on most major cell phone carriers (see below). If your
                                phone is able to receive SMS text messages, you should be able to receive text message
                                alerts from LifeLock. If you are unsure, check with your cell phone carrier.

                                Will I be charged to receive alerts by text message?
                            





                                We won’t charge you for the text message alerts we send to you. We can’t speak for your
                                mobile carrier though, which may charge you depending on your plan. If you’re unsure, it
                                may be a good idea to check with them. Depending on your mobile plan and text message
                                program you may incur data charges for sending or receiving text messages.

                                I am not receiving emails from LifeLock.

                                My information has been compromised and I am a LifeLock member:
                            





                                My credit card or debit card was used fraudulently
                            

                                If you have not already done so, please contact your financial institution immediately
                                to report the fraudulent transactions so they may begin an investigation in regards to
                                your account. Once this has been reported, please call our Member Services Department at
                                1-800-LifeLock (1-800-543-3562). We need to speak with you regarding this matter and
                                collect additional information.
                            

                                I was informed of a breach of my information (no known fraudulent activity)
                            

                                There are several things you can do to watch for fraud at this time:
                            


                                    Monitor your transactions: Keep an eye on the activity on your credit and debit
                                    cards, looking out for any charges that don't seem to be yours.
                                

                                    Report suspicious transactions immediately: If you see something that doesn't look
                                    right, contact the card issuer immediately. The phone number is on the back of your
                                    card. If the transactions turn out to be fraudulent, you will also want to notify
                                    LifeLock. The LifeLock Service Terms and Conditions require that you notify LifeLock
                                    within ninety (90) days of the date you know, or reasonably should have known, that
                                    someone has improperly used your credit/debit cards or bank account.
                                

                                    Watch your credit reports: You can get a free credit report from each of the three
                                    major U.S. credit bureaus each year, and you can pay for more frequent access. Get
                                    more information from the Federal Trade Commission at

                                    Act fast: If you believe you're the victim of identity theft, there are several
                                    immediate steps you should take. If you're a LifeLock member and think you've been a
                                    victim, call our Member Services team for assistance at 1-800-LifeLock
                                    (1-800-543-3562).
                                


                                One other suggestion is to have fraud alerts placed on your credit file as an added
                                precaution during this time. If you would like to call and set the fraud alerts on your
                                own, please call one of the credit bureaus numbers listed below. Once fraud alerts are
                                placed with one bureau, they will notify the other two.

                                If you believe you’ve been a victim of identity theft, our Member Services team is
                                available at 1-800-LifeLock (1-800-543-3562) to assist at your convenience.
                            








                                I received a suspicious phone call, email or mail.
                            





                                Phone Call
                            

                                It is important to note that phone calls, like the one you received, can be phishing
                                schemes that criminals use to try to get your information. Unfortunately, LifeLock is
                                unable to assist with or investigate unwanted or suspicious phone calls such as these.
                                We recommend that you never give any personal or bank information over the phone unless
                                you are certain of the caller. You may want to contact your telephone service provider
                                to see if it is possible to block calls from this number.
                            

                                You may also contact your state Attorney General to file a consumer complaint regarding
                                these phone calls, as well as filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. To
                                learn more about telephone fraud and report telephone fraud please go to www.ftc.gov/phonefraud.
                            

                                Another suggestion is to register your phone number on the national Do Not Call Registry
                                at www.DoNotCall.gov, or by calling
                                1-888-382-1222 (TTY: 1-866-290-4236) from the number you wish to register. If you
                                register online, you must click on the confirmation email you receive to complete your
                                free registration.
                            

                                Email
                            

                                Emails like the one you received may be phishing schemes that criminals use to try to
                                get your information. You should delete that email, do not reply or click any of the
                                links. Never give any personal or bank information over the Internet unless you are
                                certain of the sender.
                            

                                If you suspect you have been a victim of Internet Fraud, you can file a complaint with
                                the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) which is a partnership between the Federal
                                Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C) and the
                                Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). IC3 accepts online Internet crime complaints from
                                either the person who believes they were defrauded or from a third party to the
                                complaint.
                            

                                Please visit www.ic3.gov for additional information.
                            

                                Mail
                            

                                Unfortunately, this is fairly common and does not necessarily mean that an identity
                                theft has occurred. LifeLock will be unable to stop or investigate this type of unwanted
                                mail. One suggestion is to mark the mail with "Return to Sender—Not at This Address" and
                                put it back into the mail. If you continue to receive mail that is not yours, please
                                notify the post office. If you are also receiving unwanted junk mail, you can opt out of
                                this online by visiting  www.dmachoice.org  and
                                filling out their online form.
                            

                                As always, watch your accounts carefully. If you notice any unauthorized activity on any
                                of your personal accounts, please notify LifeLock and the financial
                                institution/organization in question as soon as possible.
                            








                                How do I add a member?
                            





                                You can add additional members to your account online by clicking Manage Account.
                            

                                Scroll down until you see the button that says Add Member toward the right-hand side of
                                the screen. Then just enter the information requested.
                            

                                In rare cases, certain types of memberships cannot support adding members this way and
                                require a call to Member Services at 1-800-LifeLock (1-800-543-3562).
                            

                                Everyone has a different social security number, so we have to charge per person, per
                                membership, as this allows for each individual to receive our $1 Million Service
                                Guarantee. ‡ That means if you become a victim of identity theft while a LifeLock member
                                we will spend up to one million dollars to hire experts to help your recovery.
                            

                                ‡ Service Guarantee benefits for State of New York members are provided under a Master
                                Insurance Policy issued by State National Insurance Company. Benefits for all other

                                Insurance Company. Under the Service Guarantee LifeLock will spend up to $1 million to

                                Why can’t I access details of my household members’ accounts online?
                            





                                For security reasons, you will be unable to view or update the accounts for your whole
                                household through your own account. Each account holder needs to sign into their own
                                account in order to view or update their information.

                            

                                The reason we require separate online accounts for each adult member is because of the
                                sensitive personal information included on each member's account. We know it is
                                important to you to keep your personal information safe and so we share your personal
                                information only in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
                            

                                If anyone in your household has forgotten their username or password they can click Forgot User ID/Password
                                 and follow the instructions.
                            








                                Do you cover business entities or accounts?
                            





                                LifeLock does not cover businesses entities. Our technology and service is designed to
                                help protect individuals with social security numbers and other personal identifiable
                                information, which businesses don’t have.
                            












                                How do I update the credit card that I use to pay my LifeLock bill?
                            





                                You can update your credit card by clicking Billing Information.
                            

                                For security reasons, you’ll need to reenter the credit card number even if you are only
                                updating the expiration date.
                            








                                How do I check my LifeLock billing details?
                            





                                You can view your billing date and history by clicking Billing Information.
                            








                                How can I change my plan ?
                            





                                You can easily upgrade your account by clicking 
                                Manage Account and going to Upgrade Plan.
                            

                                If you would like to downgrade your plan, you can call us at 1-800-LifeLock
                                (1-800-543-3562), or by clicking 
                                Request Support and letting us know which plan you would like to switch to.
                            








                                How do I cancel my LifeLock account?
                            





                                We’ll be sorry to see you go! You can cancel over the phone at 1-800-LifeLock
                                (1-800-543-3562), or by clicking Request Support and
                                choosing that option.
                            












                                Where do I locate my credit reports and scores?
                            





                                You can find your information by clicking Credit Score & Report on the
                                left-hand side of the screen. Use the tabs at the top to view the different sections of
                                your credit report. You can scroll down in the Overview tab to download your credit
                                report.
                            

                                Only members on LifeLock Advantage, Ultimate, and Ultimate Plus plans who have passed
                                the appropriate authentication tests have access to these features—but if you’re a
                                LifeLock Standard member and would like to gain access, we’d be glad to help you change
                                plan tiers! Give us a call at 1-800-LifeLock (1-800-543-3562).
                            








                                Why is my LifeLock credit score different than what I've seen elsewhere?
                            





                                Some people are surprised to learn that there is no universal credit score; instead
                                there are many companies that apply many models—all based on your credit report data.
                                Each takes a slightly different approach to calculating a score. LifeLock uses the
                                VantageScore 3.0 ® model, which uses the same 300 to 850 range as the most familiar
                                scoring model, FICO, but may produce a slightly different number.
                            


                                    The credit score is intended for your own educational use. It is also commercially
                                    available to third parties along with numerous other credit scores and models in the
                                    marketplace. Please keep in mind third parties are likely to use a different score
                                    when evaluating your creditworthiness. Also, third parties will take into
                                    consideration items other than your credit score or information found in your credit
                                    file, such as your income.
                                









                                Who's who in credit?
                            





                                There are a variety of organizations involved in helping to assess your likelihood of
                                paying back money you’ve borrowed. To better understand credit, you need to begin by
                                understanding the various organizations and processes involved in determining whether to
                                offer you credit, and at what terms.
                                Here are the terms to know:
                            

                                What are Lenders?
                            

Lenders determine your creditworthiness by evaluating the information
                                on your credit profile. They also regularly contribute information about your loans—the
                                amount borrowed, whether you’ve made timely payments, and so on—to the three national
                                credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.
                            

                                What are Credit Bureaus?
                            

                                The credit bureaus collect information from lenders and other data
                                sources, create a comprehensive credit report, and provide this data to potential
                                lenders and others that might need to assess your creditworthiness, such as landlords.
                            

                                What are Credit Reports?
                            

Credit reports, also known as credit files, are composed of the data a
                                credit bureau has gathered about you from lenders and other sources. Credit reports
                                include records of mortgage payments, credit card balances and payments, auto loan
                                payments and credit inquiries. It may also include public records, such as tax liens and
                                other information from government sources.
                            

                                What is a Credit Scoring Model?
                            

Credit scoring models are developed to provide a numerical
                                interpretation of the information in your credit report that has been tested to be
                                predictive. This gives lenders a statistical measurement of how likely you are to pay
                                back a loan. Some people are surprised to learn that there is no universal credit score;
                                instead there are many companies that apply many models—all based on your credit report
                                data. LifeLock uses a scoring model called VantageScore 3.0 ®, which uses the familiar
                                300-850 range. It's entirely healthy and routine for your credit scores to change
                                slightly, but generally a good idea to keep track of your score so you can notice any
                                dramatic shifts.
                            

                                Many people confuse credit reports with credit scores, but the two are quite different.
                                Understanding that difference can help you to figure out why you have a particular
                                score.
                            


                                    The credit score is intended for your own educational use. It is also commercially
                                    available to third parties along with numerous other credit scores and models in the
                                    marketplace. Please keep in mind third parties are likely to use a different score
                                    when evaluating your creditworthiness. Also, third parties will take into
                                    consideration items other than your credit score or information found in your credit
                                    file, such as your income.
                                









                                How is credit scored?
                            





                                A credit score is a three-digit number that results from a mathematical formula being
                                applied to your credit report. Credit scores may differ from one source to the next
                                because different lenders use different credit scoring models. And since a score is
                                based on frequently updated credit files, it may vary over time. It's entirely healthy
                                and routine for your credit scores to change slightly, but generally a good idea to keep
                                track of your score so you can notice any dramatic changes.
                            


                                    The credit score is intended for your own educational use. It is also commercially
                                    available to third parties along with numerous other credit scores and models in the
                                    marketplace. Please keep in mind third parties are likely to use a different score
                                    when evaluating your creditworthiness. Also, third parties will take into
                                    consideration items other than your credit score or information found in your credit
                                    file, such as your income.
                                









                                Why are there differences between my scores from each bureau?
                            





                                Because your scores are calculated using the information in your credit files, which may
                                differ across the three bureaus, there may be differences between the scores each bureau
                                provides. That's why it's important to periodically review your reports and scores from
                                all three agencies.

                                What should I do if there is an error on my credit report?
                            





                                If you believe the error is the result of fraud, or you just aren’t sure, contact us at
                                1-800-LifeLock (1-800-543-3562) immediately. If you think it was just a mistake, please
                                contact the creditor and the credit bureau directly to follow their dispute process.
                                It’s generally easier to file a dispute online. The three credit bureaus are:

                                Is LifeLock a credit monitoring service?
                            





                                Our LifeLock Ultimate Plus plan includes credit monitoring, but LifeLock is much more
                                than just credit monitoring alone. With credit monitoring you are only notified of
                                changes to your credit file, such as new loan applications, after they are reported to
                                the credit bureaus. The LifeLock alert network includes a variety of product features
                                and data sources and serves as a proactive link between consumers, lenders and
                                merchants. Although it is very extensive, our network does not cover all transactions at
                                all businesses, so you might not receive a LifeLock alert in every single case.
                            








                                Is LifeLock a credit repair organization?
                            





                                We want to be very clear that LifeLock is not a credit repair business. We’ll help
                                proactively safeguard your credit and finances, and if you become a victim of identity
                                theft while a LifeLock member, we’ll work to help you fix it—we’ll even spend up to $1
                                million on lawyers and experts if needed‡—but we don’t promise to repair your bad
                                credit, because that’s something we just can’t do.
                            

                                ‡ Service Guarantee benefits for State of New York members are provided under a Master
                                Insurance Policy issued by State National Insurance Company. Benefits for all other

                                    At least one capital letter

                                    At least one number between 1 and 9

                                


                                While we don’t require a special character, we recommend including at least one.

                                    Ensure you haven’t marked emails from LifeLock as spam or junk (adding LifeLock to
                                    your contacts might help)

            Company Overview
        





Leaders in the fight against identity theft

            LifeLock is a modern identity theft protection company. And with the flood of mobile technology and

History[edit]
LifeLock was co-founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis. Amid controversy, Maynard left the company in 2007.[5][6]
In December 2008, LifeLock entered into an agreement with TransUnion, one of the three main credit bureaus, to automate the process of alerting customers of potential unauthorized access via their credit reports.[7] LifeLock acquired ID Analytics following a round of funding in March 2012.[8] ID Analytics operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8]
Following the announcement of the company's IPO in August 2012, Hilary Schneider joined the company as president.[9] Schneider had previously been working with TPG Capital after leaving Yahoo in 2010.[9]
In December 2013, LifeLock acquired Lemon Wallet for $42.6 million.[10][11] Lemon is a digital wallet platform which stores payment, loyalty, and identification cards on members' smartphones.[12] Lemon Wallet Plus was a premium service which offered lost wallet service, account monitoring, and some security measures. Wallet Plus has been folded into a new service offered by LifeLock which includes identity fraud alerts.[12] The company temporarily removed the app from mobile stores in May 2014 when the company learned that certain parts of the app were not in compliance with payment industry standards.[13]
As of February 2014, LifeLock had 3 million subscribers.[14]
In July 2015, CNN reported that FTC and 35 United State Attorneys General deemed LifeLock in violation of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[15] In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion.[16]
ID Analytics, Inc.[edit]
In March 2012, ID Analytics, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8] ID Analytics was founded in 2002.[17] It provides consumer risk management with real-time consumer behavior insights and in-depth visibility into identity risk and creditworthiness.[18] Both government agencies and U.S. companies utilize ID Analytics for risk based decision making on revenue enhancement, fraud reduction, cost saving drivers and customer protection.[17]
Funding[edit]
The company started with $2 million in seed funding, with another $5 million in its Series A funding in 2006 from Bessemer Ventures.[19][20]
In April 2007, LifeLock raised $6 million in its series B funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[19] The following January, its Series C Funding ended with $25 million, led by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[21] In August 2009, a series D funding round raised $40 million for the company.[22] LifeLock raised $100 million in new equity funding from Bessemer Ventures Partners, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Symantec Corporation and River Street Management in March 2012.[23] The funds were used towards the acquisition of ID Analytics, an identity theft risk prediction technology.[8]
On August 28, 2012, LifeLock announced its plans to take its identity theft protection business public and filed for an initial public offering worth up to $175 million.[24] On October 3, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol LOCK, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[25]
Product[edit]
LifeLock offers Standard, Advantage, Ultimate Plus and Junior monitoring services. LifeLock Standard offers identity theft detection and alerts within its network, lost wallet protection, address change verification, black market website surveillance and reduced pre-approved credit card offers.[26] LifeLock Advantage contains everything in the Standard plan plus fictitious identity monitoring, court record scanning, and an online annual credit score and report and credit monitoring alerts through Equifax. LifeLock Ultimate Plus includes bank account takeover alerts within its network, enhanced credit application alerts and online credit reports and scores on top of the Standard and Advantage features.[27][28] Its Junior protection provides identity theft detection and alerts, credit file verification, black market website surveillance and file sharing network searches.[29]
LifeLock provides a $1 million guarantee in the event of identity theft.[30] The guarantee is that LifeLock will spend up to $1,000,000 on legal and associated fees necessary in restoring a customer's identity. The guarantee does not cover the direct losses such a customer incurs from identity theft or pay restitution to them for money lost.[30][31]
Marketing[edit]
LifeLock has partnered with major banks, national corporations and has celebrity endorsers.[32] In addition to sponsoring NPR programming,[citation needed] LifeLock advertises heavily on the Internet and radio; its ads can be heard on the radio shows of Paul Harvey, Rush Limbaugh, Adam Carolla, Kim Komando, and Charles Osgood.[33] Celebrity spokespersons for LifeLock have included Howard Stern, Paul Harvey, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.[34]
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]
LifeLock's advertising agency of record is Lowe Campbell Ewald.[43][44] In January 2014, LifeLock announced a new television commercial, called "Do Your Thing", and a redesigned company logo.[45]
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Starting in 2010, LifeLock has partnered with the FBI-LEEDA (Law Enforcement Executive Development Association) to provide educational seminars to law enforcement officials on identity theft.[46] The seminars occur multiple times a year in various regions throughout the United States. In February 2014, the company partnered with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with the goals of helping kids learn safe online habits.[47]
In April 2014, the company entered into partnership with Vivint to offer home and identity protection together.[48]
Controversies[edit]
Robert J. Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

History[edit]
LifeLock was co-founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis. Amid controversy, Maynard left the company in 2007.[5][6]
In December 2008, LifeLock entered into an agreement with TransUnion, one of the three main credit bureaus, to automate the process of alerting customers of potential unauthorized access via their credit reports.[7] LifeLock acquired ID Analytics following a round of funding in March 2012.[8] ID Analytics operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8]
Following the announcement of the company's IPO in August 2012, Hilary Schneider joined the company as president.[9] Schneider had previously been working with TPG Capital after leaving Yahoo in 2010.[9]
In December 2013, LifeLock acquired Lemon Wallet for $42.6 million.[10][11] Lemon is a digital wallet platform which stores payment, loyalty, and identification cards on members' smartphones.[12] Lemon Wallet Plus was a premium service which offered lost wallet service, account monitoring, and some security measures. Wallet Plus has been folded into a new service offered by LifeLock which includes identity fraud alerts.[12] The company temporarily removed the app from mobile stores in May 2014 when the company learned that certain parts of the app were not in compliance with payment industry standards.[13]
As of February 2014, LifeLock had 3 million subscribers.[14]
In July 2015, CNN reported that FTC and 35 United State Attorneys General deemed LifeLock in violation of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[15] In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion.[16]
ID Analytics, Inc.[edit]
In March 2012, ID Analytics, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8] ID Analytics was founded in 2002.[17] It provides consumer risk management with real-time consumer behavior insights and in-depth visibility into identity risk and creditworthiness.[18] Both government agencies and U.S. companies utilize ID Analytics for risk based decision making on revenue enhancement, fraud reduction, cost saving drivers and customer protection.[17]
Funding[edit]
The company started with $2 million in seed funding, with another $5 million in its Series A funding in 2006 from Bessemer Ventures.[19][20]
In April 2007, LifeLock raised $6 million in its series B funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[19] The following January, its Series C Funding ended with $25 million, led by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[21] In August 2009, a series D funding round raised $40 million for the company.[22] LifeLock raised $100 million in new equity funding from Bessemer Ventures Partners, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Symantec Corporation and River Street Management in March 2012.[23] The funds were used towards the acquisition of ID Analytics, an identity theft risk prediction technology.[8]
On August 28, 2012, LifeLock announced its plans to take its identity theft protection business public and filed for an initial public offering worth up to $175 million.[24] On October 3, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol LOCK, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[25]
Product[edit]
LifeLock offers Standard, Advantage, Ultimate Plus and Junior monitoring services. LifeLock Standard offers identity theft detection and alerts within its network, lost wallet protection, address change verification, black market website surveillance and reduced pre-approved credit card offers.[26] LifeLock Advantage contains everything in the Standard plan plus fictitious identity monitoring, court record scanning, and an online annual credit score and report and credit monitoring alerts through Equifax. LifeLock Ultimate Plus includes bank account takeover alerts within its network, enhanced credit application alerts and online credit reports and scores on top of the Standard and Advantage features.[27][28] Its Junior protection provides identity theft detection and alerts, credit file verification, black market website surveillance and file sharing network searches.[29]
LifeLock provides a $1 million guarantee in the event of identity theft.[30] The guarantee is that LifeLock will spend up to $1,000,000 on legal and associated fees necessary in restoring a customer's identity. The guarantee does not cover the direct losses such a customer incurs from identity theft or pay restitution to them for money lost.[30][31]
Marketing[edit]
LifeLock has partnered with major banks, national corporations and has celebrity endorsers.[32] In addition to sponsoring NPR programming,[citation needed] LifeLock advertises heavily on the Internet and radio; its ads can be heard on the radio shows of Paul Harvey, Rush Limbaugh, Adam Carolla, Kim Komando, and Charles Osgood.[33] Celebrity spokespersons for LifeLock have included Howard Stern, Paul Harvey, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.[34]
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]
LifeLock's advertising agency of record is Lowe Campbell Ewald.[43][44] In January 2014, LifeLock announced a new television commercial, called "Do Your Thing", and a redesigned company logo.[45]
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Starting in 2010, LifeLock has partnered with the FBI-LEEDA (Law Enforcement Executive Development Association) to provide educational seminars to law enforcement officials on identity theft.[46] The seminars occur multiple times a year in various regions throughout the United States. In February 2014, the company partnered with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with the goals of helping kids learn safe online habits.[47]
In April 2014, the company entered into partnership with Vivint to offer home and identity protection together.[48]

History[edit]
LifeLock was co-founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis. Amid controversy, Maynard left the company in 2007.[5][6]
In December 2008, LifeLock entered into an agreement with TransUnion, one of the three main credit bureaus, to automate the process of alerting customers of potential unauthorized access via their credit reports.[7] LifeLock acquired ID Analytics following a round of funding in March 2012.[8] ID Analytics operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8]
Following the announcement of the company's IPO in August 2012, Hilary Schneider joined the company as president.[9] Schneider had previously been working with TPG Capital after leaving Yahoo in 2010.[9]
In December 2013, LifeLock acquired Lemon Wallet for $42.6 million.[10][11] Lemon is a digital wallet platform which stores payment, loyalty, and identification cards on members' smartphones.[12] Lemon Wallet Plus was a premium service which offered lost wallet service, account monitoring, and some security measures. Wallet Plus has been folded into a new service offered by LifeLock which includes identity fraud alerts.[12] The company temporarily removed the app from mobile stores in May 2014 when the company learned that certain parts of the app were not in compliance with payment industry standards.[13]
As of February 2014, LifeLock had 3 million subscribers.[14]
In July 2015, CNN reported that FTC and 35 United State Attorneys General deemed LifeLock in violation of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[15] In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion.[16]
ID Analytics, Inc.[edit]
In March 2012, ID Analytics, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8] ID Analytics was founded in 2002.[17] It provides consumer risk management with real-time consumer behavior insights and in-depth visibility into identity risk and creditworthiness.[18] Both government agencies and U.S. companies utilize ID Analytics for risk based decision making on revenue enhancement, fraud reduction, cost saving drivers and customer protection.[17]
Funding[edit]
The company started with $2 million in seed funding, with another $5 million in its Series A funding in 2006 from Bessemer Ventures.[19][20]
In April 2007, LifeLock raised $6 million in its series B funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[19] The following January, its Series C Funding ended with $25 million, led by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[21] In August 2009, a series D funding round raised $40 million for the company.[22] LifeLock raised $100 million in new equity funding from Bessemer Ventures Partners, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Symantec Corporation and River Street Management in March 2012.[23] The funds were used towards the acquisition of ID Analytics, an identity theft risk prediction technology.[8]
On August 28, 2012, LifeLock announced its plans to take its identity theft protection business public and filed for an initial public offering worth up to $175 million.[24] On October 3, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol LOCK, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[25]
Product[edit]
LifeLock offers Standard, Advantage, Ultimate Plus and Junior monitoring services. LifeLock Standard offers identity theft detection and alerts within its network, lost wallet protection, address change verification, black market website surveillance and reduced pre-approved credit card offers.[26] LifeLock Advantage contains everything in the Standard plan plus fictitious identity monitoring, court record scanning, and an online annual credit score and report and credit monitoring alerts through Equifax. LifeLock Ultimate Plus includes bank account takeover alerts within its network, enhanced credit application alerts and online credit reports and scores on top of the Standard and Advantage features.[27][28] Its Junior protection provides identity theft detection and alerts, credit file verification, black market website surveillance and file sharing network searches.[29]
LifeLock provides a $1 million guarantee in the event of identity theft.[30] The guarantee is that LifeLock will spend up to $1,000,000 on legal and associated fees necessary in restoring a customer's identity. The guarantee does not cover the direct losses such a customer incurs from identity theft or pay restitution to them for money lost.[30][31]
Marketing[edit]
LifeLock has partnered with major banks, national corporations and has celebrity endorsers.[32] In addition to sponsoring NPR programming,[citation needed] LifeLock advertises heavily on the Internet and radio; its ads can be heard on the radio shows of Paul Harvey, Rush Limbaugh, Adam Carolla, Kim Komando, and Charles Osgood.[33] Celebrity spokespersons for LifeLock have included Howard Stern, Paul Harvey, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.[34]
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]
LifeLock's advertising agency of record is Lowe Campbell Ewald.[43][44] In January 2014, LifeLock announced a new television commercial, called "Do Your Thing", and a redesigned company logo.[45]
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Starting in 2010, LifeLock has partnered with the FBI-LEEDA (Law Enforcement Executive Development Association) to provide educational seminars to law enforcement officials on identity theft.[46] The seminars occur multiple times a year in various regions throughout the United States. In February 2014, the company partnered with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with the goals of helping kids learn safe online habits.[47]
In April 2014, the company entered into partnership with Vivint to offer home and identity protection together.[48]
Controversies[edit]
Robert J. Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]

Controversies[edit]
Robert J. Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

History[edit]
LifeLock was co-founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis. Amid controversy, Maynard left the company in 2007.[5][6]
In December 2008, LifeLock entered into an agreement with TransUnion, one of the three main credit bureaus, to automate the process of alerting customers of potential unauthorized access via their credit reports.[7] LifeLock acquired ID Analytics following a round of funding in March 2012.[8] ID Analytics operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8]
Following the announcement of the company's IPO in August 2012, Hilary Schneider joined the company as president.[9] Schneider had previously been working with TPG Capital after leaving Yahoo in 2010.[9]
In December 2013, LifeLock acquired Lemon Wallet for $42.6 million.[10][11] Lemon is a digital wallet platform which stores payment, loyalty, and identification cards on members' smartphones.[12] Lemon Wallet Plus was a premium service which offered lost wallet service, account monitoring, and some security measures. Wallet Plus has been folded into a new service offered by LifeLock which includes identity fraud alerts.[12] The company temporarily removed the app from mobile stores in May 2014 when the company learned that certain parts of the app were not in compliance with payment industry standards.[13]
As of February 2014, LifeLock had 3 million subscribers.[14]
In July 2015, CNN reported that FTC and 35 United State Attorneys General deemed LifeLock in violation of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[15] In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion.[16]
ID Analytics, Inc.[edit]
In March 2012, ID Analytics, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8] ID Analytics was founded in 2002.[17] It provides consumer risk management with real-time consumer behavior insights and in-depth visibility into identity risk and creditworthiness.[18] Both government agencies and U.S. companies utilize ID Analytics for risk based decision making on revenue enhancement, fraud reduction, cost saving drivers and customer protection.[17]
Funding[edit]
The company started with $2 million in seed funding, with another $5 million in its Series A funding in 2006 from Bessemer Ventures.[19][20]
In April 2007, LifeLock raised $6 million in its series B funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[19] The following January, its Series C Funding ended with $25 million, led by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[21] In August 2009, a series D funding round raised $40 million for the company.[22] LifeLock raised $100 million in new equity funding from Bessemer Ventures Partners, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Symantec Corporation and River Street Management in March 2012.[23] The funds were used towards the acquisition of ID Analytics, an identity theft risk prediction technology.[8]
On August 28, 2012, LifeLock announced its plans to take its identity theft protection business public and filed for an initial public offering worth up to $175 million.[24] On October 3, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol LOCK, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[25]
Product[edit]
LifeLock offers Standard, Advantage, Ultimate Plus and Junior monitoring services. LifeLock Standard offers identity theft detection and alerts within its network, lost wallet protection, address change verification, black market website surveillance and reduced pre-approved credit card offers.[26] LifeLock Advantage contains everything in the Standard plan plus fictitious identity monitoring, court record scanning, and an online annual credit score and report and credit monitoring alerts through Equifax. LifeLock Ultimate Plus includes bank account takeover alerts within its network, enhanced credit application alerts and online credit reports and scores on top of the Standard and Advantage features.[27][28] Its Junior protection provides identity theft detection and alerts, credit file verification, black market website surveillance and file sharing network searches.[29]
LifeLock provides a $1 million guarantee in the event of identity theft.[30] The guarantee is that LifeLock will spend up to $1,000,000 on legal and associated fees necessary in restoring a customer's identity. The guarantee does not cover the direct losses such a customer incurs from identity theft or pay restitution to them for money lost.[30][31]
Marketing[edit]
LifeLock has partnered with major banks, national corporations and has celebrity endorsers.[32] In addition to sponsoring NPR programming,[citation needed] LifeLock advertises heavily on the Internet and radio; its ads can be heard on the radio shows of Paul Harvey, Rush Limbaugh, Adam Carolla, Kim Komando, and Charles Osgood.[33] Celebrity spokespersons for LifeLock have included Howard Stern, Paul Harvey, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.[34]
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]
LifeLock's advertising agency of record is Lowe Campbell Ewald.[43][44] In January 2014, LifeLock announced a new television commercial, called "Do Your Thing", and a redesigned company logo.[45]
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Starting in 2010, LifeLock has partnered with the FBI-LEEDA (Law Enforcement Executive Development Association) to provide educational seminars to law enforcement officials on identity theft.[46] The seminars occur multiple times a year in various regions throughout the United States. In February 2014, the company partnered with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with the goals of helping kids learn safe online habits.[47]
In April 2014, the company entered into partnership with Vivint to offer home and identity protection together.[48]
Controversies[edit]
Robert J. Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

History[edit]
LifeLock was co-founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis. Amid controversy, Maynard left the company in 2007.[5][6]
In December 2008, LifeLock entered into an agreement with TransUnion, one of the three main credit bureaus, to automate the process of alerting customers of potential unauthorized access via their credit reports.[7] LifeLock acquired ID Analytics following a round of funding in March 2012.[8] ID Analytics operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8]
Following the announcement of the company's IPO in August 2012, Hilary Schneider joined the company as president.[9] Schneider had previously been working with TPG Capital after leaving Yahoo in 2010.[9]
In December 2013, LifeLock acquired Lemon Wallet for $42.6 million.[10][11] Lemon is a digital wallet platform which stores payment, loyalty, and identification cards on members' smartphones.[12] Lemon Wallet Plus was a premium service which offered lost wallet service, account monitoring, and some security measures. Wallet Plus has been folded into a new service offered by LifeLock which includes identity fraud alerts.[12] The company temporarily removed the app from mobile stores in May 2014 when the company learned that certain parts of the app were not in compliance with payment industry standards.[13]
As of February 2014, LifeLock had 3 million subscribers.[14]
In July 2015, CNN reported that FTC and 35 United State Attorneys General deemed LifeLock in violation of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[15] In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion.[16]
ID Analytics, Inc.[edit]
In March 2012, ID Analytics, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8] ID Analytics was founded in 2002.[17] It provides consumer risk management with real-time consumer behavior insights and in-depth visibility into identity risk and creditworthiness.[18] Both government agencies and U.S. companies utilize ID Analytics for risk based decision making on revenue enhancement, fraud reduction, cost saving drivers and customer protection.[17]
Funding[edit]
The company started with $2 million in seed funding, with another $5 million in its Series A funding in 2006 from Bessemer Ventures.[19][20]
In April 2007, LifeLock raised $6 million in its series B funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[19] The following January, its Series C Funding ended with $25 million, led by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[21] In August 2009, a series D funding round raised $40 million for the company.[22] LifeLock raised $100 million in new equity funding from Bessemer Ventures Partners, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Symantec Corporation and River Street Management in March 2012.[23] The funds were used towards the acquisition of ID Analytics, an identity theft risk prediction technology.[8]
On August 28, 2012, LifeLock announced its plans to take its identity theft protection business public and filed for an initial public offering worth up to $175 million.[24] On October 3, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol LOCK, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[25]
Product[edit]
LifeLock offers Standard, Advantage, Ultimate Plus and Junior monitoring services. LifeLock Standard offers identity theft detection and alerts within its network, lost wallet protection, address change verification, black market website surveillance and reduced pre-approved credit card offers.[26] LifeLock Advantage contains everything in the Standard plan plus fictitious identity monitoring, court record scanning, and an online annual credit score and report and credit monitoring alerts through Equifax. LifeLock Ultimate Plus includes bank account takeover alerts within its network, enhanced credit application alerts and online credit reports and scores on top of the Standard and Advantage features.[27][28] Its Junior protection provides identity theft detection and alerts, credit file verification, black market website surveillance and file sharing network searches.[29]
LifeLock provides a $1 million guarantee in the event of identity theft.[30] The guarantee is that LifeLock will spend up to $1,000,000 on legal and associated fees necessary in restoring a customer's identity. The guarantee does not cover the direct losses such a customer incurs from identity theft or pay restitution to them for money lost.[30][31]

LifeLock has partnered with major banks, national corporations and has celebrity endorsers.[32] In addition to sponsoring NPR programming,[citation needed] LifeLock advertises heavily on the Internet and radio; its ads can be heard on the radio shows of Paul Harvey, Rush Limbaugh, Adam Carolla, Kim Komando, and Charles Osgood.[33] Celebrity spokespersons for LifeLock have included Howard Stern, Paul Harvey, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.[34]
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]
LifeLock's advertising agency of record is Lowe Campbell Ewald.[43][44] In January 2014, LifeLock announced a new television commercial, called "Do Your Thing", and a redesigned company logo.[45]
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Starting in 2010, LifeLock has partnered with the FBI-LEEDA (Law Enforcement Executive Development Association) to provide educational seminars to law enforcement officials on identity theft.[46] The seminars occur multiple times a year in various regions throughout the United States. In February 2014, the company partnered with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with the goals of helping kids learn safe online habits.[47]
In April 2014, the company entered into partnership with Vivint to offer home and identity protection together.[48]
Controversies[edit]
Robert J. Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

In 2015, it was ordered to pay $100 million to settle Federal Trade Commission contempt charges for failing to protect consumer information and deceptive advertising, the largest monetary award obtained by the Commission for an enforcement action.[4]

History[edit]
LifeLock was co-founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis. Amid controversy, Maynard left the company in 2007.[5][6]
In December 2008, LifeLock entered into an agreement with TransUnion, one of the three main credit bureaus, to automate the process of alerting customers of potential unauthorized access via their credit reports.[7] LifeLock acquired ID Analytics following a round of funding in March 2012.[8] ID Analytics operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8]
Following the announcement of the company's IPO in August 2012, Hilary Schneider joined the company as president.[9] Schneider had previously been working with TPG Capital after leaving Yahoo in 2010.[9]
In December 2013, LifeLock acquired Lemon Wallet for $42.6 million.[10][11] Lemon is a digital wallet platform which stores payment, loyalty, and identification cards on members' smartphones.[12] Lemon Wallet Plus was a premium service which offered lost wallet service, account monitoring, and some security measures. Wallet Plus has been folded into a new service offered by LifeLock which includes identity fraud alerts.[12] The company temporarily removed the app from mobile stores in May 2014 when the company learned that certain parts of the app were not in compliance with payment industry standards.[13]
As of February 2014, LifeLock had 3 million subscribers.[14]
In July 2015, CNN reported that FTC and 35 United State Attorneys General deemed LifeLock in violation of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[15] In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion.[16]
ID Analytics, Inc.[edit]
In March 2012, ID Analytics, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8] ID Analytics was founded in 2002.[17] It provides consumer risk management with real-time consumer behavior insights and in-depth visibility into identity risk and creditworthiness.[18] Both government agencies and U.S. companies utilize ID Analytics for risk based decision making on revenue enhancement, fraud reduction, cost saving drivers and customer protection.[17]
Funding[edit]
The company started with $2 million in seed funding, with another $5 million in its Series A funding in 2006 from Bessemer Ventures.[19][20]
In April 2007, LifeLock raised $6 million in its series B funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[19] The following January, its Series C Funding ended with $25 million, led by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[21] In August 2009, a series D funding round raised $40 million for the company.[22] LifeLock raised $100 million in new equity funding from Bessemer Ventures Partners, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Symantec Corporation and River Street Management in March 2012.[23] The funds were used towards the acquisition of ID Analytics, an identity theft risk prediction technology.[8]
On August 28, 2012, LifeLock announced its plans to take its identity theft protection business public and filed for an initial public offering worth up to $175 million.[24] On October 3, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol LOCK, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[25]
Product[edit]
LifeLock offers Standard, Advantage, Ultimate Plus and Junior monitoring services. LifeLock Standard offers identity theft detection and alerts within its network, lost wallet protection, address change verification, black market website surveillance and reduced pre-approved credit card offers.[26] LifeLock Advantage contains everything in the Standard plan plus fictitious identity monitoring, court record scanning, and an online annual credit score and report and credit monitoring alerts through Equifax. LifeLock Ultimate Plus includes bank account takeover alerts within its network, enhanced credit application alerts and online credit reports and scores on top of the Standard and Advantage features.[27][28] Its Junior protection provides identity theft detection and alerts, credit file verification, black market website surveillance and file sharing network searches.[29]
LifeLock provides a $1 million guarantee in the event of identity theft.[30] The guarantee is that LifeLock will spend up to $1,000,000 on legal and associated fees necessary in restoring a customer's identity. The guarantee does not cover the direct losses such a customer incurs from identity theft or pay restitution to them for money lost.[30][31]
Marketing[edit]
LifeLock has partnered with major banks, national corporations and has celebrity endorsers.[32] In addition to sponsoring NPR programming,[citation needed] LifeLock advertises heavily on the Internet and radio; its ads can be heard on the radio shows of Paul Harvey, Rush Limbaugh, Adam Carolla, Kim Komando, and Charles Osgood.[33] Celebrity spokespersons for LifeLock have included Howard Stern, Paul Harvey, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.[34]
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]
LifeLock's advertising agency of record is Lowe Campbell Ewald.[43][44] In January 2014, LifeLock announced a new television commercial, called "Do Your Thing", and a redesigned company logo.[45]
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Starting in 2010, LifeLock has partnered with the FBI-LEEDA (Law Enforcement Executive Development Association) to provide educational seminars to law enforcement officials on identity theft.[46] The seminars occur multiple times a year in various regions throughout the United States. In February 2014, the company partnered with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with the goals of helping kids learn safe online habits.[47]
In April 2014, the company entered into partnership with Vivint to offer home and identity protection together.[48]
Controversies[edit]
Robert J. Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
