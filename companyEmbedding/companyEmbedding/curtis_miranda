Jacksonville.com: 2000 A.D.: Top 100 Athletes: Curtis Miranda
















 










































 



Athletes of the Century: Curtis Miranda











NUMBER 84
Curtis Miranda/Football
Age: 61
High School: Gilbert
College: Florida A&M
Accomplishments: A three-time All-America center in
college and one of only three FAMU players (Willie Galimore
and Tyrone McGriff are the others) to achieve that feat. . . .
FAMU went 29-1 in his last three seasons (1959-61) and won two
black college national championships. . . . Inducted into the
FAMU athletic Hall of Fame in 1979. . . . Drafted by the New
York Giants in the fifth round in 1962 as a middle linebacker
and in the 11th round as a center by the AFL New York Titans
(Jets). Signed with Giants but never made their active roster.
Played one season with the Hamilton Tiger Cats in the Canadian
Football League.  Released after the team had to cut down to
three American players. . . . Played on Gilbert High teams
from 1954-56 that went a combined 28-2.
Deserving because: Was an intimidating presence on some of
coach Jake Gaither's best teams at FAMU. Not making the NFL
may have been due, in part, to the league having no black
players at his linebacker position until Willie Lanier in
1967.
On Miranda: "He wasn't that much bigger than anybody else,
but he was muscular, agile and very quick on his feet. He was
tough and mean, the best lineman I ever coached."  --  Earl
Kitchings Sr., former Gilbert High football coach. 
Where he is now: Living in Jacksonville, working as a supervisor
for Sealand Container Inc., a longshoremen company.

Life[edit]
Born New Haven, Vermont, to American Revolutionary Soldier, William Lampson (1761–1827) and Rachel Powell (1766–1813), he started work as a clerk before moving to New York and then, in 1830, to London as John Jacob Astor's agent. He established the business of C.M. Lampson & Co. and became a naturalised British citizen on 14 May 1849.[1]
He was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company on its formation in 1856 and served it over the next decade. His endeavours, along with those of the other principals, were recognised on 16 November 1866 when Lampson was created a baronet.[2] He is said to have been the first former US citizen to have been so honoured. His other appointments included as deputy governor of the Hudson's Bay Company and as one of the trustees of the Peabody Donation Fund.[1]
Lampson died at his country seat, Rowfant, in West Sussex and was buried at Worth Church near Crawley.
Family[edit]
He was married to Jane Sibley, a distant relation of the Confederate general Henry Hopkins Sibley. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son George. His second son Henry pre-deceased him. His youngest son Norman George was the father of the prominent diplomat Miles Wedderburn Lampson, who was elevated to the peerage as Baron Killearn in 1943. His only daughter, Hannah Jane, was married to the poet Frederick Locker. Their children included the British Conservative MPs, Godfrey Locker-Lampson and Oliver Locker-Lampson.
His son-in-law Frederick Locker-Lampson included this pen portrait of Sir Curtis in his posthumously published memoirs, My Confidences (1896): "I am told that as a youth he was wise beyond his years and intelligent in advance of his experience ... He has foresight, judgment, a clear apprehension of men and affairs, a strong will and a sweet temper, and his success in life may be attributed to his own and sole exertions - Sapientia duce, fortuna permittente." His grandson, Godfrey Locker-Lampson, wrote of him:

Wherever he went people would regard him with attention and admiration, for he was tall and broad-shouldered, with a distinguished carriage and handsome head. There was a great dignity about him and yet a gentleness that won you over, a grave somewhat stern expression, but illumined by a smile that was irresistible; and combined with all these, a character for intergrity in all his dealings that nothing ever smirched.[3]
