About Huber


	Our History

Founded in 1883, the J.M. Huber Corporation has grown to be one of the largest family-owned companies in the U.S. We’re now a global company with approximately 4,000 employees in more than 20 countries. We are guided by a spirit of creativity and innovation that transforms ideas into products that meet the challenges of an evolving world. And we do all this while honoring a commitment to the Huber Principles:


		Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) Sustainability

		Ethical Behavior

		Respect for People

		Excellence




	The Beginnings

	J.M. Huber Corporation started with Joseph Maria Huber's trip to New York City to develop new markets for his family's dry color business.

	Dry colors are pigments used to produce inks. Five years later, J.M. Huber's customer base was centered on the import and distribution of the family's dry colors. Today, as one of the largest family-owned companies in the United States, the multinational company has grown to encompass the manufacture and supply of engineered materials, natural resources and technology-based services and serves a wide range of industries.

	This fifth-generation family company has always provided solutions that its customers can trust. J.M. Huber's close relationship and readiness to help customers was a common practice and one that has been passed down as a guiding principle of the company for over a century. Mr. Huber always found a solution, even when a fire burned his Brooklyn plant to the ground in 1913. Within 48 hours, he had production up and running again in a rented space. This solution-driven business practice became the foundation upon which the company grew.

	J.M. Huber Corporation now works with a broad range of industries to provide both products and services. Its businesses include three sectors: Engineered Materials, Natural Resources and Technology-Based Service. For more information on J.M. Huber Corporation, please visit www.huber.com


	Huber Engineered Woods

Successful Creativity is a fundamental principle at Huber Engineered Woods. We search for new ways to solve problems. We never settle for the expected or accepted norm, and always search for methods that will help us deliver the highest quality products and service possible. It's a different way of doing business. Not just innovative thinking, not simply maverick approaches, but creativity that makes a difference.

	With a dedicated R&D Group, we develop products to solve specific problems and to meet specific customer needs. We operate under a philosophy of continuous improvement in quality products, and value customer input, seeking their ideas on product enhancements or new products needed to fill market voids. Imagine a company that consistently surprises its customers with innovative products, yet keeps those products affordable. People want to do business with a company they can trust to help them resolve problems and deliver on their promises. That company is Huber.


	Our People

	From the expert scientists in research and development to the dedicated sales team, Huber Engineered Woods' primary goal is to provide solutions for customers across an array of industries. Huber's cutting-edge advances in the way its products are made and installed make customers ask for them by name. And, the reputation of the company's people as partners in industry solutions is one that has never wavered during the 125 years since the company's inception.
