NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alcoa (NYSE:AA) announced today that Ken Giacobbe has been named Chief 
      Financial Officer of its Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS) 
      business group, effective immediately.
    


      Giacobbe has served as Controller of Alcoa Engineered Products and 
      Solutions since 2011. In his new role, Giacobbe will have financial 
      responsibility for the EPS business, which includes Alcoa Power and 
      Propulsion, Alcoa Fastening Systems, Alcoa Forgings and Extrusions, 
      Alcoa Wheel and Transportation Products, and Building and Construction 
      Systems. EPS had 2012 revenues of $5.5 billion and employs approximately 
      22,000 people in 17 countries.
    

      Giacobbe also will serve on Alcoa’s Executive Council, the senior 
      leadership team that sets strategic direction for the company.
    

      “Ken has held positions of increasing responsibility in Finance at the 
      company, most recently as EPS’ Group Controller where he helped the 
      Group achieve record results,” said Olivier Jarrault, Executive Vice 
      President and Group President, Engineered Products and Solutions. “His 
      global experience combined with his demonstrated focus on execution will 
      be key to EPS’ global revenue growth and its continued year-over-year 
      financial performance improvement.”
    

      Giacobbe joined Alcoa in 2004 as Vice President of Finance for Global 
      Extruded Products, part of Alcoa Forgings and Extrusions. After that, he 
      was Vice President of Finance for Building and Construction Systems, and 
      Group Controller for EPS.
    

      Earlier in his career, Giacobbe held Senior Finance roles at Avaya and 
      Lucent Technologies, among others. He earned a Bachelor’s Degree in 
      Economics from the State University of New York at Oneonta and an MBA 
      from the University of South Florida.
    

      Giacobbe will be based in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, with the EPS 
      Finance Team. His successor will be named shortly, and will report to 
      him.
