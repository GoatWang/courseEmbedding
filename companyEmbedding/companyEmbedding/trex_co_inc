Deck Framing & Drainage Systems







A behind-the-scenes performance
The mark of truly smart design occurs when the pieces you don’t see are as innovative as the beauty you do. Our under-deck drainage and framing systems are as smart as our high-performance decking, making Trex® an all-around luxury partner for the outdoors.









Trex Elevations® Steel Deck Framing
By designing an under-deck framing system with the outdoors in mind, we've reinvented the concept, creating a remarkably stable and consistently flat, triple-coated steel substructure on which to build a high-performance deck—something other deck frames could only dream about.











Trex® RainEscape® Drainage System
A unique under-deck drainage system–a network of troughs and gutters–keeps rain, spills and snow melt from dripping through elevated deck boards, creating a dry patio area on the ground level below.











Trex® Protect™ Joist and Beam Tape
Ensure the life of your deck with our protective joist and beam tapes.

Works Well With









Transcend Decking
In seven matching colors, Transcend railing and decking are a flawless pair, inspiring both monochromatic and complementary designs all with the same high-performance, low-maintenance finish.











The Metro Collection
Roof deck? Railing. And the sturdier the better. Of course, if it’s the cosmopolitan look you’re after, turn to Transcend deck railing for our high-performance yet low-profile lengths in–what else?–chic black.











The Tropical Collection
The islands inspire so much: great views, breezy gatherings. To take a cue, try glass panels* instead of balusters for a nearly invisible look, then swap in an aptly named cocktail rail for a traditional handrail and let the gatherings begin. *glass panels sold separately

Trex Composite Decking[edit]




Trex Composite Decking


Trex is widely considered as one of the inventors of composite decking made from recyclable materials.[12] The idea for a process and product created to maximize the use of materials that would otherwise wind up in landfills is credited to inventors Kjell-Ake Gustafsson, of Binghamton, NY; John J. Muller, of Winchester, VA; and Roger A. Wittenberg of Newton, PA.[13]
Company Patent[edit]
The first patent for a “Method of Producing a Wood-Thermoplastic Composite Material” was filed as U.S. Patent number 5746958 in March 1995 and granted in May 1998. The Assignee was Trex Company LLC, operating in Winchester, VA.[13] The process abstract for the creation of composite decking is: “A method for producing a wood-thermoplastic composite material using a high bulk density feedstock. Since the feedstock is easy to handle it provides manufacturers with lots of control over the process. Prompted by the prospect of environmental regulations mandating recycled materials, this process uses spent sawdust and plastic material rather than disposing of it.”[13]
Manufacturing Processes[edit]
Trex continues to employ a process that combines different materials, mostly wood and plastic, that are formed to create a product that has the appearance of wood. The wood content in Trex products is largely wood byproducts like sawdust, wood pallets, wood chips and wood fiber. The polyethylene plastic continues to be mostly recycled materials from commonly discarded items like stretch wrap, packaging films, grocery and retail bags and case/carton/product overwraps.[14] Trex uses about 100,000 tons of waste polyethylene film each year and claims to keep 200,000 tons of plastic and hardwood scraps out of American landfills each year.[15] Over 120,000 pieces of post consumer film (packaging, bags, overwraps, etc.) can be used to create a 500-square-foot Trex deck.[16] The components are mixed and a pigment and preservative are added during the process. The mixture is then heated, formed into a board shape, and cooled.[14]
Transcend Decking[edit]
In 2009 Trex introduced a ‘Transcend’ line of decking [17] that is a co-extruded composite decking product that includes a shell around the composite boards on three sides to protect the boards from staining, fading and scratching.[18] The Trex Transcend line of decking claims a recycled content rate of 95.4%.[19]

Environmental Record[edit]
Trex promotes an environmental stance as part of its commercial appeal in the marketplace.[21] In public materials, Trex Company, Inc. cites that no trees are cut down to make Trex decking products; that the company uses vegetable-based oil hydraulics in transportation trailers; and that it recycles factory waste back into the manufacturing line.[20]
Recycled Components[edit]
Trex composite decking contains 97% recycled content and offers verification by ICC-ES.[22] In July 2010 Trex received a Verification of Attributes Report (VAR-1011) from the International Code Council Evaluation Service (ICC-ES) under the Sustainable Attributes Verification and Evaluation Program. The verification validates Trex’s wood-alternative products are manufactured with a minimum of 95.4% recycled content. Trex claims is the first composite decking manufacturer to obtain this certification.[22]
Environmental Affiliations[edit]
Trex has been a member of the Green Building Council, a trade group promoting environmentally friendly building practices, (USGBC) since 2009. USGBC is best known for the widely recognized LEED program (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design).[23]
Through the LEED point-based system, the use of Trex decking and railing products add points based on the percentage of recycled product content.[20]
Environmental Programs[edit]
Trex conducts and participates in eco-friendly educational and recycling programs in various parts of the United States.[21] Since 2006, students at selected schools throughout the East Coast and Midwest have participated in a ‘Trex Plastic Bag Challenge’ (recently renamed ‘Plastic Film Recycling Challenge’[20] ). Students collect plastic bags in exchange for a gift of Trex benches to participating schools.[24]
The company has also provided in-kind contributions, financial assistance and expertise to environmental projects around the country. These include:

The BASF Near Zero Energy Home in Paterson, NJ.[25]
The Maui Wildlife Refuge Complex, Kealia Pond NWR in Hawaii. The two-year participation included the construction of a 2,200-foot pedestrian boardwalk in 2005 and boardwalk upgrades using Trex decking materials for a total value of $600,000 in 2006.[26]
The Solar Decathlon, a collegiate green building competition.[24]
The Point Defiance Zoo, a theater and Kids Zone in Tacoma, WA.[24]
The National Building Museum’s ‘The Green House Exhibit’ in Washington, D.C.[27]

Environmental Recognition[edit]
Trex corporate participation in environmental efforts, coupled with its eco-friendly product profile, has led to recognition by governments, publications and trade groups.
These include:

The 2013 ‘Green Award’ from Washingtonian Magazine. The award recognizes citizens, companies and organizations in the DC Metro area working to improve the environment and encourage eco-friendly living.[28]
The Green Builder Media’s 2013 Reader’s Choice Awards, earning more than 40% of the vote for the ‘greenest’ decking in the industry.[29]
The ‘Excellence in Plastics Recycling’ award from the Society of Plastic Engineers Recycling Division. The award is given based on plastic volume, type and the success of the resulting products.[30]
In 2005 Trex was given the ‘Green Award’ by Winslow Management Company in recognition of companies that contribute positively to both the environment and shareholders.[31]

Trex Composite Decking[edit]




Trex Composite Decking


Trex is widely considered as one of the inventors of composite decking made from recyclable materials.[12] The idea for a process and product created to maximize the use of materials that would otherwise wind up in landfills is credited to inventors Kjell-Ake Gustafsson, of Binghamton, NY; John J. Muller, of Winchester, VA; and Roger A. Wittenberg of Newton, PA.[13]
Company Patent[edit]
The first patent for a “Method of Producing a Wood-Thermoplastic Composite Material” was filed as U.S. Patent number 5746958 in March 1995 and granted in May 1998. The Assignee was Trex Company LLC, operating in Winchester, VA.[13] The process abstract for the creation of composite decking is: “A method for producing a wood-thermoplastic composite material using a high bulk density feedstock. Since the feedstock is easy to handle it provides manufacturers with lots of control over the process. Prompted by the prospect of environmental regulations mandating recycled materials, this process uses spent sawdust and plastic material rather than disposing of it.”[13]
Manufacturing Processes[edit]
Trex continues to employ a process that combines different materials, mostly wood and plastic, that are formed to create a product that has the appearance of wood. The wood content in Trex products is largely wood byproducts like sawdust, wood pallets, wood chips and wood fiber. The polyethylene plastic continues to be mostly recycled materials from commonly discarded items like stretch wrap, packaging films, grocery and retail bags and case/carton/product overwraps.[14] Trex uses about 100,000 tons of waste polyethylene film each year and claims to keep 200,000 tons of plastic and hardwood scraps out of American landfills each year.[15] Over 120,000 pieces of post consumer film (packaging, bags, overwraps, etc.) can be used to create a 500-square-foot Trex deck.[16] The components are mixed and a pigment and preservative are added during the process. The mixture is then heated, formed into a board shape, and cooled.[14]
Transcend Decking[edit]
In 2009 Trex introduced a ‘Transcend’ line of decking [17] that is a co-extruded composite decking product that includes a shell around the composite boards on three sides to protect the boards from staining, fading and scratching.[18] The Trex Transcend line of decking claims a recycled content rate of 95.4%.[19]
Products[edit]

Trex products include:[20]

Environmental Record[edit]
Trex promotes an environmental stance as part of its commercial appeal in the marketplace.[21] In public materials, Trex Company, Inc. cites that no trees are cut down to make Trex decking products; that the company uses vegetable-based oil hydraulics in transportation trailers; and that it recycles factory waste back into the manufacturing line.[20]
Recycled Components[edit]
Trex composite decking contains 97% recycled content and offers verification by ICC-ES.[22] In July 2010 Trex received a Verification of Attributes Report (VAR-1011) from the International Code Council Evaluation Service (ICC-ES) under the Sustainable Attributes Verification and Evaluation Program. The verification validates Trex’s wood-alternative products are manufactured with a minimum of 95.4% recycled content. Trex claims is the first composite decking manufacturer to obtain this certification.[22]
Environmental Affiliations[edit]
Trex has been a member of the Green Building Council, a trade group promoting environmentally friendly building practices, (USGBC) since 2009. USGBC is best known for the widely recognized LEED program (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design).[23]
Through the LEED point-based system, the use of Trex decking and railing products add points based on the percentage of recycled product content.[20]
Environmental Programs[edit]
Trex conducts and participates in eco-friendly educational and recycling programs in various parts of the United States.[21] Since 2006, students at selected schools throughout the East Coast and Midwest have participated in a ‘Trex Plastic Bag Challenge’ (recently renamed ‘Plastic Film Recycling Challenge’[20] ). Students collect plastic bags in exchange for a gift of Trex benches to participating schools.[24]
The company has also provided in-kind contributions, financial assistance and expertise to environmental projects around the country. These include:

The BASF Near Zero Energy Home in Paterson, NJ.[25]
The Maui Wildlife Refuge Complex, Kealia Pond NWR in Hawaii. The two-year participation included the construction of a 2,200-foot pedestrian boardwalk in 2005 and boardwalk upgrades using Trex decking materials for a total value of $600,000 in 2006.[26]
The Solar Decathlon, a collegiate green building competition.[24]
The Point Defiance Zoo, a theater and Kids Zone in Tacoma, WA.[24]
The National Building Museum’s ‘The Green House Exhibit’ in Washington, D.C.[27]

Environmental Recognition[edit]
Trex corporate participation in environmental efforts, coupled with its eco-friendly product profile, has led to recognition by governments, publications and trade groups.
These include:

The 2013 ‘Green Award’ from Washingtonian Magazine. The award recognizes citizens, companies and organizations in the DC Metro area working to improve the environment and encourage eco-friendly living.[28]
The Green Builder Media’s 2013 Reader’s Choice Awards, earning more than 40% of the vote for the ‘greenest’ decking in the industry.[29]
The ‘Excellence in Plastics Recycling’ award from the Society of Plastic Engineers Recycling Division. The award is given based on plastic volume, type and the success of the resulting products.[30]
In 2005 Trex was given the ‘Green Award’ by Winslow Management Company in recognition of companies that contribute positively to both the environment and shareholders.[31]
The Governor of Virginia’s Environmental Excellence First Place Award. Trex has received this award twice. First, in 2001, for building a nature trail on Teddy Roosevelt Island in Arlington, VA and again in 2003 for ‘Outstanding Environmental Project’ in the Smaller Manufacturer’s category.[32]

Trex Composite Decking[edit]




Trex Composite Decking


Trex is widely considered as one of the inventors of composite decking made from recyclable materials.[12] The idea for a process and product created to maximize the use of materials that would otherwise wind up in landfills is credited to inventors Kjell-Ake Gustafsson, of Binghamton, NY; John J. Muller, of Winchester, VA; and Roger A. Wittenberg of Newton, PA.[13]
Company Patent[edit]
The first patent for a “Method of Producing a Wood-Thermoplastic Composite Material” was filed as U.S. Patent number 5746958 in March 1995 and granted in May 1998. The Assignee was Trex Company LLC, operating in Winchester, VA.[13] The process abstract for the creation of composite decking is: “A method for producing a wood-thermoplastic composite material using a high bulk density feedstock. Since the feedstock is easy to handle it provides manufacturers with lots of control over the process. Prompted by the prospect of environmental regulations mandating recycled materials, this process uses spent sawdust and plastic material rather than disposing of it.”[13]
Manufacturing Processes[edit]
Trex continues to employ a process that combines different materials, mostly wood and plastic, that are formed to create a product that has the appearance of wood. The wood content in Trex products is largely wood byproducts like sawdust, wood pallets, wood chips and wood fiber. The polyethylene plastic continues to be mostly recycled materials from commonly discarded items like stretch wrap, packaging films, grocery and retail bags and case/carton/product overwraps.[14] Trex uses about 100,000 tons of waste polyethylene film each year and claims to keep 200,000 tons of plastic and hardwood scraps out of American landfills each year.[15] Over 120,000 pieces of post consumer film (packaging, bags, overwraps, etc.) can be used to create a 500-square-foot Trex deck.[16] The components are mixed and a pigment and preservative are added during the process. The mixture is then heated, formed into a board shape, and cooled.[14]
Transcend Decking[edit]
In 2009 Trex introduced a ‘Transcend’ line of decking [17] that is a co-extruded composite decking product that includes a shell around the composite boards on three sides to protect the boards from staining, fading and scratching.[18] The Trex Transcend line of decking claims a recycled content rate of 95.4%.[19]
Products[edit]

Environmental Record[edit]
Trex promotes an environmental stance as part of its commercial appeal in the marketplace.[21] In public materials, Trex Company, Inc. cites that no trees are cut down to make Trex decking products; that the company uses vegetable-based oil hydraulics in transportation trailers; and that it recycles factory waste back into the manufacturing line.[20]
Recycled Components[edit]
Trex composite decking contains 97% recycled content and offers verification by ICC-ES.[22] In July 2010 Trex received a Verification of Attributes Report (VAR-1011) from the International Code Council Evaluation Service (ICC-ES) under the Sustainable Attributes Verification and Evaluation Program. The verification validates Trex’s wood-alternative products are manufactured with a minimum of 95.4% recycled content. Trex claims is the first composite decking manufacturer to obtain this certification.[22]
Environmental Affiliations[edit]
Trex has been a member of the Green Building Council, a trade group promoting environmentally friendly building practices, (USGBC) since 2009. USGBC is best known for the widely recognized LEED program (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design).[23]
Through the LEED point-based system, the use of Trex decking and railing products add points based on the percentage of recycled product content.[20]
Environmental Programs[edit]
Trex conducts and participates in eco-friendly educational and recycling programs in various parts of the United States.[21] Since 2006, students at selected schools throughout the East Coast and Midwest have participated in a ‘Trex Plastic Bag Challenge’ (recently renamed ‘Plastic Film Recycling Challenge’[20] ). Students collect plastic bags in exchange for a gift of Trex benches to participating schools.[24]
The company has also provided in-kind contributions, financial assistance and expertise to environmental projects around the country. These include:

The BASF Near Zero Energy Home in Paterson, NJ.[25]
The Maui Wildlife Refuge Complex, Kealia Pond NWR in Hawaii. The two-year participation included the construction of a 2,200-foot pedestrian boardwalk in 2005 and boardwalk upgrades using Trex decking materials for a total value of $600,000 in 2006.[26]
The Solar Decathlon, a collegiate green building competition.[24]
The Point Defiance Zoo, a theater and Kids Zone in Tacoma, WA.[24]
The National Building Museum’s ‘The Green House Exhibit’ in Washington, D.C.[27]

Environmental Recognition[edit]
Trex corporate participation in environmental efforts, coupled with its eco-friendly product profile, has led to recognition by governments, publications and trade groups.
These include:

The 2013 ‘Green Award’ from Washingtonian Magazine. The award recognizes citizens, companies and organizations in the DC Metro area working to improve the environment and encourage eco-friendly living.[28]
The Green Builder Media’s 2013 Reader’s Choice Awards, earning more than 40% of the vote for the ‘greenest’ decking in the industry.[29]
The ‘Excellence in Plastics Recycling’ award from the Society of Plastic Engineers Recycling Division. The award is given based on plastic volume, type and the success of the resulting products.[30]
In 2005 Trex was given the ‘Green Award’ by Winslow Management Company in recognition of companies that contribute positively to both the environment and shareholders.[31]
The Governor of Virginia’s Environmental Excellence First Place Award. Trex has received this award twice. First, in 2001, for building a nature trail on Teddy Roosevelt Island in Arlington, VA and again in 2003 for ‘Outstanding Environmental Project’ in the Smaller Manufacturer’s category.[32]

Controversy[edit]
Lawsuit: A manufacturing problem at the Trex manufacturing facility in Fernley, Nevada led to the production of some decking boards from 2002 to 2007 that were prone to surface flaking. These boards were sold throughout 16 Western states in the U.S. and resulted in a class action suit against the company.[54] In a settlement approved in 2010[55] Trex agreed to replace any decking boards, including some resulting labor costs, for decking affected by surface flaking.[54]

Trex Composite Decking[edit]




Trex Composite Decking


Trex is widely considered as one of the inventors of composite decking made from recyclable materials.[12] The idea for a process and product created to maximize the use of materials that would otherwise wind up in landfills is credited to inventors Kjell-Ake Gustafsson, of Binghamton, NY; John J. Muller, of Winchester, VA; and Roger A. Wittenberg of Newton, PA.[13]
Company Patent[edit]
The first patent for a “Method of Producing a Wood-Thermoplastic Composite Material” was filed as U.S. Patent number 5746958 in March 1995 and granted in May 1998. The Assignee was Trex Company LLC, operating in Winchester, VA.[13] The process abstract for the creation of composite decking is: “A method for producing a wood-thermoplastic composite material using a high bulk density feedstock. Since the feedstock is easy to handle it provides manufacturers with lots of control over the process. Prompted by the prospect of environmental regulations mandating recycled materials, this process uses spent sawdust and plastic material rather than disposing of it.”[13]
Manufacturing Processes[edit]
Trex continues to employ a process that combines different materials, mostly wood and plastic, that are formed to create a product that has the appearance of wood. The wood content in Trex products is largely wood byproducts like sawdust, wood pallets, wood chips and wood fiber. The polyethylene plastic continues to be mostly recycled materials from commonly discarded items like stretch wrap, packaging films, grocery and retail bags and case/carton/product overwraps.[14] Trex uses about 100,000 tons of waste polyethylene film each year and claims to keep 200,000 tons of plastic and hardwood scraps out of American landfills each year.[15] Over 120,000 pieces of post consumer film (packaging, bags, overwraps, etc.) can be used to create a 500-square-foot Trex deck.[16] The components are mixed and a pigment and preservative are added during the process. The mixture is then heated, formed into a board shape, and cooled.[14]
Transcend Decking[edit]
In 2009 Trex introduced a ‘Transcend’ line of decking [17] that is a co-extruded composite decking product that includes a shell around the composite boards on three sides to protect the boards from staining, fading and scratching.[18] The Trex Transcend line of decking claims a recycled content rate of 95.4%.[19]
Products[edit]

Environmental Record[edit]
Trex promotes an environmental stance as part of its commercial appeal in the marketplace.[21] In public materials, Trex Company, Inc. cites that no trees are cut down to make Trex decking products; that the company uses vegetable-based oil hydraulics in transportation trailers; and that it recycles factory waste back into the manufacturing line.[20]
Recycled Components[edit]
Trex composite decking contains 97% recycled content and offers verification by ICC-ES.[22] In July 2010 Trex received a Verification of Attributes Report (VAR-1011) from the International Code Council Evaluation Service (ICC-ES) under the Sustainable Attributes Verification and Evaluation Program. The verification validates Trex’s wood-alternative products are manufactured with a minimum of 95.4% recycled content. Trex claims is the first composite decking manufacturer to obtain this certification.[22]
Environmental Affiliations[edit]
Trex has been a member of the Green Building Council, a trade group promoting environmentally friendly building practices, (USGBC) since 2009. USGBC is best known for the widely recognized LEED program (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design).[23]
Through the LEED point-based system, the use of Trex decking and railing products add points based on the percentage of recycled product content.[20]
Environmental Programs[edit]
Trex conducts and participates in eco-friendly educational and recycling programs in various parts of the United States.[21] Since 2006, students at selected schools throughout the East Coast and Midwest have participated in a ‘Trex Plastic Bag Challenge’ (recently renamed ‘Plastic Film Recycling Challenge’[20] ). Students collect plastic bags in exchange for a gift of Trex benches to participating schools.[24]
The company has also provided in-kind contributions, financial assistance and expertise to environmental projects around the country. These include:

The BASF Near Zero Energy Home in Paterson, NJ.[25]
The Maui Wildlife Refuge Complex, Kealia Pond NWR in Hawaii. The two-year participation included the construction of a 2,200-foot pedestrian boardwalk in 2005 and boardwalk upgrades using Trex decking materials for a total value of $600,000 in 2006.[26]
The Solar Decathlon, a collegiate green building competition.[24]
The Point Defiance Zoo, a theater and Kids Zone in Tacoma, WA.[24]
The National Building Museum’s ‘The Green House Exhibit’ in Washington, D.C.[27]

Environmental Recognition[edit]
Trex corporate participation in environmental efforts, coupled with its eco-friendly product profile, has led to recognition by governments, publications and trade groups.
These include:

The 2013 ‘Green Award’ from Washingtonian Magazine. The award recognizes citizens, companies and organizations in the DC Metro area working to improve the environment and encourage eco-friendly living.[28]
The Green Builder Media’s 2013 Reader’s Choice Awards, earning more than 40% of the vote for the ‘greenest’ decking in the industry.[29]

In 2005 Trex was given the ‘Green Award’ by Winslow Management Company in recognition of companies that contribute positively to both the environment and shareholders.[31]
The Governor of Virginia’s Environmental Excellence First Place Award. Trex has received this award twice. First, in 2001, for building a nature trail on Teddy Roosevelt Island in Arlington, VA and again in 2003 for ‘Outstanding Environmental Project’ in the Smaller Manufacturer’s category.[32]

Controversy[edit]
Lawsuit: A manufacturing problem at the Trex manufacturing facility in Fernley, Nevada led to the production of some decking boards from 2002 to 2007 that were prone to surface flaking. These boards were sold throughout 16 Western states in the U.S. and resulted in a class action suit against the company.[54] In a settlement approved in 2010[55] Trex agreed to replace any decking boards, including some resulting labor costs, for decking affected by surface flaking.[54]

The polyethylene plastic continues to be mostly recycled materials from commonly discarded items like stretch wrap, packaging films, grocery and retail bags and case/carton/product overwraps.[14] Trex uses about 100,000 tons of waste polyethylene film each year and claims to keep 200,000 tons of plastic and hardwood scraps out of American landfills each year.[15] Over 120,000 pieces of post consumer film (packaging, bags, overwraps, etc.) can be used to create a 500-square-foot Trex deck.[16] The components are mixed and a pigment and preservative are added during the process. The mixture is then heated, formed into a board shape, and cooled.[14]
Transcend Decking[edit]
In 2009 Trex introduced a ‘Transcend’ line of decking [17] that is a co-extruded composite decking product that includes a shell around the composite boards on three sides to protect the boards from staining, fading and scratching.[18] The Trex Transcend line of decking claims a recycled content rate of 95.4%.[19]

Environmental Record[edit]
Trex promotes an environmental stance as part of its commercial appeal in the marketplace.[21] In public materials, Trex Company, Inc. cites that no trees are cut down to make Trex decking products; that the company uses vegetable-based oil hydraulics in transportation trailers; and that it recycles factory waste back into the manufacturing line.[20]
Recycled Components[edit]
Trex composite decking contains 97% recycled content and offers verification by ICC-ES.[22] In July 2010 Trex received a Verification of Attributes Report (VAR-1011) from the International Code Council Evaluation Service (ICC-ES) under the Sustainable Attributes Verification and Evaluation Program. The verification validates Trex’s wood-alternative products are manufactured with a minimum of 95.4% recycled content. Trex claims is the first composite decking manufacturer to obtain this certification.[22]
Environmental Affiliations[edit]
Trex has been a member of the Green Building Council, a trade group promoting environmentally friendly building practices, (USGBC) since 2009. USGBC is best known for the widely recognized LEED program (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design).[23]
Through the LEED point-based system, the use of Trex decking and railing products add points based on the percentage of recycled product content.[20]
Environmental Programs[edit]
Trex conducts and participates in eco-friendly educational and recycling programs in various parts of the United States.[21] Since 2006, students at selected schools throughout the East Coast and Midwest have participated in a ‘Trex Plastic Bag Challenge’ (recently renamed ‘Plastic Film Recycling Challenge’[20] ). Students collect plastic bags in exchange for a gift of Trex benches to participating schools.[24]
The company has also provided in-kind contributions, financial assistance and expertise to environmental projects around the country. These include:

The BASF Near Zero Energy Home in Paterson, NJ.[25]
The Maui Wildlife Refuge Complex, Kealia Pond NWR in Hawaii. The two-year participation included the construction of a 2,200-foot pedestrian boardwalk in 2005 and boardwalk upgrades using Trex decking materials for a total value of $600,000 in 2006.[26]
The Solar Decathlon, a collegiate green building competition.[24]
The Point Defiance Zoo, a theater and Kids Zone in Tacoma, WA.[24]
The National Building Museum’s ‘The Green House Exhibit’ in Washington, D.C.[27]

Environmental Recognition[edit]
Trex corporate participation in environmental efforts, coupled with its eco-friendly product profile, has led to recognition by governments, publications and trade groups.
These include:

The 2013 ‘Green Award’ from Washingtonian Magazine. The award recognizes citizens, companies and organizations in the DC Metro area working to improve the environment and encourage eco-friendly living.[28]

Controversy[edit]
Lawsuit: A manufacturing problem at the Trex manufacturing facility in Fernley, Nevada led to the production of some decking boards from 2002 to 2007 that were prone to surface flaking. These boards were sold throughout 16 Western states in the U.S. and resulted in a class action suit against the company.[54] In a settlement approved in 2010[55] Trex agreed to replace any decking boards, including some resulting labor costs, for decking affected by surface flaking.[54]

            Trex Company is one of the nation's largest manufacturers of composite decking and railing, with more than 13 years of product experience. Products are marketed under the brand name Trex. Made from a unique formulation of reclaimed wood and plastic combined through a proprietary process, Trex s decking and railing products offer significant design flexibility with fewer ongoing maintenance requirements than wood. Trex Company turns millions of pounds of recycled and reclaimed plastic and waste wood each year into Trex decking. Most of these raw materials come from recycled plastic grocery bags, reclaimed pallet wrap and waste wood. The company purchases approximately 300 million pounds of used polyethylene and hardwood sawdust each year, materials that would normally end up in a landfill. Trex Company is located in Fernley, Nev.

Relax On The Trex Deck This Summer (And The Next 2-3) - Trex Co. Inc. (NYSE:TREX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Relax On The Trex Deck This Summer (And The Next 2-3)Jun. 5.17 | About: Trex Co. (TREX) Caleb Jensema Growth, dividend growth investing, REITsSummaryTrex may be considered a commodity - but it does have a moat.The company has vast growth opportunities with few decks made of wood-alternative products.A housing market made up mostly of millennials who value sustainable products will support the market penetration of wood-alternative products.The company reported a solid Q1 and issued positive guidance for Q2. Introduction For those reading who are unaware, Trex (NYSE:TREX), is a manufacturer of railing and fencing products as well as wood-alternative decking. The latter perhaps being what it is best known for. Trex has over 40% of the market and has been seeing its market share grow each year thanks to a strong name brand as well as focusing on growing its base of distributors and strengthening its relationship with builders and contractors. Some of you may have Trex products or probably know someone who does. I know that when my wooden deck reaches the end of its useful life, a Trex deck is going in its place. Of course, there are bears out there as with any stock claiming that it's "just a commodity" and that there is no "real moat." I would beg to differ as there certainly is some type of moat offered with Trex being recognized as the leading brand when it comes to wood-alternative decking and superior operational performance and I will be expanding on those topics in this article. Additionally, the market opportunity for Trex has barely been tapped and with market trends that favor the company's products, Trex deserves more careful consideration from investors. Strength in Brand Recognition The Trex brand is undoubtedly the most recognizable brand when it comes to wood-alternative decking material and with their most recent market studies from 2013 and 2015 showing that the company commands most of the majority of its market space with nearly 50% of consumers reporting that they have used or will use Trex, while the remaining is spread across 3 other competitors. Additionally, visits to the company webpage have grown YoY consistently, demonstrating the interest in the company's offerings. The next market study is set to be completed this summer, which will be a helpful insight to see if this trend continues growing at the same pace. 

 Source Growth Opportunity Another exciting metric is the amount of decking in North America that is still wood is at 84%. With 2.4 billion linear feet potentially up for grabs yet, there is an undeniable opportunity for a large amount of growth in the market. 

 Source Adding to the size of the opportunity, in 2016, millennials (such as myself) became the largest population segment in America. This is important because according to a survey conducted by Nielsen in 2015, we put more importance on environmental stewardship than prior generations. 75% of millennials are willing to pay more for products that are more sustainable and Trex is made from recycled wood and polyethylene plastic. Trex's image of being a green product is well-known having received an award from Home Depot (NYSE:HD) as "Environmental Vendor of the Year" for 2016 and has been rated as the " Greenest" decking product by Green Building Magazine. Cap this off with a housing market that is trending in the right direction and which has millennials as the largest segment of the group at 45% according to Ellie Mae (NYSEMKT:ELLI), Trex is poised to further its market share. The Moat I for one think that Trex does have a moat, and while it may not be as well-defined as Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) switching costs or Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) stickiness - one still exists. The first component of the moat is brand recognition. Trex has the advantage of a brand that is easily recognizable and this is an intangible asset. Much like people will pay more for a Tiffany's (NYSE:TIF) diamond than one from another jeweler, even though the diamonds may be same. The second component of Trex's moat is their cost advantages. It was noted in the Q1 conference call that earnings grew much more rapidly than sales and was due largely to lower raw material costs and other cost-saving initiatives coupled with a higher utilization and other operational efficiencies. This is reflected in the fact that while in FY 2016 sales increased from $120,800,000 to $131,676,000, EPS increased from $0.55 to $0.79. That's a 43.6% increase in EPS with only a 9.0% increase in sales. Going forward the changes in EPS could be much greater with the significant potential for growing sales as demonstrated earlier. I am sure someone will be quick to point out EPS being influenced by share buybacks. Sure, there were some share buybacks - while the 6.99% repurchased in 2016 is almost double that of 3.37%, it's only an increase of 3.62% and does not account for the large growth in EPS. The main driver was reducing the bottom line. Looking at a snapshot from the company's most recent investor presentation, we see that key metrics are moving in the right direction with net sales, adjusted gross margins, EBITDA and diluted EPS all trending up in Q1 and on a trailing twelve-month basis.

 Source Q1 Selloff - An Opportunity to Enter at a Discount After reporting Q1 results in which revenue increased 10% and EPS was up 20%, the market decided the valuation was too steep (or something else as I have not entirely figured out why) and sold off with share prices dropping about 13% over the days after the May 4th report. This is an example of the market being irrational at times, leaving some investors scratching their heads. While gross margin was up 120 basis points to 45%, SG&A expenses were up $2.7 million in relation to the company's strategy to continue growing the brand strength via marketing and development initiatives. Forward guidance provided indicated that Trex looks to grow sales approximately 10% in the second quarter with SG&A remaining flat compared to the Q2 of last year. If the guidance sticks another solid quarter is in store for Trex. Conclusion Given the current market's characteristics and the positioning of Trex, this is a company that can be held for the next 2-3 years while listening in on the quarterly calls to ensure the thesis remains intact. Should Trex's brand strength falter or its operational efficiencies erode, then my thesis will need to be re-examined. With a P/E roughly 27x, Trex is not terribly overvalued given its growth potential has a forward P/E of 21.29. While that may not be a bargain I think again, given the growth potential this company possesses it's not too lofty. If you're still on the fence, wait for another quarter and see what happens, and you could even wait for this year's survey results to see if they confirm my thesis. But, whether you buy or not, I would keep an eye on this stock's quarterly results to see how things pan out.

	WINCHESTER, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 4, 2017--Trex Company, Inc.
	(NYSE:TREX), the world’s number-one brand of decking and railing and
	leader in high-performance, low-maintenance outdoor living products,
	today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31,
	2017.



	First Quarter 2017 Results



	Net sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $144.8 million, 10% above
	the $131.7 million reported in last year’s first quarter. Gross margin
	was 45%, a 120 basis point expansion from the 43.8% reported in the
	first quarter of 2016. The Company reported net income of $27.9 million,
	or $0.95 per diluted share, increases of 18% and 20%, respectively. Last
	year’s first quarter net income of $23.7 million, or $0.79 per diluted
	share, have been adjusted to reflect our adoption of the new FASB
	standard related to deduction of stock compensation.


	“This was another strong quarter for Trex, with double-digit sales
	growth, favorable gross margin impacts and relatively stable SG&A as a
	percent of revenue, resulting in record revenues and earnings,”
	commented James E. Cline, President and Chief Executive Officer.


	“The Trex brand continues to gain substantial consumer and trade
	recognition leading to a record number of visits to our website and to
	recent industry awards, which again named Trex the leader in brand
	familiarity and design. Production efficiencies in the first quarter
	combined with continued focus on cost reduction initiatives including
	ongoing success with our revised procurement strategies and increased
	capacity utilization drove solid gross margin expansion. SG&A for the
	quarter totaled $23.3 million, an increase of $2.7 million to support
	strategic investments in new product development and branding.





















	Recent Recognitions




	Trex was recognized as the “Greenest Decking” brand in

	Green
	Builder Media’s 2017 Reader’s Choice Awards

	for the
	seventh consecutive year.


	Trex was honored with the “Best of Houzz” Design Award for the third
	consecutive year and designated as an official “Houzz Influencer.”


	The 2017 Builder Brand Use Study named Trex number one in Brand
	Familiarity, Brand Used Most and Brand Used in the Past Two Years for
	the composite decking category. This marked the 10

	th

	consecutive year that Trex earned top rankings in all three brand
	performance areas.


	Trex Signature aluminum railing was included in the Green Builder Hot
	50 Products list.




	Summary and Outlook




	“

	Industry analysts continue to project that the growth rate
	for wood-alternative decking and railing will outpace the overall
	market. With advancements in all-weather materials and furnishings that
	enable the outdoors to act as an extension of the home, we believe Trex,
	as the market leader in high-performance, wood-alternative decking,
	railing and accessories, is very well positioned to benefit from the
	projected increase in demand for functional outdoor living spaces.


	“In 2017, we will expand our successful marketing and advertising
	campaigns that emphasize the advantages of composite decking over
	traditional wood as well as the environmental benefits of our products.
	Continued market share gains and favorable gross margin impacts are
	expected to benefit full year 2017 results.


	“In the second quarter of 2017 we expect to achieve revenues of $160
	million. Our expectation for incremental gross margin is now expected to
	be in excess of 50% for full year 2017,” Mr. Cline concluded.



	First Quarter 2017 Conference Call and Webcast Information



	Trex will hold a conference call to discuss its first-quarter 2017

	within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
	Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are
	subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual
	operating results to differ materially. Such risks and uncertainties
	include the extent of market acceptance of the Company's products; the

	and Exchange Commission by the Company, including in particular its
	latest annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
	discuss some of the important factors that could cause the Company's

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
