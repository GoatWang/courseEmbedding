Outbound Contact Center









What is an outbound call center?
Outbound call centers dial out to reach customers or prospects, and are typically used when a sales team is prospecting for new customers.  Outbound call centers may utilize autodialer and predictive dialing solutions to help maximize agent productivity by increasing the amount of connections agents can make with customers.  
Accelerating Sales with Next-Generation Automatic Dialer Technology
Five9 automated dialing solutions offer you a range of customizable dialing modes to align with your call center needs. The advanced dialer algorithms can predict when an agent will become available and adjust call rates to ensure there is a new call waiting for them.
Agents don’t waste time dialing and waiting. The dialers automatically screen out unanswered calls, hang-ups, and leave voicemails. So agents spend more time talking to customers, and productivity skyrockets.













Predictive Dialer
The Predictive Dialer calculates the number of calls to dial based on connect rates, real-time data, and historical agent statistics.



Power Dialer
The Five9 Power Dialer continuously dials at a fixed number based on your desired calls-to-agent ratio—but only as reps are ready to take a call.



Progressive Dialer
Our Progressive Dialer provides a variable calls-to- agent ratio that determines how many calls the system needs to place as reps become available.





Preview Dialer
This dialing mode allows sales reps to review customer contact records prior to dialing. The amount of time to preview a call can be preset if desired.



TCPA Compliance
Safeguards prevent any automated dialing not in compliance with Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) regulations.


With Five9, we have literally been doubling our year-over-year growth.

Services









Let Us Help You Build Your Contact Center
With thousands of successful customer implementations, we know what it takes to build an excellent contact center. The Five9 approach to implementation is to first define a solution based on your business goals and success criteria, to configure that solution, to train your staff, to validate that the solution meets your business requirements, and to then deploy the solution throughout your organization. After deployment, we continuously fine-tune the solution to deliver optimal results.
Each project has a designated Implementation Manager from our Professional Services team to help you get up and running. This means that within 24 hours of your first “Getting Started” email, you will have a Five9 team member helping you every step of the way. During implementation, Five9 University trains your staff, supervisors, and administrators on the use of the Five9 system. After intial implementation, our Professional Services team is available to ensure the continued success of your contact center.

THE FIVE9 ADVANTAGE






                            Fast
                        

Our customers consistently tell us that the speed and ease of our deployments make us stand out from the competition. Your contact center can be up and running in days, not months, and you can easily scale as needed.

                            Easy
                        

                            Unlike complex on-premise contact centers, Five9 was created with the business user in mind. It’s easy enough to use that even non-techies can make changes, and intuitive enough that little-to-no training is required for your agents and supervisors.
                        








                            Affordable
                        

Our subscription model allows you to pay only for the agents you need, when you need them, and on a monthly basis. You no longer have to overbuy to accommodate for predictive maximum capacity or seasonal peaks.

                            The Five9 architecture is designed with firewalls, intrusion prevention, and a vulnerability management system to protect your data. The Five9 Cloud Security Office safeguards our infrastructure, applications, and operations against breaches and unforeseen events.
                        








                            Reliable
                        

                            Five9 successfully processes over 3 billion customer interactions a year for over 2,100 customers. To mitigate service disruption and maximize up-time, we offer redundant data centers geographically dispersed on opposite US coasts with failover capability.
                        














NOC Overview

The Five9 Network Operations Center (NOC) serves as the real-time monitoring and operations hub for the Five9 infrastructure and applications. Our NOC utilizes a 24-hour “follow the sun” strategy to continually monitor the volume and distribution of millions of interactions traveling through the Five9 cloud. As a result, potential service events are often mitigated before they occur, and unexpected events can be quickly resolved.

THE FIVE9 ADVANTAGE






                            Fast
                        

Our customers consistently tell us that the speed and ease of our deployments make us stand out from the competition. Your contact center can be up and running in days, not months, and you can easily scale as needed.

                            Easy
                        

                            Unlike complex on-premise contact centers, Five9 was created with the business user in mind. It’s easy enough to use that even non-techies can make changes, and intuitive enough that little-to-no training is required for your agents and supervisors.
                        








                            Affordable
                        

Our subscription model allows you to pay only for the agents you need, when you need them, and on a monthly basis. You no longer have to overbuy to accommodate for predictive maximum capacity or seasonal peaks.

                            Secure
                        

                            The Five9 architecture is designed with firewalls, intrusion prevention, and a vulnerability management system to protect your data. The Five9 Cloud Security Office safeguards our infrastructure, applications, and operations against breaches and unforeseen events.
                        








                            Reliable
                        

                            Five9 successfully processes over 3 billion customer interactions a year for over 2,100 customers. To mitigate service disruption and maximize up-time, we offer redundant data centers geographically dispersed on opposite US coasts with failover capability.
                        














NOC Overview

The Five9 Network Operations Center (NOC) serves as the real-time monitoring and operations hub for the Five9 infrastructure and applications. Our NOC utilizes a 24-hour “follow the sun” strategy to continually monitor the volume and distribution of millions of interactions traveling through the Five9 cloud. As a result, potential service events are often mitigated before they occur, and unexpected events can be quickly resolved.

How Five9 Business Communication Solutions Work

                    As a cloud solution, the Five9 Virtual Contact Center eliminates the hassle and expense of traditional on-premise contact center software. To use the Five9 software, all your agents need are a computer, a USB Headset, and a high-speed Internet connection.
