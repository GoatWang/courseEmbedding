over 29 years of experience, USFGi assists clients in verification of bond

in order to achieve success. 
USFGi works with their clients from concept to closing and beyond.

Since
the individuals within the firm have a long standing reputation of producing
innovative financing solutions, large investment firms have been very willing to
underwrite these innovative financings, and distribute the debt and equity
securities.
Most
recently, USFGi created and completed the first of its kind stepped coupon
structure in order to reduce the cost of negative arbitrage during the
construction period. 
This innovative approach saved USFGis client $70,000 of upfront costs. 
This approach has garnered nation acceptance and is being used by other
real estate financing firms.
