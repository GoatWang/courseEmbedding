                        Since Inception:

$2.3 billion of Equity Capital Invested

                        Snow Phipps is a private equity firm focused on mid-market control investments.
                    
                    The firm was co-founded by Ian Snow and Ogden Phipps in 2005 and utilizes an Operating
                    Partner strategy seeking to create long-term capital appreciation. Along with its
                    founders, Snow Phipps is led by three additional Investment Partners: Alan Mantel, Sundip Murthy and John Pless. The firm generally targets companies in attractive sectors or sub-sectors and then utilizes its Operating Partners and management teams to seek to raise these companies to higher levels of growth and performance.

                    investment opportunities and effectively work with management teams to execute our
                    shared strategic vision.
