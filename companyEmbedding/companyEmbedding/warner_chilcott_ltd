Weinberg Group > FDA News > Could Pharmaceutical “Product-Hopping” Violate Antitrust Laws? FTC Thinks So…











07 Oct 2015FDA News
Could Pharmaceutical “Product-Hopping” Violate Antitrust Laws? FTC Thinks So…


In the case between Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Warner Chilcott, in which Mylan accused Warner Chilcott of violating antitrust laws by participating in “product hopping”, the FTC has filed an amicus brief with the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
FTC states that by engaging in product-hopping, pharmaceutical companies could be harming consumers and impeding competition from potential “generic entrants, which have sought FDA approval to sell a generic version only of the original formulation but not the replacement.”
Background
In 2012, Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. accused Warner Chilcott PLC (now Allergan)and Mayne Pharma Group Ltd. of attempting to prevent/delay generic versions of its drug Doryx, indicated for the treatment of acne, from entering the market. Mylan claimed that they were doing this by making slight changes to the product every few years that had little to no consumer benefit.
The district court ruled in favor of Warner Chilcott, saying that a reasonable juror could not find evidence of Warner Chilcott having monopoly power. This ruling was made in accordance with what the court deemed ‘uncontradicted evidence’ of ‘the interchangeability of Doryx with other oral tetracyclines.’ The court went on to say that Mylan could have chosen to compete with Warner Chilcott in ways that did not involve automatic substitution, and the company could have used tactics such as marketing and advertising to promote its products.
Product Hopping & FTC’s Involvement
According to the FTC’s brief, there are numerous strategies used by brand-name drug companies to avoid competition and maintain high profits. One of these strategies is called ‘product hopping’ and refers to when “a brand name manufacturer makes minor changes to a drug and, to thwart generic substitution at pharmacies, takes calculated steps to damage the market for the original formulation before generic entry.” This practice violates the Sherman Antitrust Act, which was passed by Congress in 1890 to prohibit certain business activities that the federal government deems to be anti-competitive, and requires the federal government to investigate and pursue trusts.
The FTC states that:

“The district court’s analysis of the threshold monopoly-power question foundered on a basic misunderstanding of the special characteristics of the pharmaceutical marketplace.”

Although the FTC is not “siding” with Mylan in its brief, it does believe that the judge made a mistake in granting judgement to Warner Chilcott. The brief states that generic drugs are a unique source of competition for the branded pharmaceutical products, and “without automatic substitution, the disconnect between prescribing physicians and payors often insulates brand-name prescription drugs from effective price competition, and a given drug may be priced at monopoly levels even if other drugs are therapeutically similar.”
Additionally, FTC feel that product-hopping on its own, can be evidence of monopoly power and that manufacturers typically make these “hops” in order to “preserve high profits that generic versions of the same drug would undercut but that no alternative drug, competing in the same market, has yet disciplined.”

“The district court also erred in its analysis of exclusionary conduct.”

According to the Sherman Act, a “monopolist’s” conduct is unlawful if the company increases rivals’ costs due to deprivation of their most efficient distribution mechanisms. This causes a domino effect and, in turn, harms consumers by damaging the competitive ability its rivals to have an effect on monopoly prices.
The FTC also said the court “was wrong to dismiss automatic substitution as a mere ‘regulatory windfall’ undeserving of antitrust protection.”
FTC concludes the brief with the statement that “the Court should reverse and remand for further proceedings.”

Mylan Won't Appeal 3rd Circ. Loss On Doryx Generic 
Generic-drug maker Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. won&rsquo;t be appealing the Third Circuit&rsquo;s decision affirming a Pennsylvania federal court&rsquo;s dismissal of the company's antitrust suit alleging Warner Chilcott restrained competition for acne medication Doryx, as the deadline for petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court has passed.


November 30, 2016
3rd Circ. Won't Rethink Mylan's Doryx Product-Hopping Loss

FTC, Antitrust Org Ask 3rd Circ. To Rethink Doryx Decision
The Federal Trade Commission and American Antitrust Institute on Wednesday each asked the Third Circuit to rethink its dismissal of Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s product-hopping suit against Warner Chilcott Ltd. over the acne medication Doryx, arguing the court changed the Sherman Act&rsquo;s standard of harm and misinterpreted an array of precedent.&nbsp;


October 17, 2016
3rd Circ. Got Doryx Product-Hopping Suit Wrong, Mylan Says
Mylan on Friday asked for the Third Circuit to reconsider a September decision affirming a dismissal of its antitrust suit against Warner Chilcott over acne medication Doryx, saying if the holding is allowed to stand, it could provide a safe harbor for pharmaceutical companies to engage in product hopping.


September 28, 2016
Mylan Antitrust Suit Over Acne Drug Rejected By 3rd Circ.
The Third Circuit on Wednesday affirmed a Pennsylvania federal court&rsquo;s dismissal of Mylan&rsquo;s antitrust suit over the acne medication Doryx, finding that the generics maker failed to establish that Warner Chilcott and Mayne had sufficient market power in the relevant market.


June 29, 2016
3rd Circ. Wants Arguments Limited To Market In Doryx Row
The Third Circuit on Tuesday told counsel for Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Warner Chilcott PLC and Mayne Pharma Group Ltd. that their oral arguments next month in an antitrust case over the acne medication Doryx should be limited to defining a market and proving or disputing anticompetitive conduct.

March 17, 2016
Mylan Slams Warner's 'Overheated Rhetoric' In Doryx Row
Allowing Warner Chilcott to file a surreply in Mylan&rsquo;s suit accusing it of blocking generics for the acne medication Doryx by tweaking its formula would only delay Mylan&rsquo;s appeal of its district court loss without helping further the case, the generic drugmaker has told the Third Circuit.


March  2, 2016
Mylan Accused Of 'Whopping Misstatements' In Doryx Row
Warner Chilcott PLC on Wednesday ripped Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.&rsquo;s bid to revive a suit accusing Warner of tweaking the formula of its acne medication Doryx in order to block generic competition, saying a recent brief Mylan filed with the Third Circuit contains &ldquo;whopping misstatements&rdquo; and unfounded accusations.
