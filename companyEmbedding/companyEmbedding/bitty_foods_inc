Apple Persimmon Cranberry Cobbler — Bitty Foods


















































Apple Persimmon Cranberry Cobbler







TIME: 1HRSERVINGS: 12INGREDIENTSFilling2 large granny smith apples, peeled and cut into 1/2” dice 1 large fuyu persimmon, cut into 1/2” dice2/3c cranberries (cooks down to about 1/3c)3/4c water 1/3c sugar3T sugar (1T for cranberry cooking)3T butterZest of 1/2 lemonCrumble1/4c + 1T Bitty flour1/4c + 1T almond meal1/4c +2T roasted chopped almonds1/4c +2T roasted chopped filberts1/4c +2T softened butter1/2t cinnamon1T organic cane sugarDIRECTIONSPreheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place cranberries, water and 1/3c sugar into a saucepot and bring to a boil.  Allow cranberries to cook until they’ve softened. Meanwhile use 1T of butter to butter your cobbler dish (ours was an ovular 5x9”).  Strain cranberries over a bowl, reserving 1T of cooking liquid. Add apples, persimmon and 1/3c of cranberry and 1T cooking liquid to a mixing bowl, along with 3T sugar and lemon zest.  Mix together until evenly incorporated and pour into your cobbler dish, distributing evenly to the edges.  Dollop the top of the mixture with the remaining 2T of butter. For the crumble, add all of your ingredients into a bowl and squish them together with your hands until they’re all sticking together.Evenly top the filling with the crumble, and bake at 350 for about 40 minutes, or until the crumb topping turns a bit golden brown. (If you substitute butter for coconut oil, those fats don't brown, so pull if after 40 minutes). Allow to cool slightly before serving.
