 What Caused Michael Jackson's Sudden Death? 








Michael Jackson, the "King of Pop" died on June 25, 2009 at age 50. His death was sudden and unexpected, leaving many grieving fans wondering what happened. How did he die?
The Call
"HE'S NOT RESPONDING"
An unidentified man called 911 from Jackson's California mansion at 12:21 p.m. He reported that Jackson was unconscious and not breathing. In excerpts from the call, the man said that Jackson's personal doctor was the only other person present and was performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the unconscious Jackson without results. "He's pumping, he's pumping his chest but he's not responding to anything, sir, please," the caller said. The caller is still unidentified.
Jackson was rushed to the hospital by paramedics shortly after the call. He was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm.
The Autopsy
An autopsy was done the very next day. The doctors, however, said they couldn't immediately establish a cause of death. Los Angeles County Coroner's spokesman Craig Harvey reported that, "the cause of death has been deferred; the medical examiner has ordered additional testing such as toxicology and other studies." Toxicology tests would show if Jackson was taking drugs when he died. This means that it could take 4-6 more weeks until there is an official cause of death. In the meantime, speculation is rising.
The Rumors
After the autopsy, foul play and external trauma were ruled out. That leaves behind a theory that it was medication that caused Jackson to suffer a heart attack.
A heart attack is a blocking of the arteries that deprives the heart of adequate blood and can cause cardiac arrest. However, cardiac arrest can also be caused by factors other than a heart attack, including medications. Jackson's brother Jermaine said it was believed that Jackson went into cardiac arrest due to an interruption of the normal heartbeat.
The Medications
Demerol
It has been reported that Jackson's personal doctor injected Jackson with Demerol about half an hour before he went into cardiac arrest. Demerol is a strong narcotic painkiller and carries a long list of warnings to users. The government warns that mixing it with certain other drugs can lead to reactions including slowed or stopped breathing, shock and cardiac arrest. Jackson's death may have been caused by an overdose of the drug.
Other Drugs
It is possible that Jackson was "heavily addicted" to the painkiller Oxycontin and was injected daily with that medication, along with Demerol. Brian Oxman, Jackson's family spokesman and lawyer, told reporters that he had been concerned about the prescription drugs Jackson took for pain he had. He commented to reporters: "I said one day, we're going to have this experience, and when Anna Nicole Smith passed away, I said we cannot have this kind of thing with Michael Jackson. I do not want to point fingers at anyone because I want to hear what the toxicology report says and the coroner says. But the plain fact of the matter is that Michael Jackson had prescription drugs at his disposal at all times."
The Associated Press reported that in 2007 Jackson settled a lawsuit filed by a Beverly Hills pharmacy that claimed he owed more than $100,000 for prescription drugs over a two-year period.
Signs of Ill-Health
Back in 2005, when Jackson was on trial for child molestation charges, he appeared to be in bad health. His trial was interrupted several times by hospital visits. He even once appeared late to court dressed in his pajamas after an emergency room visit. Also during the trial, the prosecution confiscated several items from his home, including syringes, Demerol and other prescription drugs.
Jackson himself admitted that he first got hooked on pain medication when filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984 where special effects exploded and burned his scalp. In 1993, in a recorded statement, he said that the child molestation allegations against him contributed to his continuing drug use. "I became increasingly more dependent to the painkillers to get me through the days of the tour," he said. "My friends and doctors advised me to seek professional guidance immediately in order to eliminate what has become an addiction."
The Physical
Jackson was about to launch a huge international tour in the upcoming months and has begun rehearsing. For insurance purposes, promoters of the tour required that Jackson undergo a health physical. In February or March, Jackson passed a 4 ½-hour physical examination with independent doctors and was believed to be in good health.
Where Is the Doctor?
Conrad Robert Murray, Jackson's personal live-in doctor was at the scene when the 911 phone call was placed. When the 911 dispatcher asked the caller whether anyone witnessed what happened, the caller said: "No, just the doctor, sir, the doctor's been the only one here." After the death, the Los Angeles Police Department impounded the doctor's car to search for medications and other evidence. The Los Angele Police wanted to question the doctor; however, he was unable to be located immediately after Jackson's death. While not yet a criminal suspect, the doctor has hired lawyers and is being questioned by investigators.
What Happens Now?
The Cancelled Shows
AEG Live held multiple insurance policies covering cancellation of the shows. Randy Phillips, president of AEG Live commented: "We had pretty good coverage, but a lot of it is going to depend on the toxicology results. We need to know what the cause of death was."
What Can you Learn from this?
Drug Interactions
While the official cause of death is still unknown, many believe that medications were the cause. Jackson was taking several strong medications. An overdose of a prescription drug can be fatal. Also, mixing several drugs can be very dangerous. If you are taking several medications, ask your doctor about possible dangerous interactions.
The US Food and Drug Administration has several dangerous drug interactions on its Web site.
Possible Lawsuits
Until there is an official cause of death, we can't point fingers at anyone. However, there is a possibility that in the future, the family will try to bring a wrongful death lawsuit or a malpractice claim against Jackson's personal doctor if the Demerol injection did in fact cause his cardiac arrest.
Malpractice
For a medical malpractice case, Jackson's family must present expert medical testimony showing that that no reasonable health care provider would have done what his did. That could be showing that the doctor was over-prescribing several medications and a reasonable professional doctor would not have done so. The family will have to show that it was the negligence of the doctor that caused Jackson's death.
Wrongful Death
Jackson's family may be able to bring a wrongful death lawsuit based on negligence of Jackson's personal doctor. A wrongful death action is a lawsuit brought by the relatives of a person who died as a result of a wrongful act to bring compensation for the survivors who have been injured by the absence of the person who died.
In the meanwhile, we'll all have to wait and see what the official report says.

Mini Bio (1)


          Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana on August 29, 1958, and entertained audiences nearly his entire life. His father, Joe Jackson, had been a guitarist, but was forced to give up his musical ambitions following his marriage to Katherine Jackson (née Katherine Esther Scruse). Together, they prodded their growing family's musical interests at home. By the early 1960s, the older boys Jackie, Tito and Jermaine had begun performing around the city; by 1964, Michael and Marlon had joined in.A musical prodigy, Michael's singing and dancing talents were amazingly mature, and he soon became the dominant voice and focus of the Jackson 5. An opening act for such soul groups as the O-Jays and James Brown, it was Gladys Knight (not Diana Ross) who officially brought the group to Berry Gordy's attention, and by 1969, the boys were producing back-to-back chart-busting hits as Motown artists ("I Want You Back," "ABC," "Never Can Say Goodbye," "Got to Be There," etc.). As a product of the 1970s, the boys emerged as one of the most accomplished black pop / soul vocal groups in music history, successfully evolving from a group like The Temptations to a disco phenomenon.Solo success for Michael was inevitable, and by the 1980s, he had become infinitely more popular than his brotherly group. Record sales consistently orbited, culminating in the biggest-selling album of all time, "Thriller" in 1982. A TV natural, he ventured rather uneasily into films, such as playing the Scarecrow in The Wiz (1978), but had much better luck with elaborate music videos.In the 1990s, the downside as an 1980s pop phenomenon began to rear itself. Michael grew terribly child-like and introverted by his peerless celebrity. A rather timorous, androgynous figure to begin with, his physical appearance began to change drastically, and his behavior grew alarmingly bizarre, making him a consistent target for scandal-making, despite his numerous charitable acts. Two brief marriages -- one to Elvis Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley -- were forged and two children produced by his second wife during that time, but the purposes behind them appeared image-oriented. Despite it all, Jackson's passion and artistry as a singer, dancer, writer and businessman are unparalleled, and it is these prodigious talents that will ultimately prevail over the extremely negative aspects of his seriously troubled adult life.

Trivia (172)

      Through his "Heal the World" Foundation, Jackson spearheaded airlifts of food and medical supplies to war-torn Sarajevo, instituted mentoring, immunization and drug-abuse education programs and paid for a Hungarian child's liver transplant.


      On 3 April 1998, his second child, with Debbie Rowe, daughter Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, is born.


      13 February 1997, his wife, Debbie Rowe, gave birth to a son, named Prince Michael (Michael Joseph Jackson Jr.), in Beverly Hills, California.


Macaulay Culkin is godfather to his three children.


      On 26 May 1994, he married Lisa Marie Presley in La Vega, Dominican Republic, by Judge Hugo Francisco Alvarez Perez. Witnesses present were Thomas Keough and Eve Darling (Lisa Marie's ex-brother-in-law and his wife, ex-sister-in-law).


      He shares with Carlos Santana the record for most Grammys won in one year, with eight.


      He was the first solo artist to generate four top ten hits on the Billboard charts on one album with "Off the Wall.".


      He was the first artist to generate seven top ten hits (USA) on one album with "Thriller.".


      Until August 2011, he was the only artist in history to generate five #1 hits (USA) from one album with "Bad". Katy Perry has since tied this record with her album "Teenage Dream".


      With Lionel Richie, he co-wrote the song "We Are the World," and was one of its performers.


      His 1982 album "Thriller" is the biggest selling album of all time, with confirmed sales of over 51 million, and claimed sales of over 100 million copies worldwide. His 1987 album "BAD" is one of the biggest selling albums of all time, with over 20 million copies sold worldwide. His 1991 album "Dangerous" is one of the biggest selling albums of all time, with over 20 million copies sold worldwide.


      He was the brother of (in this order) Rebbie Jackson, Jackie Jackson, Tito Jackson, Jermaine Jackson, La Toya Jackson, Marlon Jackson, Randy Jackson and Janet Jackson.


      He copied his moon walk after mime Marcel Marceau in "walk-against-the- wind" pantomime techniques.


      He wrote and recorded a song called "On the Line", produced by Kenneth 'Babyface' Edmonds, for the film Get on the Bus (1996) that was not included on the soundtrack for the film.

      In a move named by Jackson's advisers as "refinancing," it was announced in April 2006 that Jackson had struck a deal with Sony and Fortress investments. In the deal Sony may be allowed to take control of half of Jackson's 50% stake in Sony/ ATV Music Publishing (worth an estimated $1 billion) which Jackson co-owns. Jackson would be left with 25% of the catalog, with the rest belonging to Sony. In exchange, Sony negotiated with a loans company on behalf of Jackson.

Jackson failed to pay and the Bank of America sold them to Fortress investments, a company dealing in distressed loans. However, Jackson hasn't as yet sold any of the remainder of his stake. The possible purchase by Sony of 25% of Sony/ATV Music Publishing is a conditional option; it is assumed the singer will try to avoid having to sell part of the catalog of songs including material by other artists such as 'Bob Dylan' and Destiny's Child.

      Jackson hired film director Martin Scorsese to direct the video for the "Bad" album's title track. When the 18-minute music video debuted on television, it sparked a great deal of controversy as it was apparent that Jackson's appearance had changed dramatically. Although Jackson's skin color had been a medium- brown color for the entire duration of his youth, his skin had gradually become paler since 1982, and had now become a light brown color.

      It has been implied that much of his self-described Peter Pan persona as an eccentric and somewhat childlike man was created and imposed by his managers. Wesley Snipes, who got to know him while making the ''Bad'' music video, was surprised at his ability to hold long and detailed conversations about topics such as psychology, metaphysics and social issues.

Personal Quotes (48)

      I can't think of a better way to spread the message of world peace than by working with the NFL and being part of Super Bowl XXVII.


      I don't like pop music.


      I'll always be Peter Pan in my heart.


      People think they know me, but they don't. Not really. Actually, I am one of the loneliest people on this earth. I cry sometimes, because it hurts. It does. To be honest, I guess you could say that it hurts to be me.


      "Just because you read it in a magazine or see it on a TV screen doesn't make it factual. To buy it is to feed it." - about tabloid magazines.


      I made a terrible mistake. I got caught up in the excitement of the moment. I would never intentionally endanger the lives of my children.


      "You ain't seen nothing yet, and the best is yet to come." (1999)


      There is a lot of sadness in my past life. My father beat me. It was difficult to take being beaten and then going on stage. He was strict; very hard and stern.


Elizabeth Taylor used to feed me, to hand-feed me, at times. Please, I don't want anybody to think I'm starving, I'm not. My health is perfect, actually.


      I just want to say to fans in every corner of the earth, every nationality, every race, every language: I love you from the bottom of my heart. I would love your prayers and your goodwill, and please be patient and be with me and believe in me because I am completely, completely innocent. But please know a lot of conspiracy is going on as we speak.


Marlon Brando has been pushing. He's a wonderful man. He's a god. He wants a lot of money. He wants to get things done right now. - On a video about acting which he was planning to make with Brando in 2001


Elizabeth Taylor is a warm cuddly blanket that I love to snuggle up to and cover myself with. I can confide in her and trust her. She's Mother Teresa, Princess Diana, the Queen of England, and Wendy.


      I trusted Martin Bashir to come into my life and that of my family because I wanted the truth to be told. Martin Bashir persuaded me to trust him that his would be an honest and fair portrayal of my life and told me that he was the man that turned Diana's life around. I am surprised that a professional journalist would compromise his integrity by deceiving me in this way. Today I feel more betrayed than perhaps ever before; that someone, who had got to know my children, my staff and me, whom I let into my heart and told the truth, could then sacrifice the trust I placed in him and produce this terrible and unfair programme. Everyone who knows me will know the truth which is that my children come first in my life and that I would never harm any child. I also want to thank my fans around the world for the overwhelming number of messages of support that I have received, particularly from Great Britain, where people have e-mailed me and said how appalled they were by the Bashir film. Their love and support has touched me greatly.


      I was coming out of the shower and I fell and all my body weight - I'm pretty fragile - all my body weight fell against my rib cage. And I bruised my lung very badly.


      I love my children. I was holding my son tight. Why would I throw a baby off the balcony? That's the dumbest, stupidest story I ever heard.


      I think that it's demeaning and disrespectful but I also want to make it clear it's not just about me but a pattern of disrespect that he has shown to our community. He needs to stop it and he needs to stop it now. - On Eminem's video for "Just Lose It


      I have spent my entire life helping millions of children across the world. I would never harm a child. It is unfortunate that some individuals have seen fit to come forward and make a complaint that is completely false. Years ago, I settled with certain individuals because I was concerned about my family and the media scrutiny that would have ensued if I fought the matter in court. These people wanted to exploit my concern for children by threatening to destroy what I believe in and what I do. I have been a vulnerable target for those who want money.


      I am always writing a potpourri of music. I want to give the world escapism through the wonder of great music and to reach the masses.


      I'm a visionary and a creative person. God blessed me with certain talents. I hate to use an analogy, but Walt Disney was creative but not good with business. His brother Roy handled the books. He loved creating family-oriented entertainment and so do I. I feel that was a gift and I have that gift also. I'm very honored to have been chosen.


      "When I saw him move I was mesmerized. I've never seen a performer perform like James Brown and right then and there I knew that that was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.


      Success definitely brings on loneliness. People think you're lucky, that you have everything. They think you can go anywhere and do anything, but that's not the point. One hungers for the basic stuff.


      My father was a management genius. But what I really wanted was a dad.


      I've been in the entertainment industry since I was six-years-old ... As Charles Dickens says, 'It's been the best of times, the worst of times.' But I would not change my career ... While some have made deliberate attempts to hurt me, I take it in stride because I have a loving family, a strong faith and wonderful friends and fans who have, and continue, to support me. (2007)


      [on his career] It all went by so fast, didn't it? I wish I could do it all over again, I really do.


      [on refuting persistent rumors of skin surgery or bleaching] If I had a chance to talk to Michelangelo, I would ask him what inspired him to become who he is, the anatomy of his craftsmanship, not about who he dated last night or why he decided to sit out in the sun so long.


      When I was 16, we were doing Las Vegas every night, and Elvis Presley and Sammy Davis Jr. would sit me and my brothers in a row and lecture us. 'Don't ever do drugs,' they told us. I never forgot it.


      Music has been my outlet, my gift to all of the lovers in this world. Through it, my music, I know I will live forever.


      You have to have that tragedy, that pain to pull from. That's what makes a clown great. You can see he's hurting behind the masquerade. He's something else externally. Charles Chaplin did that so beautifully, better than anyone. I can play off those moments, too. I've been through the fire many times.


      I never had the chance to do the fun things kids do: sleepovers, parties, trick-or-treat. There was no Christmas, no holiday celebrating. So now you try to compensate for some of that loss.


      My father is a much nicer person now. I think he realizes his children are everything. Without your family, you have nothing. He's a nice human being. At one time, we'd be horrified if he just showed up. We were scared to death. He turned out really well. I wish it wasn't so late.


      I'm still fascinated by clouds and the sunset. I was making wishes on the rainbow yesterday. I saw the meteor shower. I made a wish every time I saw a shooting star.


      I have confidence in my abilities. I have real perseverance. Nothing can stop me when I put my mind to it.


      I never think about themes. I let the music create itself. I like it to be a potpourri of all kinds of sounds, all kinds of colors, something for everybody, from the farmer in Ireland to the lady who scrubs toilets in Harlem.


      I've had people come to me, and after meeting me, they start crying. I say, "Why are you crying?" They say, "Because I thought you would be stuck up, but you're the nicest person." I say, "Who gave you this judgment?" They tell me they read it. I tell them, "Don't you believe what you read."


      When I'm on stage, it's like a two-hour marathon. I weigh myself before and after each show, and I lose a good 10 pounds. Sweat is all over the stage. Then you get to your hotel and your adrenaline is at its zenith and you can't fall asleep. And you've got a show the next day. It's tough.


      [on calling himself the 'King of Pop'] I never self-proclaimed myself to be anything. If I called up Elizabeth Taylor right now, she would tell you that she coined the phrase. She was introducing me, I think at the American Music Awards, and said in her own words - it wasn't in the script - "I'm a personal fan, and in my opinion he is the king of pop, rock and soul." Then the press started saying "King of Pop" and the fans started. This self-proclaimed garbage, I don't know who said that.


      I sit in my room at home and sometimes cry. It's so hard to make friends. Sometimes I walk around the neighbourhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home.


      [on being asked what he thought his funeral would be like in 2002] It's going to be the greatest show on Earth. That's what I want. Fireworks and everything.


      [on recording in Ireland in 2006] I've never given up on making music. Ireland has inspired me to make a great new album.


      If you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same, then everything that happens in between can be dealt with.


      I am the captain of my ship. I take suggestions and listen to what everyone has to say, but the final decision is mine.


      [on his father] He is a very jealous father. He isn't gonna show you love, but anybody that gets closer to us than him he would tell them, 'Leave my boys alone!' To tell you the truth, I never have felt close to him. He has always been like a mystery man.


      I would like some way to disappear where people don't see me anymore at some point. I don't want to grow old. I never want to look in the mirror and see that.


      The greatest education in the world is watching the masters at work.


      In a world filled with hate, we must still dare to hope. In a world filled with anger, we must still dare to comfort. In a world filled with despair, we must still dare to dream. And in a world filled with distrust, we must still dare to believe.


      Why can't you share your bed? The most loving thing you can do is share your bed with someone. It's very charming. It's very sweet. It's what the whole world should do.


      A star can never die. It just turns into a smile and melts back into the cosmic music, the dance of life.


      [the three most important rules for any aspiring pop star] Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.

Mini Bio (1)


          Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana on August 29, 1958, and entertained audiences nearly his entire life. His father, Joe Jackson, had been a guitarist, but was forced to give up his musical ambitions following his marriage to Katherine Jackson (née Katherine Esther Scruse). Together, they prodded their growing family's musical interests at home. By the early 1960s, the older boys Jackie, Tito and Jermaine had begun performing around the city; by 1964, Michael and Marlon had joined in.A musical prodigy, Michael's singing and dancing talents were amazingly mature, and he soon became the dominant voice and focus of the Jackson 5. An opening act for such soul groups as the O-Jays and James Brown, it was Gladys Knight (not Diana Ross) who officially brought the group to Berry Gordy's attention, and by 1969, the boys were producing back-to-back chart-busting hits as Motown artists ("I Want You Back," "ABC," "Never Can Say Goodbye," "Got to Be There," etc.). As a product of the 1970s, the boys emerged as one of the most accomplished black pop / soul vocal groups in music history, successfully evolving from a group like The Temptations to a disco phenomenon.Solo success for Michael was inevitable, and by the 1980s, he had become infinitely more popular than his brotherly group. Record sales consistently orbited, culminating in the biggest-selling album of all time, "Thriller" in 1982. A TV natural, he ventured rather uneasily into films, such as playing the Scarecrow in The Wiz (1978), but had much better luck with elaborate music videos.In the 1990s, the downside as an 1980s pop phenomenon began to rear itself. Michael grew terribly child-like and introverted by his peerless celebrity. A rather timorous, androgynous figure to begin with, his physical appearance began to change drastically, and his behavior grew alarmingly bizarre, making him a consistent target for scandal-making, despite his numerous charitable acts. Two brief marriages -- one to Elvis Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley -- were forged and two children produced by his second wife during that time, but the purposes behind them appeared image-oriented. Despite it all, Jackson's passion and artistry as a singer, dancer, writer and businessman are unparalleled, and it is these prodigious talents that will ultimately prevail over the extremely negative aspects of his seriously troubled adult life.

Trivia (172)

      Through his "Heal the World" Foundation, Jackson spearheaded airlifts of food and medical supplies to war-torn Sarajevo, instituted mentoring, immunization and drug-abuse education programs and paid for a Hungarian child's liver transplant.


      On 3 April 1998, his second child, with Debbie Rowe, daughter Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, is born.


      13 February 1997, his wife, Debbie Rowe, gave birth to a son, named Prince Michael (Michael Joseph Jackson Jr.), in Beverly Hills, California.


Macaulay Culkin is godfather to his three children.


      On 26 May 1994, he married Lisa Marie Presley in La Vega, Dominican Republic, by Judge Hugo Francisco Alvarez Perez. Witnesses present were Thomas Keough and Eve Darling (Lisa Marie's ex-brother-in-law and his wife, ex-sister-in-law).


      He shares with Carlos Santana the record for most Grammys won in one year, with eight.


      He was the first solo artist to generate four top ten hits on the Billboard charts on one album with "Off the Wall.".


      He was the first artist to generate seven top ten hits (USA) on one album with "Thriller.".


      Until August 2011, he was the only artist in history to generate five #1 hits (USA) from one album with "Bad". Katy Perry has since tied this record with her album "Teenage Dream".


      With Lionel Richie, he co-wrote the song "We Are the World," and was one of its performers.


      His 1982 album "Thriller" is the biggest selling album of all time, with confirmed sales of over 51 million, and claimed sales of over 100 million copies worldwide. His 1987 album "BAD" is one of the biggest selling albums of all time, with over 20 million copies sold worldwide. His 1991 album "Dangerous" is one of the biggest selling albums of all time, with over 20 million copies sold worldwide.


      He was the brother of (in this order) Rebbie Jackson, Jackie Jackson, Tito Jackson, Jermaine Jackson, La Toya Jackson, Marlon Jackson, Randy Jackson and Janet Jackson.


      He copied his moon walk after mime Marcel Marceau in "walk-against-the- wind" pantomime techniques.


      He wrote and recorded a song called "On the Line", produced by Kenneth 'Babyface' Edmonds, for the film Get on the Bus (1996) that was not included on the soundtrack for the film.


      The name of his 2700-acre ranch near Santa Ynez, California, is Neverland Valley Ranch. It contains Jackson's house, an amusement park co-designed by Macaulay Culkin, a private theater and dance stage, and exotic animals.


      On 9 September 2001, he was sued by two former financial advisors for $25 million over alleged unpaid expenses. Jackson denied owing them anything.


      He had a skin disease called vitiligo.


      He was a Jehovah's Witness.


      He was uncle of Jermaine Jackson II, Valencia Jackson, Brittany Jackson, Marlon Jackson Jr., Stevanna Jackson.


      His estate contains a child's mini coaster, Zipper, Bumper cars, Merry go round, octopus, Giant slide and rocking dragon.. There is also a full size basketball court, water wars section (for water gun fights) 2 Trains, (one steam train) and a zoo where he has various exotic animals including elephants, giraffes, alligators, a tiger and even an Anaconda.


      He did not own the right to the entire catalog of The Beatles. For example, the family of the late George Harrison own songs he wrote, including "Something," and Sony music owns 50% of the catalog after Jackson sold it to them because he needed the money.


      He was the son of Katherine Jackson, and Joe Jackson.


      He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 as a member of the Jackson 5 and in 2001 as a solo artist.

      In a move named by Jackson's advisers as "refinancing," it was announced in April 2006 that Jackson had struck a deal with Sony and Fortress investments. In the deal Sony may be allowed to take control of half of Jackson's 50% stake in Sony/ ATV Music Publishing (worth an estimated $1 billion) which Jackson co-owns. Jackson would be left with 25% of the catalog, with the rest belonging to Sony. In exchange, Sony negotiated with a loans company on behalf of Jackson.

Jackson failed to pay and the Bank of America sold them to Fortress investments, a company dealing in distressed loans. However, Jackson hasn't as yet sold any of the remainder of his stake. The possible purchase by Sony of 25% of Sony/ATV Music Publishing is a conditional option; it is assumed the singer will try to avoid having to sell part of the catalog of songs including material by other artists such as 'Bob Dylan' and Destiny's Child.

      Jackson hired film director Martin Scorsese to direct the video for the "Bad" album's title track. When the 18-minute music video debuted on television, it sparked a great deal of controversy as it was apparent that Jackson's appearance had changed dramatically. Although Jackson's skin color had been a medium- brown color for the entire duration of his youth, his skin had gradually become paler since 1982, and had now become a light brown color.

      He was widely known to be a very private man. In one of his videos "Leave Me Alone," the video talked about negative and false stories about him after "Thriller.".


      He was portrayed in Quantum Leap: Camikazi Kid - June 6, 1961 (1989) as a child being taught by Scott Bakula's character how to moonwalk.


      He was close friends with Diana Ross, Berry Gordy, Smokey Robinson, Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Freddie Mercury, Elizabeth Taylor, Liza Minnelli, Marlon Brando, and Carrie Fisher.


      According to several media outlets, the high-pitched speaking voice Jackson usually used in public was actually a put-on, and his normal speaking voice was much deeper. Jackson biographer Ian Halperin claimed, "He wanted to act like a boy. He felt it was a way for the public to love him more".


Personal Quotes (48)

      I can't think of a better way to spread the message of world peace than by working with the NFL and being part of Super Bowl XXVII.


      I don't like pop music.


      I'll always be Peter Pan in my heart.


      People think they know me, but they don't. Not really. Actually, I am one of the loneliest people on this earth. I cry sometimes, because it hurts. It does. To be honest, I guess you could say that it hurts to be me.


      "Just because you read it in a magazine or see it on a TV screen doesn't make it factual. To buy it is to feed it." - about tabloid magazines.


      I made a terrible mistake. I got caught up in the excitement of the moment. I would never intentionally endanger the lives of my children.


      "You ain't seen nothing yet, and the best is yet to come." (1999)


      There is a lot of sadness in my past life. My father beat me. It was difficult to take being beaten and then going on stage. He was strict; very hard and stern.


Elizabeth Taylor used to feed me, to hand-feed me, at times. Please, I don't want anybody to think I'm starving, I'm not. My health is perfect, actually.


      I just want to say to fans in every corner of the earth, every nationality, every race, every language: I love you from the bottom of my heart. I would love your prayers and your goodwill, and please be patient and be with me and believe in me because I am completely, completely innocent. But please know a lot of conspiracy is going on as we speak.


Marlon Brando has been pushing. He's a wonderful man. He's a god. He wants a lot of money. He wants to get things done right now. - On a video about acting which he was planning to make with Brando in 2001


Elizabeth Taylor is a warm cuddly blanket that I love to snuggle up to and cover myself with. I can confide in her and trust her. She's Mother Teresa, Princess Diana, the Queen of England, and Wendy.


      I trusted Martin Bashir to come into my life and that of my family because I wanted the truth to be told. Martin Bashir persuaded me to trust him that his would be an honest and fair portrayal of my life and told me that he was the man that turned Diana's life around. I am surprised that a professional journalist would compromise his integrity by deceiving me in this way. Today I feel more betrayed than perhaps ever before; that someone, who had got to know my children, my staff and me, whom I let into my heart and told the truth, could then sacrifice the trust I placed in him and produce this terrible and unfair programme. Everyone who knows me will know the truth which is that my children come first in my life and that I would never harm any child. I also want to thank my fans around the world for the overwhelming number of messages of support that I have received, particularly from Great Britain, where people have e-mailed me and said how appalled they were by the Bashir film. Their love and support has touched me greatly.


      I was coming out of the shower and I fell and all my body weight - I'm pretty fragile - all my body weight fell against my rib cage. And I bruised my lung very badly.


      I love my children. I was holding my son tight. Why would I throw a baby off the balcony? That's the dumbest, stupidest story I ever heard.


      I think that it's demeaning and disrespectful but I also want to make it clear it's not just about me but a pattern of disrespect that he has shown to our community. He needs to stop it and he needs to stop it now. - On Eminem's video for "Just Lose It


      I have spent my entire life helping millions of children across the world. I would never harm a child. It is unfortunate that some individuals have seen fit to come forward and make a complaint that is completely false. Years ago, I settled with certain individuals because I was concerned about my family and the media scrutiny that would have ensued if I fought the matter in court. These people wanted to exploit my concern for children by threatening to destroy what I believe in and what I do. I have been a vulnerable target for those who want money.


      I am always writing a potpourri of music. I want to give the world escapism through the wonder of great music and to reach the masses.


      I'm a visionary and a creative person. God blessed me with certain talents. I hate to use an analogy, but Walt Disney was creative but not good with business. His brother Roy handled the books. He loved creating family-oriented entertainment and so do I. I feel that was a gift and I have that gift also. I'm very honored to have been chosen.


      "When I saw him move I was mesmerized. I've never seen a performer perform like James Brown and right then and there I knew that that was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.


      Success definitely brings on loneliness. People think you're lucky, that you have everything. They think you can go anywhere and do anything, but that's not the point. One hungers for the basic stuff.


      My father was a management genius. But what I really wanted was a dad.


      I've been in the entertainment industry since I was six-years-old ... As Charles Dickens says, 'It's been the best of times, the worst of times.' But I would not change my career ... While some have made deliberate attempts to hurt me, I take it in stride because I have a loving family, a strong faith and wonderful friends and fans who have, and continue, to support me. (2007)


      [on his career] It all went by so fast, didn't it? I wish I could do it all over again, I really do.


      [on refuting persistent rumors of skin surgery or bleaching] If I had a chance to talk to Michelangelo, I would ask him what inspired him to become who he is, the anatomy of his craftsmanship, not about who he dated last night or why he decided to sit out in the sun so long.


      When I was 16, we were doing Las Vegas every night, and Elvis Presley and Sammy Davis Jr. would sit me and my brothers in a row and lecture us. 'Don't ever do drugs,' they told us. I never forgot it.


      Music has been my outlet, my gift to all of the lovers in this world. Through it, my music, I know I will live forever.


      You have to have that tragedy, that pain to pull from. That's what makes a clown great. You can see he's hurting behind the masquerade. He's something else externally. Charles Chaplin did that so beautifully, better than anyone. I can play off those moments, too. I've been through the fire many times.


      I never had the chance to do the fun things kids do: sleepovers, parties, trick-or-treat. There was no Christmas, no holiday celebrating. So now you try to compensate for some of that loss.


      My father is a much nicer person now. I think he realizes his children are everything. Without your family, you have nothing. He's a nice human being. At one time, we'd be horrified if he just showed up. We were scared to death. He turned out really well. I wish it wasn't so late.


      I'm still fascinated by clouds and the sunset. I was making wishes on the rainbow yesterday. I saw the meteor shower. I made a wish every time I saw a shooting star.


      I have confidence in my abilities. I have real perseverance. Nothing can stop me when I put my mind to it.


      I never think about themes. I let the music create itself. I like it to be a potpourri of all kinds of sounds, all kinds of colors, something for everybody, from the farmer in Ireland to the lady who scrubs toilets in Harlem.


      I've had people come to me, and after meeting me, they start crying. I say, "Why are you crying?" They say, "Because I thought you would be stuck up, but you're the nicest person." I say, "Who gave you this judgment?" They tell me they read it. I tell them, "Don't you believe what you read."


      When I'm on stage, it's like a two-hour marathon. I weigh myself before and after each show, and I lose a good 10 pounds. Sweat is all over the stage. Then you get to your hotel and your adrenaline is at its zenith and you can't fall asleep. And you've got a show the next day. It's tough.


      [on calling himself the 'King of Pop'] I never self-proclaimed myself to be anything. If I called up Elizabeth Taylor right now, she would tell you that she coined the phrase. She was introducing me, I think at the American Music Awards, and said in her own words - it wasn't in the script - "I'm a personal fan, and in my opinion he is the king of pop, rock and soul." Then the press started saying "King of Pop" and the fans started. This self-proclaimed garbage, I don't know who said that.


      I sit in my room at home and sometimes cry. It's so hard to make friends. Sometimes I walk around the neighbourhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home.


      [on being asked what he thought his funeral would be like in 2002] It's going to be the greatest show on Earth. That's what I want. Fireworks and everything.


      [on recording in Ireland in 2006] I've never given up on making music. Ireland has inspired me to make a great new album.


      If you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same, then everything that happens in between can be dealt with.


      I am the captain of my ship. I take suggestions and listen to what everyone has to say, but the final decision is mine.


      [on his father] He is a very jealous father. He isn't gonna show you love, but anybody that gets closer to us than him he would tell them, 'Leave my boys alone!' To tell you the truth, I never have felt close to him. He has always been like a mystery man.


      I would like some way to disappear where people don't see me anymore at some point. I don't want to grow old. I never want to look in the mirror and see that.


      The greatest education in the world is watching the masters at work.


      In a world filled with hate, we must still dare to hope. In a world filled with anger, we must still dare to comfort. In a world filled with despair, we must still dare to dream. And in a world filled with distrust, we must still dare to believe.


      Why can't you share your bed? The most loving thing you can do is share your bed with someone. It's very charming. It's very sweet. It's what the whole world should do.


      A star can never die. It just turns into a smile and melts back into the cosmic music, the dance of life.


      [the three most important rules for any aspiring pop star] Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
