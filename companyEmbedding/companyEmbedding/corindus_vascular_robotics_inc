Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Provides Revenue Guidance for the Full Year 2017
May 9 17
Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported revenue of $777,000 compared to $1,108,000 a year ago. Operating loss was $9,751,000 compared to $7,245,000 a year ago. Net loss was $9,885,000 or $0.07 per basic and diluted share compared to $7,627,000 or $0.06 per basic and diluted share a year ago. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the deferral of system revenue associated with a future obligation to upgrade multiple customer units from the CorPath 200 System to the CorPath GRX System.

The company continues to expect full year 2017 revenue to be in the range of $13 million to $15 million as well as the implementation of at least 25 new cardiovascular programs in 2017.

About Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc.


      Corindus 
      Vascular Robotics, Inc. is a global technology leader in 
      robotic-assisted vascular interventions. The company's CorPath® 
      System is the first FDA-cleared medical device to bring robotic 
      precision to percutaneous coronary interventions. During the procedure, 
      the interventional cardiologist sits at a radiation-shielded workstation 
      to advance guide catheters, stents, and guidewires with 
      millimeter-by-millimeter precision. The workstation allows the physician 
      greater control and the freedom from wearing heavy lead protective 
      equipment that causes musculoskeletal injuries. With the CorPath System, 
      Corindus Vascular Robotics brings robotic precision to interventional 
      procedures to help optimize clinical outcomes and minimize the costs 
      associated with complications of improper stent placement during manual 
      procedures. Corindus stands behind its product with its unique $1,000 
      hospital credit "One Stent Program." For additional information, visit www.corindus.com, 
      and follow @CorindusInc.

Corindus Vascular Robotics.


Corindus Vascular Robotics (Corindus, Inc.) was founded in 2002 by Rafael Beyar, an interventional cardiologist, and Tal Wenderow. Its goal is to use remote control and robotics to move coronary guidewires and balloon/stent catheters.[1][2]
Corindus, Inc. is based in Waltham, Massachusetts. The company’s FDA-cleared CorPath® System is the first medical device that allows interventional cardiologists to manipulate guidewires and balloon/stents from an interventional cockpit.[3]
The company went public in August 2014 and currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol CVRS.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Corindus Vascular Robotics Announces Closing of Private Placement for $45 Million | Business Wire
























































Corindus Vascular Robotics Announces Closing of Private Placement for 
      $45 Million




Louis A. Cannon, M.D. Appointed to Corindus Board of Directors






March 16, 2017 06:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time



WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Corindus 
      Vascular Robotics, Inc. (NYSE MKT: CVRS), a leading developer of 
      precision vascular robotics, today announced the closing of its 
      previously announced private placement pursuant to which it issued and 
      sold an aggregate of 68,055,700 shares of its common stock at a purchase 
      price of $0.6616 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the 
      Company of approximately $45,000,000 before deducting offering expenses. 
      The Company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, 
      and to fund the Company's ongoing growth, including global 
      commercialization of its recently FDA-cleared next-generation CorPath® 
      GRX System.
    


      In connection with the financing, Louis A. Cannon, M.D., a recognized 
      leader in cardiovascular research and development, was appointed to the 
      Company’s Board of Directors. Dr. Cannon is a practicing Interventional 
      Cardiologist for the Michigan Heart and Vascular Specialists, the Senior 
      Program Director for the McLaren Northern Michigan Heart and Vascular 
      Institute, and the founder and President of the Cardiac & Vascular 
      Research Center of Northern Michigan. He is also founder and Senior 
      Managing Director of BioStar Private Equity Fund I and BioStar Ventures 
      Fund II and III ("BioStar"), all closely-held private companies, which 
      together manage over $150 million in venture capital and over $400 
      million in assets and management. BioStar participated in the Company’s 
      private placement.
    

      "Corindus will play a major transformational role in cardiac and 
      vascular intervention," stated Dr. Cannon. "This technology reduces 
      procedural variability, physician fatigue and radiation exposure, 
      especially in lengthy procedures. Robotics also has the future potential 
      to treat strokes and heart attacks tele-robotically. If we can treat 
      patients tele-robotically from hospital centers of excellence, we can 
      impact humanity in a truly meaningful way, especially in geographic 
      areas that lack the required physician expertise."
    

      This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the 
      solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any 
      sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which 
      such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the 
      registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such 
      state and other jurisdiction.
    

      The securities offered and sold by Corindus in the private placement 
      have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 
      or state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United 
      States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
      ("SEC") or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. 
      Corindus has agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC 
      covering the resale of the shares of common stock sold in the private 
      placement within 45 days of the closing of the private placement. Any 
      resale of Corindus’ securities under such resale registration statement 
      will be made only by means of a prospectus.
