About Dr. Pugliese
Dr. Pugliese was recently featured as an industry LEGEND by Dermascope magazine.
Peter T. Pugliese, MD practiced family medicine before dedicating over 40 years to the science of skin and aging. He is the author of many publications, including the 2005 landmark text, Advanced Professional Skin Care, Medical Edition. He is considered to be the most honored and beloved educator in the professional skin care industry, both in the United States and abroad. Click here for Dr. Pugliese’s complete Curriculum Vitae.
Michael Q. Pugliese, LE, grandson of Dr. Pugliese, is CEO of Circadia by Dr. Pugliese and the Circadia Institute of Advanced Esthetics. After working side-by-side with Dr. Pugliese in the lab and on the road for many years, he has become a respected educator world-wide. Michael and Dr. Pugliese take great pride in presenting the latest science for skin care professionals.
The integration of medicine, science and nature is the basis of our fundamental concept for creating functional products to enhance skin health and longevity. Only ingredients that can be proven by science are used in the formulation of Circadia products.
Circadia by Dr. Pugliese has become a global force in the skin care industry, with product distributors throughout the United States as well as Canada, the UK, and New Zealand, Australia, and Mexico. Circadia treatments and retail products are sold exclusively through estheticians and physicians.
