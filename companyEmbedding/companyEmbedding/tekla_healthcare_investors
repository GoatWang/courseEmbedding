FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Share In Healthcare & Biotech Gains With An 8.3% Yield - Tekla Healthcare Investors (NYSE:HQH) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Share In Healthcare & Biotech Gains With An 8.3% YieldApr.21.16 | About: Tekla Healthcare (HQH) Rida Morwa Research analyst, REITs, energy, Dividend income for retireesMarketplaceHigh Dividend OpportunitiesSummaryFollowing the recent general market rally, some sectors are starting to look overvalued. The biotech sector remains at quite attractive valuation levels.The recent pullback has created a unique opportunity to buy into undervalued biotech companies, as the five-to-ten-year investment outlook for this sector remains compelling.For income investors who wish exposure to biotech, buying directly into stocks may not be an option due to the generally low dividends and higher short-term volatility.Tekla Healthcare Investors is a sensible and diversified product. HQH offers the opportunity to share in the long-term upside while providing a relatively steady income (yield 8.3%).Healthcare & biotech exposure can play a role in every balanced portfolio, not only because it provides diversity, but also because of its fast growth, which is generally not dependent on the state of the economy. Companies in this sector are able to increase their revenues even during uncertain times, such as a recession. These are deemed as non-cyclical stocks, so they are not as much affected during economic downturns. The Biotech Sector: An outstanding performer for long-term investors Over the past 7 years, the Biotech Sector tracked by the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) has been one of the most profitable and best performing sectors. The index is up 331% since 2009 compared to the S&P 500, tracked by the ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY), which is up 156% for the same period. The Biotech index IBB has outperformed the S&P sector by over 120%. This outperformance includes the effect of the recent selloff in Biotech stocks. 

 After reaching its all-time highs in July 2015, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology has seen substantial declines. The selloff was quite severe, resulting in IBB losing over 28% of its value.
 The reasons behind the selloff in the Healthcare/Biotech Stocks The recent biotech pullback was the result of multiple factors. The following are the reasons for this selloff:   High Valuations: Investors in general felt that valuations were getting stretched. High valuations, especially for a few highly publicized companies, have played a major part in the recent selloff for this sector.  Drug Pricing Policies: Several questions relating to drug pricing policies by certain healthcare companies have had an impact on healthcare sector sentiment and helped fuel the price declines.  Negative Political Publicity: Considerable negative political publicity emerged following the action of a pharmaceutical company that acquired a niche product and quickly implemented more than 50-fold increase in the price of the product. Concerns about pricing power in the healthcare sector have heightened volatility and downward pressure, particularly in situations where pricing may not reflect value to patients. At least one presidential candidate has elected to emphasize drug pricing in her campaign, weakening sentiment towards the sector and, ultimately exacerbating the pullback.  Valeant effect: Other worries have stemmed from troubles at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (NYSE:VRX), which expanded rapidly by buying companies. Valeant's stock has lost nearly 90% of its value since August amid concerns about its business and accounting practices. This was the latest negative news to affect this sector.  Exaggerated concerns  The current concerns about pricing power in the healthcare and biotech industries are overblown. The vast majority of healthcare and drug companies prefer to price their new and novel products based on the value they bring to patients. Therefore, most companies try to price their products fairly. The negative publicity was the result of few who tarnished the entire image of the sector. At the moment, the government is limited in its ability to "control" drug pricing. This situation is unlikely to be changing soon. 
 Reversing Trends The sentiment on the biotech sector looks like it is shifting to a more positive one. Over the past month, the biotechnology sector ETF IBB has gained over 10%. It seems that investors have started bottom fishing for companies with attractive valuations. Positive factors in favor of investing in Healthcare and Biotech now  The healthcare and biotech market has been growing at an explosive rate for the last 2-3 years. In the last couple of years, there have been more than 225 priced IPOs raising more than $25 billion in the sector. Robust M&A activity in the healthcare sector makes it quite attractive. Total spending on prescription drugs in the U.S. rose 12.2% to nearly $425B in 2015, continuing a steep climb fueled by the introduction of new drugs for cancer and infections. The large number of new drugs in the pipelines and strong sales are likely to continue fueling high earnings growth for this sector. Solid earnings will ultimately result in a more positive sentiment for this sector. Growing Customer Base: The aging population in the US and globally will increase demand for healthcare and biotechnology. It is estimated that the number of Americans age 55 and older will almost double between 2016 and 2030 - from 60 million (21% of the total population), to over 100 million (31% of total population). Beyond America, there is an opportunity to export innovative care to new markets with an emerging middle class that previously might not have had access to more costly treatments. Aging population is a phenomenon currently affecting Europe, Canada, Japan and several other countries. Impact of Insurance: The increase in the number of insured individuals means that more patients will have access to healthcare and will be able to pay for the treatment needed. New Cures & New Opportunities: There are several conditions with no effective treatment such as Alzheimer's & Parkinson's. New effective treatment would be a game changer for these companies. New technological options, such as gene therapy and robotic surgery, could open the door to improve existing treatment with new methods. At the end of the day, these companies have the ability to improve the quality of life for millions of people. Companies that are highly innovative significantly improve patients' lives and positively impact the cost structure in the health care sector. 
 The result of the selloff: Most attractive valuations Since the selloff which started in September 2015, valuations in the healthcare and biotech sector have dropped markedly. Let us look at the forward PE ratio of the 4 biggest biotech companies Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB). These fast growing companies all have their forward PE lower than the weighted basis of the S&P 500 companies, which currently stands at 18.5x (Wall Street Journal). 

 Source: Morningstar, Yahoo Finance, YCharts, WSJ The P/E ratio for this group has only been below that of the broader index 3 other times in the last 10 years. Based on data from Nasdaq.com, these companies are set for a fast earnings growth in 2016 - compared to the S&P 500 Index with a projected earnings decline in Q1 2016. Growth adjusted earnings (i.e., price earnings growth or PEG) for these 4 biotech companies is at an attractive level in absolute terms. Also relative to its own history and to that of the S&P 500 Index, it is quite attractive. To assess how attractive the current valuations are, one has to look at these PEG ratios (see table above). These are among the best indicators to value fast growing companies. The selloff has resulted in very attractive valuations opening the door for a unique opportunity to buy the shares at a large discount. Tekla Healthcare Investors - A sensible product to get exposure to the healthcare & Biotech sector Tekla Healthcare Investors (NYSE:HQH) is a diversified closed-end healthcare fund traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker HQH. HQH primarily invests in the healthcare industry (including biotechnology, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals).
 The fund is quite diversified and currently holds the largest names in the biotech sector. Its top 10 holdings include the following: 

 This is mostly an equity Closed End Fund (over 90% equity holdings) with its largest two allocations being to Biotechnology 58% and Pharmaceuticals 22%. 

  HQH is a fund structured in the form of an income paying closed-end fund. It is ideal for those income investors or retirees who want exposure to this fast growing sector while at the same time wish to receive a regular paycheck. In addition to the current general attractive valuations in the sector, HQH currently offers investors the possibility to buy into the fund at a 4.2% discount to Net Asset Value (NAV). The distributions: HQH pays quarterly distributions at a rate of 2% of the Fund's net assets NAV. With a 4.2% discount, the quarterly distribution gets a boost and results in a dividend rate of 8.3% instead of the intended 8% rate based on NAV. The fund pays distributions primarily from capital gains achieved from its underlying stock holdings. However, if gains are insufficient to meet the distribution, shareholders can be paid return of capital. The fund made a return of capital only twice in 2009 (almost no eroding returns). For over 28 years, HQH has been able to return 8% annually to shareholders from capital gains and income with no ROC (except in 2 quarters), even during the worst financial crisis. Over the long term, biotech funds have a history of outperforming the broad-market indexes. During the past seven years, the biotech index outperformed the S&P 500 by about 120%. One big advantage of the biotech sector is its relative immunity to economic downturns. In fact, biotech came out quite well during the 2008 financial crisis. It had a shallower pullback and outperformed the S&P 500 during the recovery. Tekla Life Sciences Investors Fund has a solid long-term performance record. Over the past 7 years, HQH has delivered a capital gain of 148% plus hefty dividend distributions. On a total return basis (with dividend reinvested), HQH delivered a 320% return to its shareholders. 
 

 It is worth to note that the sponsor Tekla is a successful healthcare fund manager with a proven track record (managed HQH since 1988). It is currently the investment adviser for 4 closed-end equity funds, including Tekla Healthcare Investors, Tekla Life Science Investors (NYSE:HQL). Difference between Tekla Healthcare Investors and Tekla Life Sciences Tekla Life Sciences is also a closed-end fund which invests in the healthcare and biotech; however, it has a broader mandate than HQH to include more healthcare technology. It also has a higher weight to smaller biotech companies. As a result, HQL tends to be a little more volatile than its sister fund HQH. Over the past 5 years, HQH outperformed HQL by 10%. 

 Conclusion Following the recent general market rally, some sectors are starting to look overvalued. The biotech sector remains at quite attractive levels. The recent pullback has created a very attractive opportunity for investors to buy into undervalued biotech companies, as the five-to-ten-year investment story for this sector remains compelling. This sector warrants a place in a diversified portfolio, and can possibly provide some great returns going forward. For income investors who wish exposure to biotech, buying directly into stocks may not be an option due to the generally low dividends and higher short-term volatility. HQH is a sensible and diversified product which offers the opportunity to share in the long-term upside while providing a relatively steady income.

What is BIM?“With BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology, one or more accurate virtual models of a building are constructed digitally. They support design through its phases, allowing better analysis and control than manual processes. When completed, these computer-generated models contain precise geometry and data needed to support the construction, fabrication, and procurement activities through which the building is realized.”Learn more about BIM
