After Gordon, I transferred to Athens Technical College and graduated with an Associate of Applied Science in Dental Hygiene in 2008. I was presented with the Hu-Friedy Golden Scaler Award for exemplary clinical skills. Some of my continuing education classes include, Oral Cancer, Sure-Smile Orthodontics, Air Polishing, and Soft Tissue Management.RestorativeBridgesDental BondingOften used to improve the appearance of your teeth and enhance your smile. As the name indicates, composite material, either a plastic or resin, is bonded to an existing tooth. Unlike veneers or crowns, composite bonding removes little, if any, of the original tooth.FillingsWhite fillings bond to the tooth; they strengthen the tooth by restoring most of its original shape. Silver amalgams, on the other hand, weaken the teeth and make them more susceptible to breaking. Broken teeth can be very expensive to replace.Resin CompositeComposite resins come in many different shades and provide better matching of shades to the natural color of your teeth.VeneersWe now have Lumineersâ„¢ by Cerinate available in our office! Lumineersâ„¢ can make everyoneâ€™s smile more beautiful without removal of painful tooth structure. Lumineersâ„¢ are a painless, permanent cosmetic solution for stained, chipped, discolored or misaligned teeth. Lumineersâ„¢ are porcelain veneers that can be made as thin as a contact lens and are placed over existing teeth without drilling or requiring removal of painful tooth structure, in most cases (unlike traditional veneers). And in most cases, no anesthesia shots are needed!CrownsComposite bonds, however, are not as durable and long-lasting as veneers and crowns and may need to be re-touched or replaced in the future.EndodonticsRoot Canal TreatmentAn endodontist is a specialist in the area of soft tissue inside the tooth. Endodontists, who perform root canals, receive advanced education after graduating from dental school and typically only deal with endodontic-related problems.ProsthodonticsDenturesPlease read some of the other information provided in other areas of our web page, especially  the lumineers and veneers restorations. We provide General Dentistry, crowns and bridges, extractions, dentures and partial dentures, orthodontics, TMJ (jaw joint) therapy, non-surgical gum treatment, tooth (teeth) whitening, outpatient hospital treatment, snoring and sleep apnea therapy, halitosis (bad breath) therapy, and more. Call our office (706) 546-7390 if you have a question about a treatment therapy.GeneralTeeth WhiteningI grew up in Carnesville, Georgia and graduated in 1993 from Greenville Technical College with a degree in Health Science, major in Dental Hygiene. I have been with the Athena Dental family since April 2000. My past continuing education courses have included ZOOM whitening and periodontal management. Each year, I continue these and other studies. I live in Hartwell with my husband of 14 years. When not practicing dental hygiene, I enjoy working on our cattle farm and spending time with my pets.General DentistryDentistry today is a very advanced science. With all of the available technology, people generally don't want to be treated as if the clock had been turned back to the 50's and 60's. Now, some people yearn for the good ole' days, when a loaf of bread was 25 cents and a gallon of gas was 18 cents and dentistry was cheap, but wait - was it really cheap? What price do you put on your own teeth and smile? In today's terms, less and less of your health care dollar is spent on dentistry. Why? Because fluoride in the drinking water does work. It prevents a lot of cavities. Also, education is much better today. We know more about cause and effect and what works and what doesn't work. Then, technology makes procedures faster and safer. We know more about infectious disease today than we used to, so we do more prevention. Safety and sterility are critical necessities today. It's true that there are annoyances for patients and dental teams alike because of these changes. But, if you must choose either the old way or the modern way, I hope you are looking forward and expect even more improvements in dental care as time goes by. I know that we at Athena Dental pledge to stay on the leading edge of knowledge and technology and stay up to date on our procedures and services.PreventiveTeeth CleaningFluoride TreatmentTooth decay is a progressive disease resulting in the interaction of bacteria that naturally occur on the teeth and sugars in the everyday diet. Sugar causes a reaction in the bacteria, causing it to produce acids that break down the mineral in teeth, forming a cavity. Dentists remove the decay and fill the tooth using a variety of fillings, restoring the tooth to a healthy state. Nerve damage can result from severe decay and may require a crown (a crown is like a large filling that can cap a tooth, making it stronger or covering it). Avoiding unnecessary decay simply requires strict adherence to a dental hygiene regimen: brushing and flossing twice a day, regular dental checkups, diet control and fluoride treatment. Practicing good hygiene avoids unhealthy teeth and costly treatment.Dental SealantsTooth sealants protect these susceptible areas by sealing the grooves and depressions, preventing bacteria and food particles from residing in these areas. Sealant material is a resin typically applied to the back teeth, molars and premolars and areas prone to cavities. It lasts for several years but needs to be checked during regular appointments.DiagnosticOral Cancer ScreeningAfter graduating from high school, I attended the University of Georgia and have been employed with Athena Dental Associates since 1988. I enjoy painting, interior design, reading and art. CE credits: Lumineers, Sapphire bleaching, Hollander Management, Vizilite (oral cancer screening), training with the Cerec CAD machine for porcelain restorations, and CPR.Dental ExaminationOral and Maxillofacial SurgeryOral SurgeryTooth ExtractionsTo potentially stave off this result, an extraction of one, several or all of the wisdom teeth may be advised. If that is the case, we have the equipment and training needed to perform such extractions, with an absolute minimum of discomfort. You may require treatment from an oral surgeon.  Ask our staff for more information regarding tooth extractions if you feel you may need one.Send to PhoneBlankenship, Mark H DMD1020 Hawthorne Ave, Athens, GA 30606(706) 546-7390Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailBlankenship, Mark H DMD1020 Hawthorne Ave, Athens, GA 30606(706) 546-7390Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
