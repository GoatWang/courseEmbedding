Joseph W. LEWIS


Obituary
Condolences


































 LEWIS, Joseph W.   Son of Laura Belle Rigg Lewis and Joseph W. Lewis.  Born September 7, 1918, in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, peacefully passed away on February 20, 2013, to be with his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He leaves his beloved wife of 70 years, Anne Caroline Beech Lewis; three children, Joseph Walters Lewis, III, of Shoreline, Washington, John Rigg Lewis, of Los Alamitos, California, and Katharine Anne Lewis, of Rancho Santa Fe, California; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.  In 1929, when Joe was 10 years old, his family moved to San Marino, California, from Wilkinsburg. Joe attended South Pasadena / San Marino High School and graduated from the California Institute of Technology in 1941 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering.  Joe and Anne were married in 1943. Following Joe's service in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Joe and Anne moved to San Marino and lived there for 66 years. In 1995, the San Marino Rotary Club selected Joe and Anne as San Marino's "Most Distinguished Couple" for their extraordinary service to their community. Joe was active as a leader in Cub Scouts (Cub Master), the San Marino Community Church (deacon, elder, and Men's Club), the San Marino City Council (Vice-Mayor), Community Chest (President), San Marino Board of Education (President), San Marino Rotary (President), and Caltech (Alumni President). In 1986, Joe was named "Outstanding Citizen of San Marino".  He was a vice-president at Beckman Instruments, Inc. and later owned and operated DBP Microwave, Inc. and DB Products, Inc..  According to Joe's wishes, people may contribute, in memory of Joseph W. Lewis, Jr., to the Caltech "Athenaeum Preservation Fund," 551 S. Hill Avenue, Pasadena, CA 91106; or to the "Caltech Alumni Fund," 1200 E. California Boulevard, M-Code 5-32, Pasadena, CA 91125.   Services will be held Friday, March 1, 10:00 a.m., at Todd Memorial Chapel, 325 N. Indian Hill Blvd, Claremont, CA 91711.

                    By jedwarga 
                

                                        Jan 2, 2011
                


                                A family saga that details the life story of an 18 year-old Italian immigrant who steps on the USA shores at Ellis Island. The irony is the stepping of his grandsons who proudly enter a nearby NYC site called Madison Square Garden to coach the Knicks 100 years later. A poignant story of survival, family love, and Appalachian/Italian fortitude, it's an interesting, quick read.

                                As a former student of Mr. D'Antoni and friend of his family I have to say this was very interesting reading. I normally don't read but couldn't put this book down. What an interesting life he has had. Mr. D'Antoni did a great job and I would recommend reading this book. This is one fine man from a fine family and Mullens, West Virginia is very lucky that his family settled here.

This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

About this Book
About this Book




True Myth examines the meaning and significance of myth as understood by C.S. Lewis and Joseph Campbell and its place in the Christian faith in a technological society. C.S. Lewis defined Christianity, and being truly human, as a relationship between the personal Creator and his creation mediated through faith in his son, Jesus. The influential writer and mythologist Joseph Campbell had a different perspective, understanding Christianity as composed of mythical themes similar to those in other religious and secular myths. While accepting certain portions of the biblical record as historical, Campbell taught the theological and miraculous aspects as symbolic – as stories in which the reader discovers what it means to be human today. In contrast, Lewis presented the theological and the miraculous in a literal way. Although Lewis understood how one could see symbolism and lessons for life in miraculous events, he believed they were more than symbolic and indeed took place in human history.


In True Myth, James W. Menzies skilfully balances the two writers' differing approaches to guide the reader through a complex interaction of myth with philosophy, media, ethics, history, literature, art, music and religion in a contemporary world.

Reviews and Comments
Reviews and Comments




True Myth is an important book that has long needed to be written. Menzies has performed yeoman service in synthesising a great deal of material on topics that deserve closer examination. While being fair to the legacy of Joseph Campbell, Menzies presents a rich and nuanced understanding of myth that would have pleased C.S. Lewis.
Louis Markos, Professor of English, Houston Baptist University, Greater Sharpstown, Texas


A valuable book to put into the hands of anyone whose faith has been shaken by Frazer's The Golden Bough, or to have as ammunition for a discussion group the next time someone says Christianity is 'just a myth'.
Kirsty Anderson, in The Reader, Vol 114, No 4

Publisher's Description▼▲
From Glory to Glory, the Joe Lewis Story is an account of Joe's journey from the glory of the world to the glory of God. The account starts with the beginning details of his life and proceeds through his serving in the United States Air Force and ending with the planning to form several evangelistic ministries. The account contains descriptions of supernatural events, humor, despair, and joy. Joe Lewis was born on August 6, 1961 in Burlington, Vermont. He grew up mostly in Huntington Center, Vermont near Camel's Hump Mountain. He did very well in school and with a four-year Air Force scholarship obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Aviation Computer Science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. Joe served five years in the Air Force during which he went to Undergraduate Pilot Training for a while and ended his service as a captain at the Pentagon working directly for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He then went through several years of depression and including homelessness on the street. Today, Joe is involved in evangelism, inventing, and writing.

Joseph

 The fashionable Velvet revival sees one of its most dynamic and stunning interpretations with a striking and arresting floral design which comes in a rich and tawny brown and a hot and colourful blue toned colourway. Perfect for creating what we like to call 'heirloom upholstery' this is a delicious statement fabric which is guaranteed to both lift the spirits and throw instant colour and texture into a room.
