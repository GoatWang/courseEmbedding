Overview[edit]
Founded in 1939,[3] Neuberger Berman is a privately held asset management firm, which is 100%[4][5] owned by its employees. It serves pension plans, charitable organizations, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions, as well as high-net-worth individuals and mutual fund investors, both directly and through financial intermediaries and other partners. The firm has a broad range of investment capabilities, which have enabled it to win numerous public strategic partnership mandates, most notably from Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the National Social Security Fund of China.[6] For its private clients, Neuberger Berman also provides financial planning, fiduciary services, and trust services. Known as a firm of investors, the firm has maintained a 97% retention rate among its senior investment teams since 2009,[7] and has been recognized for its distinctive firm culture.[8][9]
History[edit]
Neuberger Berman was founded as "Neuberger & Berman" in 1939, by Roy R. Neuberger and Robert Berman.
In the decades that followed its founding, the firm's growth mirrored that of the asset-management industry as a whole. Its success in managing separate accounts, led it to establish the Guardian Fund, in 1950, one of the first no-load mutual funds in the United States. Today, the firm’s complex of open and closed-end mutual funds, includes other well-known funds, including Century Fund (renamed Large Cap Disciplined Growth Fund) and Genesis Fund. In the 1960s, the firm expanded into the management of pension plans and assets of other institutions.




Pre-Lehman bankruptcy logo


After 60 years as a private firm, in October 1999, Neuberger Berman conducted an initial public offering of its shares and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol "NEU". With the firm's IPO, Larry Zicklin, who had joined the firm in 1969, retired as Chairman of its executive committee. He was succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by Jeffrey B. Lane.
Lehman Brothers acquisition and bankruptcy[edit]
In July 2003, shortly after the retired Mr. Neuberger's 100th birthday, the company announced that it was in merger discussions with Lehman Brothers. These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm's acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities, or approximately 26 times earnings.[10] That transaction closed in October 2003 and from that time, until 2008, Neuberger Berman served as one of the asset management arms of Lehman Brothers’ Investment Management Division. In that same year, Lehman acquired fixed income manager Lincoln Capital Fixed Income Management and private equity manager Crossroads Group.[11]
Management Buyout[edit]
On September 15, 2008, virtually unprecedented volatility in global securities markets resulted in Lehman Brothers’ collapse and bankruptcy filing. Neuberger Berman continued to operate, notwithstanding Lehman’s bankruptcy and sought opportunities to spin itself off from its parent. On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell its asset management businesses, including Neuberger Berman, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman & Friedman. The transaction was expected to close in early 2009;[12] however, a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction held on December 3, topping the deal with Bain and Hellman.[13] The firm spun itself off in May 2009, in a transaction recognized by Fund Industry Intelligence as Deal of the Year.[14] Lehman Brothers' creditors initially retained a 49% common equity interest in the firm and a $875 million preferred equity stake.[13] with a coupon that climbed to 12% over three years. The preferred equity position was fully repaid in 2012.[15][16] The new entity, including Neuberger, Lincoln Capital, and Crossroads, was named Neuberger Berman Group LLC.[17] Under employee control, Larry Zicklin rejoined the firm as a member of the Board of Directors. Lehman Brothers creditors have received over $1.5 billion from the employees of Neuberger Berman, dwarfing the proceeds paid by Barclays and Nomura for businesses representing 90% of Lehman Brothers employees.[18]
Independence and Expansion[edit]
Since its reemergence as an independent firm, Neuberger Berman has enjoyed a period of sustained growth. The firm increased its assets under management 14% per year from 2010 to 2014,[19] reaching $250 billion,[20] which placed the firm at the top of its peer group by asset growth.[19] The firm currently employs approximately 2,000 people,[20] and has expanded beyond its traditional equity focus into the growing areas of emerging markets debt,[21] high-yield bonds,[22] liquid alternatives and private equity,[23][24] among other strategies. During this period the firm expanded its global presence, adding coverage offices in key Asia-Pacific markets and elsewhere to be closer to a growing overseas client base.[25]
The end of 2014 marked Neuberger Berman’s return to full employee ownership, highlighting the firm’s independence and clearing the path for future growth.[26][27] Employee ownership has been recognized by industry leaders as a key factor in the success of asset management firms, and Neuberger Berman’s position as an employee-owned firm is cited as a reason for its high talent retention rate.[28] In recognition of its culture, Neuberger Berman won the top rank in its category on Pensions & Investments' 2016 Best Places to Work in Money Management survey,[2] and had been named to the Best Places list in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[29][30][31]
Offices[edit]




1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York City.


In October 2016, the firm moved its global headquarters to 1290 Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan.[32][33]
In addition, the firm has approximately 28 other offices in key countries around the world. Regional headquarters are in Hong Kong, London and Tokyo, and has additional primary portfolio management centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, The Hague and Singapore.[34][33]
Former headquarters in New York City include 605 Third Avenue,[32] 522 Fifth Avenue and, originally, The Biltmore Hotel.[35]
Philanthropy[edit]
Collectively, Neuberger Berman’s philanthropic efforts are called NB Impacts. NB Impacts includes both employee community service and the grant-making actions of the Neuberger Berman Foundation.[36] The Neuberger Berman Foundation offers grants focusing on at-risk children, youth educational programs, and economic sustainability.[37][38][39][40]
Neuberger Berman conducts an annual week-long program in the spring called “Celebration with Service,” which holds community service events in the cities where the firm has offices.[36][41][42] For its 75th anniversary year in 2014, the firm’s “Celebration with Service” supported 75 volunteer projects worldwide.[36] Since 2012, NB Impacts has deployed more than 4,500 volunteers to work with over 5,000 youth and 800 senior citizens, and also includes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours spent on improving parks and community spaces.[36][43] Through the years, some of the programs Neuberger Berman has been involved in are: The Y,[44] Homes for Heroes,[45] Per Scholas,[46] C-CAP,[47] New York City Service,[48][49] and Habitat for Humanity.[50]
Corporate art collection[edit]
Contemporary art in the workplace has been part of Neuberger Berman’s corporate culture since 1939, when renowned collector Roy Neuberger co-founded the investment firm.[51] In 1990 the firm began developing its own art collection.[52][53] The firm's corporate art collection was absorbed into the Lehman Brothers collection but Neuberger Berman repurchased many of them when the collection was sold at auction in 2010.[54] Today, the Neuberger Berman Collection supports the work of contemporary artists, prominently displaying their work in the firm’s hallways, reception areas and meeting rooms.[51] The collection creates a stimulating and enriching environment for both employees and visitors.

Overview[edit]
Founded in 1939,[3] Neuberger Berman is a privately held asset management firm, which is 100%[4][5] owned by its employees. It serves pension plans, charitable organizations, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions, as well as high-net-worth individuals and mutual fund investors, both directly and through financial intermediaries and other partners. The firm has a broad range of investment capabilities, which have enabled it to win numerous public strategic partnership mandates, most notably from Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the National Social Security Fund of China.[6] For its private clients, Neuberger Berman also provides financial planning, fiduciary services, and trust services. Known as a firm of investors, the firm has maintained a 97% retention rate among its senior investment teams since 2009,[7] and has been recognized for its distinctive firm culture.[8][9]
History[edit]
Neuberger Berman was founded as "Neuberger & Berman" in 1939, by Roy R. Neuberger and Robert Berman.
In the decades that followed its founding, the firm's growth mirrored that of the asset-management industry as a whole. Its success in managing separate accounts, led it to establish the Guardian Fund, in 1950, one of the first no-load mutual funds in the United States. Today, the firm’s complex of open and closed-end mutual funds, includes other well-known funds, including Century Fund (renamed Large Cap Disciplined Growth Fund) and Genesis Fund. In the 1960s, the firm expanded into the management of pension plans and assets of other institutions.




Pre-Lehman bankruptcy logo


After 60 years as a private firm, in October 1999, Neuberger Berman conducted an initial public offering of its shares and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol "NEU". With the firm's IPO, Larry Zicklin, who had joined the firm in 1969, retired as Chairman of its executive committee. He was succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by Jeffrey B. Lane.
Lehman Brothers acquisition and bankruptcy[edit]
In July 2003, shortly after the retired Mr. Neuberger's 100th birthday, the company announced that it was in merger discussions with Lehman Brothers. These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm's acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities, or approximately 26 times earnings.[10] That transaction closed in October 2003 and from that time, until 2008, Neuberger Berman served as one of the asset management arms of Lehman Brothers’ Investment Management Division. In that same year, Lehman acquired fixed income manager Lincoln Capital Fixed Income Management and private equity manager Crossroads Group.[11]
Management Buyout[edit]
On September 15, 2008, virtually unprecedented volatility in global securities markets resulted in Lehman Brothers’ collapse and bankruptcy filing. Neuberger Berman continued to operate, notwithstanding Lehman’s bankruptcy and sought opportunities to spin itself off from its parent. On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell its asset management businesses, including Neuberger Berman, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman & Friedman. The transaction was expected to close in early 2009;[12] however, a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction held on December 3, topping the deal with Bain and Hellman.[13] The firm spun itself off in May 2009, in a transaction recognized by Fund Industry Intelligence as Deal of the Year.[14] Lehman Brothers' creditors initially retained a 49% common equity interest in the firm and a $875 million preferred equity stake.[13] with a coupon that climbed to 12% over three years. The preferred equity position was fully repaid in 2012.[15][16] The new entity, including Neuberger, Lincoln Capital, and Crossroads, was named Neuberger Berman Group LLC.[17] Under employee control, Larry Zicklin rejoined the firm as a member of the Board of Directors. Lehman Brothers creditors have received over $1.5 billion from the employees of Neuberger Berman, dwarfing the proceeds paid by Barclays and Nomura for businesses representing 90% of Lehman Brothers employees.[18]
Independence and Expansion[edit]
Since its reemergence as an independent firm, Neuberger Berman has enjoyed a period of sustained growth. The firm increased its assets under management 14% per year from 2010 to 2014,[19] reaching $250 billion,[20] which placed the firm at the top of its peer group by asset growth.[19] The firm currently employs approximately 2,000 people,[20] and has expanded beyond its traditional equity focus into the growing areas of emerging markets debt,[21] high-yield bonds,[22] liquid alternatives and private equity,[23][24] among other strategies. During this period the firm expanded its global presence, adding coverage offices in key Asia-Pacific markets and elsewhere to be closer to a growing overseas client base.[25]
The end of 2014 marked Neuberger Berman’s return to full employee ownership, highlighting the firm’s independence and clearing the path for future growth.[26][27] Employee ownership has been recognized by industry leaders as a key factor in the success of asset management firms, and Neuberger Berman’s position as an employee-owned firm is cited as a reason for its high talent retention rate.[28] In recognition of its culture, Neuberger Berman won the top rank in its category on Pensions & Investments' 2016 Best Places to Work in Money Management survey,[2] and had been named to the Best Places list in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[29][30][31]
Offices[edit]




1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York City.


In October 2016, the firm moved its global headquarters to 1290 Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan.[32][33]
In addition, the firm has approximately 28 other offices in key countries around the world. Regional headquarters are in Hong Kong, London and Tokyo, and has additional primary portfolio management centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, The Hague and Singapore.[34][33]
Former headquarters in New York City include 605 Third Avenue,[32] 522 Fifth Avenue and, originally, The Biltmore Hotel.[35]
Philanthropy[edit]
Collectively, Neuberger Berman’s philanthropic efforts are called NB Impacts. NB Impacts includes both employee community service and the grant-making actions of the Neuberger Berman Foundation.[36] The Neuberger Berman Foundation offers grants focusing on at-risk children, youth educational programs, and economic sustainability.[37][38][39][40]
Neuberger Berman conducts an annual week-long program in the spring called “Celebration with Service,” which holds community service events in the cities where the firm has offices.[36][41][42] For its 75th anniversary year in 2014, the firm’s “Celebration with Service” supported 75 volunteer projects worldwide.[36] Since 2012, NB Impacts has deployed more than 4,500 volunteers to work with over 5,000 youth and 800 senior citizens, and also includes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours spent on improving parks and community spaces.[36][43] Through the years, some of the programs Neuberger Berman has been involved in are: The Y,[44] Homes for Heroes,[45] Per Scholas,[46] C-CAP,[47] New York City Service,[48][49] and Habitat for Humanity.[50]
Corporate art collection[edit]
Contemporary art in the workplace has been part of Neuberger Berman’s corporate culture since 1939, when renowned collector Roy Neuberger co-founded the investment firm.[51] In 1990 the firm began developing its own art collection.[52][53] The firm's corporate art collection was absorbed into the Lehman Brothers collection but Neuberger Berman repurchased many of them when the collection was sold at auction in 2010.[54] Today, the Neuberger Berman Collection supports the work of contemporary artists, prominently displaying their work in the firm’s hallways, reception areas and meeting rooms.[51] The collection creates a stimulating and enriching environment for both employees and visitors.

Overview[edit]
Founded in 1939,[3] Neuberger Berman is a privately held asset management firm, which is 100%[4][5] owned by its employees. It serves pension plans, charitable organizations, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions, as well as high-net-worth individuals and mutual fund investors, both directly and through financial intermediaries and other partners. The firm has a broad range of investment capabilities, which have enabled it to win numerous public strategic partnership mandates, most notably from Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the National Social Security Fund of China.[6] For its private clients, Neuberger Berman also provides financial planning, fiduciary services, and trust services. Known as a firm of investors, the firm has maintained a 97% retention rate among its senior investment teams since 2009,[7] and has been recognized for its distinctive firm culture.[8][9]
History[edit]
Neuberger Berman was founded as "Neuberger & Berman" in 1939, by Roy R. Neuberger and Robert Berman.
In the decades that followed its founding, the firm's growth mirrored that of the asset-management industry as a whole. Its success in managing separate accounts, led it to establish the Guardian Fund, in 1950, one of the first no-load mutual funds in the United States. Today, the firm’s complex of open and closed-end mutual funds, includes other well-known funds, including Century Fund (renamed Large Cap Disciplined Growth Fund) and Genesis Fund. In the 1960s, the firm expanded into the management of pension plans and assets of other institutions.




Pre-Lehman bankruptcy logo


After 60 years as a private firm, in October 1999, Neuberger Berman conducted an initial public offering of its shares and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol "NEU". With the firm's IPO, Larry Zicklin, who had joined the firm in 1969, retired as Chairman of its executive committee. He was succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by Jeffrey B. Lane.
Lehman Brothers acquisition and bankruptcy[edit]
In July 2003, shortly after the retired Mr. Neuberger's 100th birthday, the company announced that it was in merger discussions with Lehman Brothers. These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm's acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities, or approximately 26 times earnings.[10] That transaction closed in October 2003 and from that time, until 2008, Neuberger Berman served as one of the asset management arms of Lehman Brothers’ Investment Management Division. In that same year, Lehman acquired fixed income manager Lincoln Capital Fixed Income Management and private equity manager Crossroads Group.[11]
Management Buyout[edit]
On September 15, 2008, virtually unprecedented volatility in global securities markets resulted in Lehman Brothers’ collapse and bankruptcy filing. Neuberger Berman continued to operate, notwithstanding Lehman’s bankruptcy and sought opportunities to spin itself off from its parent. On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell its asset management businesses, including Neuberger Berman, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman & Friedman. The transaction was expected to close in early 2009;[12] however, a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction held on December 3, topping the deal with Bain and Hellman.[13] The firm spun itself off in May 2009, in a transaction recognized by Fund Industry Intelligence as Deal of the Year.[14] Lehman Brothers' creditors initially retained a 49% common equity interest in the firm and a $875 million preferred equity stake.[13] with a coupon that climbed to 12% over three years. The preferred equity position was fully repaid in 2012.[15][16] The new entity, including Neuberger, Lincoln Capital, and Crossroads, was named Neuberger Berman Group LLC.[17] Under employee control, Larry Zicklin rejoined the firm as a member of the Board of Directors. Lehman Brothers creditors have received over $1.5 billion from the employees of Neuberger Berman, dwarfing the proceeds paid by Barclays and Nomura for businesses representing 90% of Lehman Brothers employees.[18]
Independence and Expansion[edit]
Since its reemergence as an independent firm, Neuberger Berman has enjoyed a period of sustained growth. The firm increased its assets under management 14% per year from 2010 to 2014,[19] reaching $250 billion,[20] which placed the firm at the top of its peer group by asset growth.[19] The firm currently employs approximately 2,000 people,[20] and has expanded beyond its traditional equity focus into the growing areas of emerging markets debt,[21] high-yield bonds,[22] liquid alternatives and private equity,[23][24] among other strategies. During this period the firm expanded its global presence, adding coverage offices in key Asia-Pacific markets and elsewhere to be closer to a growing overseas client base.[25]
The end of 2014 marked Neuberger Berman’s return to full employee ownership, highlighting the firm’s independence and clearing the path for future growth.[26][27] Employee ownership has been recognized by industry leaders as a key factor in the success of asset management firms, and Neuberger Berman’s position as an employee-owned firm is cited as a reason for its high talent retention rate.[28] In recognition of its culture, Neuberger Berman won the top rank in its category on Pensions & Investments' 2016 Best Places to Work in Money Management survey,[2] and had been named to the Best Places list in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[29][30][31]
Offices[edit]




1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York City.


In October 2016, the firm moved its global headquarters to 1290 Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan.[32][33]
In addition, the firm has approximately 28 other offices in key countries around the world. Regional headquarters are in Hong Kong, London and Tokyo, and has additional primary portfolio management centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, The Hague and Singapore.[34][33]
Former headquarters in New York City include 605 Third Avenue,[32] 522 Fifth Avenue and, originally, The Biltmore Hotel.[35]
Philanthropy[edit]
Collectively, Neuberger Berman’s philanthropic efforts are called NB Impacts. NB Impacts includes both employee community service and the grant-making actions of the Neuberger Berman Foundation.[36] The Neuberger Berman Foundation offers grants focusing on at-risk children, youth educational programs, and economic sustainability.[37][38][39][40]
Neuberger Berman conducts an annual week-long program in the spring called “Celebration with Service,” which holds community service events in the cities where the firm has offices.[36][41][42] For its 75th anniversary year in 2014, the firm’s “Celebration with Service” supported 75 volunteer projects worldwide.[36] Since 2012, NB Impacts has deployed more than 4,500 volunteers to work with over 5,000 youth and 800 senior citizens, and also includes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours spent on improving parks and community spaces.[36][43] Through the years, some of the programs Neuberger Berman has been involved in are: The Y,[44] Homes for Heroes,[45] Per Scholas,[46] C-CAP,[47] New York City Service,[48][49] and Habitat for Humanity.[50]
Corporate art collection[edit]
Contemporary art in the workplace has been part of Neuberger Berman’s corporate culture since 1939, when renowned collector Roy Neuberger co-founded the investment firm.[51] In 1990 the firm began developing its own art collection.[52][53] The firm's corporate art collection was absorbed into the Lehman Brothers collection but Neuberger Berman repurchased many of them when the collection was sold at auction in 2010.[54] Today, the Neuberger Berman Collection supports the work of contemporary artists, prominently displaying their work in the firm’s hallways, reception areas and meeting rooms.[51] The collection creates a stimulating and enriching environment for both employees and visitors.

					Matter of Neuberger Berman Trust Co., N.A. 2016 NY Slip Op 32277(U) November 10, 2016 Surrogates's Court, New York County Docket Number: 1983-0735 D Judge: Nora S. Anderson Cases posted with a "30000" identifier, i.e., 2013 NY Slip Op 30001(U), are republished from various state and local government websites. These include the New York State Unified Court System's E-Courts Service, and the Bronx County Clerk's office. This opinion is uncorrected and not selected for official publication. [* 1] SURROGATE'S COURT: NEW YORK COUNTY ---------------------------------------------------------------)( In the Matter of the Application ofNeuberger Berman Trust Co., N.A., as Trustee of a Trust created by IRMA L. CROLL, Grantor, File No. 1983-0735 D Under Agreement dated November 24, 1970, for Judicial Settlement of its Account. -----------------------------------------------------------------)( -----------------------------------------------------------------)( In the Matter of the Application ofNeuberger Berman Trust Co., N.A., as Trustee of a Trust created by · IRMA L. CROLL, i Grantor, 'i File No. 1983-0735 E ' l 1 for the Benefit of Jane C. Wolfe, Seeking Judicial Settlement of its Account. -----------------------------------------------------------------)( -----------------------------------------------------------------)( In the Matter of the Application of Neuberger Berman Trust Co., N.A., as Executor of the Estate of IRMA L. CROLL File No. 1983-0735 F for Judicial Settlement of its Account. -----------------------------------------------------------------)( -----------------------------------------------------------------)( Neuberger Berman Trust Co., N.A., Plaintiff, -against- File No. 1983-0735 H Sarah J. Schlesinger, as Executor of the Estate of Edward S. Schlesinger, and Hofheimer Gartlir & Gross LLP, Defendants. -----------------------------------------------------------------)( ANDERS ON, S. In the above-captioned action and proceedings, the law firm of Hofheimer Garder & [* 2] Gross, LLP ("HGG") moves for a protective order staying the examination of a non-party witness. Neuberger Berman Trust Co. N.A. ("NB") cross-moves to compel HGG to comply with (1) a subpoena duces tecum and (2) this court's order dated June 19, 2015, directing HGG to produce its client files. NB also seeks an order pursuant to SCPA § 607 and CPLR § 2308 holding HGG in contempt for its alleged failure to comply with either the order or the subpoena . Three of the above-captioned proceedings (File No. 1983-0735 D,E,F) filed by NB seek judicial settlement of its accounts as executor of decedent's estate and as trustee of two inter vivos trusts. NB also brought an action for legal malpractice (File No. 1983-0735 H), transferred from Supreme Court, New York County, against defendants HGG and Edward S. Schlesinger ("Schlesinger"), a former partner at HGG. Background Decedent Irma Croll died in 2001. In her will, she named NB and Schlesinger as coexecutors of her estate; NB and Schlesinger were also co-trustees of her IV trust. HGG served as counsel to NB and Schlesinger in the administration of the estate and the trust. By letter dated December 9, 2011, counsel for three of the trust beneficiaries informed NB that the Generation Skipping Transfer ("GST") tax may have been incorrectly calculated on the federal estate tax return filed in 2003, resulting in a tax overpayment. After confirming that the estate had overpaid its taxes by $2.9 million, NB commenced the Supreme Court action transferred here against HGG and Schlesinger's estate. While not disputing the tax error, HGG moved to dismiss NB's malpractice claim as time-barred. Meanwhile, NB petitioned for judicial settlement of its accounts as co-executor and as co-trustee. When Schlesinger died on April 24, 2012, the fiduciary of his estate petitioned for judicial settlement of Schlesinger's account as co- 2 [* 3] trustee. HGG'S Motion for a Protective Order In November 2015, NB served a subpoena duces tecum and ad testificandum upon Jerry Persampieri, a certified public accountant who advised HGG in 2012 regarding the GST tax calculation. Mr. Persampieri produced the subpoenaed documents prior to his deposition, which was scheduled for January 22, 2016. However, on January 18, 2016, HGG filed the instant motion seeking to stay Mr. Persampieri's deposition until the court ruled on HGG's motion to dismiss the transferred action, and the beneficiaries completed their examination of NB in the accounting proceedings. On March 22, 2016, HGG's motion for a protective order was denied as moot in light of this court's contemporaneous denial of HGG's motion to dismiss. To the extent that HGG seeks to stay the deposition until after NB's examination in the accounting proceedings, HGG fails to explain why the examination of Mr. Persampieri at this juncture would prejudice any party to those proceedings. NB is entitled to go forward with its examination of Mr. Persampieri on issues relevant to its malpractice claims. NB's Cross-Motion NB's cross-motion seeks to compel the production of two categories of documents. The first category consists of HGG's client files. In 2014, NB amended its complaint to add a claim of replevin to recover possession of the files. On June 19, 2015, the court ordered HGG to produce the files (the "2015 order"). NB alleges that HGG did not fully comply with the 2015 order, as demonstrated by the lack of e-mails or other electronically stored information ("ESI") in the files already produced. The second category consists of documents requested by NB in a subpoena duces tecum served upon HGG pertaining to legal work performed by HGG for the estate and/or the trust, 3 [* 4] including documents pertaining to HGG's 2012 inquiry into the accuracy of the GST tax. NB alleges that HGG has failed to comply with the subpoena. The two categories of documents largely overlap. NB insists that it needs the documents in order to "narrow the issues" and to determine whether HGG and Schlesinger concealed the GST tax error. HGG asserts that its files did not contain any ESI created prior to August 2005. In response, NB points to deposition testimony ofHGG's former information technology partner as evidence that HGG maintained email systems and servers dating back to 2002. However, the partner testified that, although he was able to locate the e-mail archives of Schlesinger and of another HGG attorney who worked on the estate and trust matters, he was unable to access theemails themselves. Second, HGG maintains that it did not search for post-August 2005 ESI because, by that time, it no longer represented NB and Schlesinger as fiduciaries. NB contends that HGG's representation continued until some time in 2012. Third, HGG argues that it is not required to produce documents created after December 9, 2011, because, on that date, counsel for the beneficiaries first raised concerns over the GST tax, at which point HGG "became the object of a potential malpractice claim." HGG asserts that all documents created after that date constitute work-product prepared in anticipation oflitigation. NB counters that HGG cannot reasonably have anticipated litigation simply based on the letter from beneficiaries' counsel, which merely requested an explanation as to how the tax was calculated and noted their inability to "reconcile the numbers." NB asserts that it was not until May 2012, when NB and HGG received another letter from the beneficiaries' counsel pointing to 4 [* 5] the incorrect GST calculation and directing NB and HGG to preserve all relevant documents, that HGG had a reasonable basis for anticipating litigation. In support of its claim that HGG was still acting as its counsel during March and April of 2012, NB submits e-mails between NB and HGG during that time regarding the tax calculation. However, those e-mails merely demonstrate a joint effort to respond to the beneficiaries' inquiry and do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that HGG was still representing NB. After receiving the first letter from beneficiaries' counsel, HGG could have reasonably anticipated that it might be subject to liability on the tax issue. Therefore, the court cannot discount the possibility that an otherwise responsive document generated after December 9, 2011, might be deemed privileged. The court directs HGG to produce all documents and ESI that are either responsive to the subpoena duces tecum or subject to the court's 2015 order. To the extent that HGG withholds any document on the ground that it is privileged, it must submit a privilege log containing the identifying information set forth in CPLR 3122(b ). HGG is further directed to submit a detailed affidavit describing its efforts to search for any responsive ESI generated after decedent's death in 2001. The affidavit must state whether any such electronic documents exist and, to the extent that they are inaccessible, an explanation as to why that is so. If HGG takes the position that, with respect to a particular time period, it is not possible to determine whether any documents, including ESI, still exist, HGG's affirmation must provide a thorough and accurate explanation for such conclusion. NB's Cross-Motion for Contempt Contempt is a "drastic remedy rarely used in the context of ordinary discovery disputes" (Lopez v New York City Tr. Auth., 85 AD3 543 [1st Dept 2011]). In order to prevail on a motion 5 [* 6] for civil contempt, the movant must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the party has intentionally engaged in conduct that violated an order containing an unequivocal and explicit mandate (Bernard-Cadet v Gobin, 94 AD3d 1030, 1031 [2d Dept 2012]; Miller v Miller, 61 AD3d 651 [2d Dept 2009]). HOG turned over several boxes of documents shortly after the court issued its 2015 order. In response to the subpoena, HOG informed NB that HOG did not have any responsive documents and that, in any event, documents created after December 9, 2011, were attorney workproduct. Moreover, after being served with the subpoena, HOG produced a former HOG partner for an examination on the firm's ESI retention policies. It cannot be concluded that HGG's response to either the 2015 order or NB' s subpoena rose to the level of contempt. Thus, the motion for contempt is denied, as is NB' s request for legal fees and costs . • This decision constitutes the order of the court. SURitOGATE Dated: l.nJfJMly- /O, 2016 6

Founded in 1939,[3] Neuberger Berman is a privately held asset management firm, which is 100%[4][5] owned by its employees. It serves pension plans, charitable organizations, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions, as well as high-net-worth individuals and mutual fund investors, both directly and through financial intermediaries and other partners. The firm has a broad range of investment capabilities, which have enabled it to win numerous public strategic partnership mandates, most notably from Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the National Social Security Fund of China.[6] For its private clients, Neuberger Berman also provides financial planning, fiduciary services, and trust services. Known as a firm of investors, the firm has maintained a 97% retention rate among its senior investment teams since 2009,[7] and has been recognized for its distinctive firm culture.[8][9]
History[edit]
Neuberger Berman was founded as "Neuberger & Berman" in 1939, by Roy R. Neuberger and Robert Berman.
In the decades that followed its founding, the firm's growth mirrored that of the asset-management industry as a whole. Its success in managing separate accounts, led it to establish the Guardian Fund, in 1950, one of the first no-load mutual funds in the United States. Today, the firm’s complex of open and closed-end mutual funds, includes other well-known funds, including Century Fund (renamed Large Cap Disciplined Growth Fund) and Genesis Fund. In the 1960s, the firm expanded into the management of pension plans and assets of other institutions.

After 60 years as a private firm, in October 1999, Neuberger Berman conducted an initial public offering of its shares and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol "NEU". With the firm's IPO, Larry Zicklin, who had joined the firm in 1969, retired as Chairman of its executive committee. He was succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by Jeffrey B. Lane.
Lehman Brothers acquisition and bankruptcy[edit]
In July 2003, shortly after the retired Mr. Neuberger's 100th birthday, the company announced that it was in merger discussions with Lehman Brothers. These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm's acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities, or approximately 26 times earnings.[10] That transaction closed in October 2003 and from that time, until 2008, Neuberger Berman served as one of the asset management arms of Lehman Brothers’ Investment Management Division. In that same year, Lehman acquired fixed income manager Lincoln Capital Fixed Income Management and private equity manager Crossroads Group.[11]
Management Buyout[edit]
On September 15, 2008, virtually unprecedented volatility in global securities markets resulted in Lehman Brothers’ collapse and bankruptcy filing. Neuberger Berman continued to operate, notwithstanding Lehman’s bankruptcy and sought opportunities to spin itself off from its parent. On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell its asset management businesses, including Neuberger Berman, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman & Friedman. The transaction was expected to close in early 2009;[12] however, a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction held on December 3, topping the deal with Bain and Hellman.[13] The firm spun itself off in May 2009, in a transaction recognized by Fund Industry Intelligence as Deal of the Year.[14] Lehman Brothers' creditors initially retained a 49% common equity interest in the firm and a $875 million preferred equity stake.[13] with a coupon that climbed to 12% over three years. The preferred equity position was fully repaid in 2012.[15][16] The new entity, including Neuberger, Lincoln Capital, and Crossroads, was named Neuberger Berman Group LLC.[17] Under employee control, Larry Zicklin rejoined the firm as a member of the Board of Directors. Lehman Brothers creditors have received over $1.5 billion from the employees of Neuberger Berman, dwarfing the proceeds paid by Barclays and Nomura for businesses representing 90% of Lehman Brothers employees.[18]
Independence and Expansion[edit]
Since its reemergence as an independent firm, Neuberger Berman has enjoyed a period of sustained growth. The firm increased its assets under management 14% per year from 2010 to 2014,[19] reaching $250 billion,[20] which placed the firm at the top of its peer group by asset growth.[19] The firm currently employs approximately 2,000 people,[20] and has expanded beyond its traditional equity focus into the growing areas of emerging markets debt,[21] high-yield bonds,[22] liquid alternatives and private equity,[23][24] among other strategies. During this period the firm expanded its global presence, adding coverage offices in key Asia-Pacific markets and elsewhere to be closer to a growing overseas client base.[25]
The end of 2014 marked Neuberger Berman’s return to full employee ownership, highlighting the firm’s independence and clearing the path for future growth.[26][27] Employee ownership has been recognized by industry leaders as a key factor in the success of asset management firms, and Neuberger Berman’s position as an employee-owned firm is cited as a reason for its high talent retention rate.[28] In recognition of its culture, Neuberger Berman won the top rank in its category on Pensions & Investments' 2016 Best Places to Work in Money Management survey,[2] and had been named to the Best Places list in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[29][30][31]
Offices[edit]




1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York City.


In October 2016, the firm moved its global headquarters to 1290 Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan.[32][33]
In addition, the firm has approximately 28 other offices in key countries around the world. Regional headquarters are in Hong Kong, London and Tokyo, and has additional primary portfolio management centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, The Hague and Singapore.[34][33]
Former headquarters in New York City include 605 Third Avenue,[32] 522 Fifth Avenue and, originally, The Biltmore Hotel.[35]
Philanthropy[edit]
Collectively, Neuberger Berman’s philanthropic efforts are called NB Impacts. NB Impacts includes both employee community service and the grant-making actions of the Neuberger Berman Foundation.[36] The Neuberger Berman Foundation offers grants focusing on at-risk children, youth educational programs, and economic sustainability.[37][38][39][40]
Neuberger Berman conducts an annual week-long program in the spring called “Celebration with Service,” which holds community service events in the cities where the firm has offices.[36][41][42] For its 75th anniversary year in 2014, the firm’s “Celebration with Service” supported 75 volunteer projects worldwide.[36] Since 2012, NB Impacts has deployed more than 4,500 volunteers to work with over 5,000 youth and 800 senior citizens, and also includes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours spent on improving parks and community spaces.[36][43] Through the years, some of the programs Neuberger Berman has been involved in are: The Y,[44] Homes for Heroes,[45] Per Scholas,[46] C-CAP,[47] New York City Service,[48][49] and Habitat for Humanity.[50]
Corporate art collection[edit]
Contemporary art in the workplace has been part of Neuberger Berman’s corporate culture since 1939, when renowned collector Roy Neuberger co-founded the investment firm.[51] In 1990 the firm began developing its own art collection.[52][53] The firm's corporate art collection was absorbed into the Lehman Brothers collection but Neuberger Berman repurchased many of them when the collection was sold at auction in 2010.[54] Today, the Neuberger Berman Collection supports the work of contemporary artists, prominently displaying their work in the firm’s hallways, reception areas and meeting rooms.[51] The collection creates a stimulating and enriching environment for both employees and visitors.

Overview[edit]
Founded in 1939,[3] Neuberger Berman is a privately held asset management firm, which is 100%[4][5] owned by its employees. It serves pension plans, charitable organizations, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions, as well as high-net-worth individuals and mutual fund investors, both directly and through financial intermediaries and other partners. The firm has a broad range of investment capabilities, which have enabled it to win numerous public strategic partnership mandates, most notably from Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the National Social Security Fund of China.[6] For its private clients, Neuberger Berman also provides financial planning, fiduciary services, and trust services. Known as a firm of investors, the firm has maintained a 97% retention rate among its senior investment teams since 2009,[7] and has been recognized for its distinctive firm culture.[8][9]
History[edit]
Neuberger Berman was founded as "Neuberger & Berman" in 1939, by Roy R. Neuberger and Robert Berman.
In the decades that followed its founding, the firm's growth mirrored that of the asset-management industry as a whole. Its success in managing separate accounts, led it to establish the Guardian Fund, in 1950, one of the first no-load mutual funds in the United States. Today, the firm’s complex of open and closed-end mutual funds, includes other well-known funds, including Century Fund (renamed Large Cap Disciplined Growth Fund) and Genesis Fund. In the 1960s, the firm expanded into the management of pension plans and assets of other institutions.




Pre-Lehman bankruptcy logo


After 60 years as a private firm, in October 1999, Neuberger Berman conducted an initial public offering of its shares and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol "NEU". With the firm's IPO, Larry Zicklin, who had joined the firm in 1969, retired as Chairman of its executive committee. He was succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by Jeffrey B. Lane.

In July 2003, shortly after the retired Mr. Neuberger's 100th birthday, the company announced that it was in merger discussions with Lehman Brothers. These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm's acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities, or approximately 26 times earnings.[10] That transaction closed in October 2003 and from that time, until 2008, Neuberger Berman served as one of the asset management arms of Lehman Brothers’ Investment Management Division. In that same year, Lehman acquired fixed income manager Lincoln Capital Fixed Income Management and private equity manager Crossroads Group.[11]
Management Buyout[edit]
On September 15, 2008, virtually unprecedented volatility in global securities markets resulted in Lehman Brothers’ collapse and bankruptcy filing. Neuberger Berman continued to operate, notwithstanding Lehman’s bankruptcy and sought opportunities to spin itself off from its parent. On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell its asset management businesses, including Neuberger Berman, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman & Friedman. The transaction was expected to close in early 2009;[12] however, a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction held on December 3, topping the deal with Bain and Hellman.[13] The firm spun itself off in May 2009, in a transaction recognized by Fund Industry Intelligence as Deal of the Year.[14] Lehman Brothers' creditors initially retained a 49% common equity interest in the firm and a $875 million preferred equity stake.[13] with a coupon that climbed to 12% over three years. The preferred equity position was fully repaid in 2012.[15][16] The new entity, including Neuberger, Lincoln Capital, and Crossroads, was named Neuberger Berman Group LLC.[17] Under employee control, Larry Zicklin rejoined the firm as a member of the Board of Directors. Lehman Brothers creditors have received over $1.5 billion from the employees of Neuberger Berman, dwarfing the proceeds paid by Barclays and Nomura for businesses representing 90% of Lehman Brothers employees.[18]
Independence and Expansion[edit]
Since its reemergence as an independent firm, Neuberger Berman has enjoyed a period of sustained growth. The firm increased its assets under management 14% per year from 2010 to 2014,[19] reaching $250 billion,[20] which placed the firm at the top of its peer group by asset growth.[19] The firm currently employs approximately 2,000 people,[20] and has expanded beyond its traditional equity focus into the growing areas of emerging markets debt,[21] high-yield bonds,[22] liquid alternatives and private equity,[23][24] among other strategies. During this period the firm expanded its global presence, adding coverage offices in key Asia-Pacific markets and elsewhere to be closer to a growing overseas client base.[25]
The end of 2014 marked Neuberger Berman’s return to full employee ownership, highlighting the firm’s independence and clearing the path for future growth.[26][27] Employee ownership has been recognized by industry leaders as a key factor in the success of asset management firms, and Neuberger Berman’s position as an employee-owned firm is cited as a reason for its high talent retention rate.[28] In recognition of its culture, Neuberger Berman won the top rank in its category on Pensions & Investments' 2016 Best Places to Work in Money Management survey,[2] and had been named to the Best Places list in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[29][30][31]
Offices[edit]




1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York City.


In October 2016, the firm moved its global headquarters to 1290 Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan.[32][33]
In addition, the firm has approximately 28 other offices in key countries around the world. Regional headquarters are in Hong Kong, London and Tokyo, and has additional primary portfolio management centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, The Hague and Singapore.[34][33]
Former headquarters in New York City include 605 Third Avenue,[32] 522 Fifth Avenue and, originally, The Biltmore Hotel.[35]
Philanthropy[edit]
Collectively, Neuberger Berman’s philanthropic efforts are called NB Impacts. NB Impacts includes both employee community service and the grant-making actions of the Neuberger Berman Foundation.[36] The Neuberger Berman Foundation offers grants focusing on at-risk children, youth educational programs, and economic sustainability.[37][38][39][40]
Neuberger Berman conducts an annual week-long program in the spring called “Celebration with Service,” which holds community service events in the cities where the firm has offices.[36][41][42] For its 75th anniversary year in 2014, the firm’s “Celebration with Service” supported 75 volunteer projects worldwide.[36] Since 2012, NB Impacts has deployed more than 4,500 volunteers to work with over 5,000 youth and 800 senior citizens, and also includes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours spent on improving parks and community spaces.[36][43] Through the years, some of the programs Neuberger Berman has been involved in are: The Y,[44] Homes for Heroes,[45] Per Scholas,[46] C-CAP,[47] New York City Service,[48][49] and Habitat for Humanity.[50]
Corporate art collection[edit]
Contemporary art in the workplace has been part of Neuberger Berman’s corporate culture since 1939, when renowned collector Roy Neuberger co-founded the investment firm.[51] In 1990 the firm began developing its own art collection.[52][53] The firm's corporate art collection was absorbed into the Lehman Brothers collection but Neuberger Berman repurchased many of them when the collection was sold at auction in 2010.[54] Today, the Neuberger Berman Collection supports the work of contemporary artists, prominently displaying their work in the firm’s hallways, reception areas and meeting rooms.[51] The collection creates a stimulating and enriching environment for both employees and visitors.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
