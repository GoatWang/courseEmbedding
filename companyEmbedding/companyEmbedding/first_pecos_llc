This funding is instrumental as it gives the Company a clear bridge to clinical data. This agreement also helps us remove a financial overhang and provides an opportunity for our shareholders to participate in future offerings while minimizing dilution. This path forward will give the Company a feasible financing plan into late 2018."  Saverio La Francesca, M.D., Biostage's President and Chief Medical Officer, commented, "First Pecos has been a Biostage investor for the past three years. Through many interactions over the course of this period, I have been impressed by their interest in and understanding of our technology, and importantly, their belief in the potential Biostage has to provide an important solution to the unserved patient population we are aiming to address. Their long-term commitment to Biostage, by helping us advance our technology to the clinic, is clearly demonstrated by this MOU."  The proceeds of the private placement will be used toward the advancement of the Company's development programs, including the Cellspan™ Esophageal Implant, as well as the filing of the Company's Investigational New Drug ("IND") application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and the Company's pivot to a clinical-stage company with the commencement of its first-in-human clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2017.To the extent the transaction would result in Pecos and its affiliates owning more than 19.9% of the Company's common stock at the time of closing, they will instead receive shares of a new class of convertible preferred stock, which will automatically convert into shares of common stock upon approval of the Company's stockholders. Such approval will be sought at the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders. Until conversion, the convertible preferred stock will have a cumulative annual dividend of 15%. Similarly, to the extent exercise of the warrants would result in Pecos and its affiliates owning more than 19.9% of the Company's common stock at the time of exercise, the warrants will instead be exercisable into shares of the new class of preferred stock.Read MoreBiostage has agreed to grant board representation and nomination rights to Pecos, which will be proportional (rounded up or down to the nearest whole number) to the percentage of the Company's common stock owned by Pecos and its affiliates.The private placement is conditioned on satisfaction of customary closing conditions and on the Company terminating its Shareholder Rights Plan, and must be consummated on or prior to August 15, 2017.
