Associated Bank National Association

                    Associated Bank, as we know it today, is the result of many mergers and acquisitions. The roots of our founding banks run deep in our communities.

The Neenah-based bank is the oldest branch of our family tree dating back to 1861.

Another key event in Associated’s history was the merger of First Financial and Associated Bank in 1997, retaining the name of the latter. First Financial was a consolidation of many mostly Wisconsin based Thrifts and Savings and Loan banks.

At Associated, we’re proud to have a legacy of service to our customers and communities that spans more than 150 years!
