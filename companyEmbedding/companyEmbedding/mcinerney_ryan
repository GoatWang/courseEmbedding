GRAND RAPIDS, MI – East Grand Rapids native Ryan McInerney has been named president of Visa Inc., succeeding John Partridge who is retiring, the credit card giant announced Thursday, May 23.
McInerney, a 1993 graduate of East Grand Rapids High School, had been chief executive of consumer banking at JP Morgan Chase and also served on J.P. Morgan Chase's executive committee.
In his new role, McInerney will be responsible for Visa's global client organization, product management as well as a new solutions group, which will focus on building and bringing to market new products and services to Visa's issuer, acquirer and merchant clients. He will report to Charlie Scharf, chief executive of Visa Inc. 
"I have worked closely with Ryan for many years and know him to have extensive payments knowledge, be a tremendous leader and a great executive capable of motivating and managing large groups of people. I am confident he will be a great fit and asset to the organization," said Scharf  in a news release. 
"As Visa seeks to find new ways to partner with and add value to our clients, I believe Ryan's client focus and deep understanding of the industry will be invaluable."
"I am thrilled to join an incredible company at such an exciting time,” McInerney said in the news release. “As the global leader in payments, Visa has helped its clients tremendously by driving the global migration to electronic payments.  I look forward to working with the Visa team to prepare for the many opportunities ahead and finding new ways to help our partners grow their businesses.”
McInerney, who married his childhood sweetheart, Angela Sebastian, and went on to graduate from the University of Notre Dame, told Mlive.com last year that his high school experience was critical to his success in the business world.
“Growing up in Grand Rapids is a really important part of who I am,” said McInerney, who played football, lacrosse and competed on the high school’s ski team.”
“It was a fabulous academic environment,” McInerney said of his years at East Grand Rapids High School. “When I was there, the faculty was great. It pushed us really hard to develop.”
McInerney, 36,  joins Visa from JP Morgan Chase where he was the CEO of Consumer Banking, a banking network with 5,600 branches, more than 75,000 employees and approximately $14 billion in revenue. 
Previously, McInerney held several senior positions at JP Morgan Chase including roles in operations, risk management, product management and marketing.  He also served on the company's executive committee. 
Prior to joining JP Morgan Chase, Ryan was a principal at McKinsey & Company in the firm's retail banking and payments practices.
