SRI International Spins Off Superflex, Inc. to  Help People Achieve Their Physical Potential





Menlo Park, Calif. – April 21, 2016 – SRI International today announced the launch of Superflex,Inc., its newest spin-off venture. Superflex will develop cutting-edge wearable robotics to enhance the human musculoskeletal system for a wide range of applications. Superflex technology was originally developed for the DARPA-funded ‘Warrior Web’ program to enhance soldier performance, reduce injury risk and increase the weight of equipment that soldiers could carry.
“SRI has always operated at the epicenter of global robotics innovation, while solving some of the toughest technological challenges, and the evolution of Superflex is a great demonstration of those capabilities,” said Manish Kothari, Ph.D., president of SRI Ventures. “The spin-off of Superflex is a testament to SRI’s immensely talented and productive robotics team.”  
The new venture will be led by Rich Mahoney, Ph.D., who is returning to his roots in early stage commercialization of robotics after more than 7 years as the director of SRI Robotics. 
Superflex expects to announce its product focus by the end of the year.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Zoro, Inc has received 4.32 out of 5 stars based on 37 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Michelle Garcia Winner

Problems are a part of life. When we're around others, it's expected that the size of our reaction matches the size of the problem. When we have big reactions to little problems, people may feel uncomfortable. We may even be creating more problems for ourselves! The Size of My Problem poster can be used on the spot to help individuals figure out the size of a problem, their reaction size, and then visually see the relationship between them. Perfect for home or classroom/clinic. Dry-erase surface for use again and again.

New & Noteworthy Research

        Social Thinking was originally developed as an intervention and assessment framework dedicated to tackling the complex social emotional learning needs of individuals with social learning challenges. At its inception 20 years ago, there were relatively few treatment-based research studies available to guide interventionists in how to teach individuals about their own social learning process. This relative lack of treatment research, while not as bleak today, continues to be limited. The underlying motivation for the creation of the Social Thinking methodology was, and is, that individuals with social learning issues should have access to interventions and strategies based on both individual learning abilities and the demands of the community within which they participate. 






Thinking Socially: Teaching Social Knowledge to Foster Social Behavioral Change
Pamela J. Crooke, Michelle Garcia Winner, and Lesley B. Olswang

                This article discusses the Social Emotional Chain Reaction (as taught in Social Behavior Mapping); the idea that how we act affects how others feel, how we make others feel affects how they treat us, how we are treated affects how we feel about others and ultimately how we feel about ourselves. The Social Emotional Chain Reaction is at the foundation of social interaction and is at the heart of what we teach through the Social Thinking Methodology.

”
Nadine, SLP
I love how realistic the approach is, and doable!!Based on real clinical experience, adaptable to individual needs/strengths. Great that all the vocabulary is simple, easy to understand, and not full of professional 'shop talk'.


”
Katie Roe, SLP
I have a 13 yr old son with autism and 11 year old with some behaviors and ADHD. I can't possibly write down how much I have learned from the Social Thinking conference. It should be against the law not to attend a Michelle Garcia Winner conference


”
Crystal Hansen, School Psychologist
Social Thinking is the philosophy that I ascribe to professionally. It serves as my guide through assessment and intervention


”
Katie Roe, SLP
This was the best conference I have been to in my 9 years. I cannot wait to get back to school and start using all of the materials/ strategies. I cannot wait to come back next year!

Louise Sanguine, OT

Description



Superflex®: A Superhero Social Thinking Curriculum provides educators, parents and therapists fun and motivating ways to teach students with social and communication difficulties (undiagnosed or diagnosed, such as Asperger’s syndrome, ADHD, high-functioning autism or similar). The three-part cognitive behavioral curriculum helps students develop further awareness of their own thinking and social behaviors and learn strategies to help them develop better self-regulation across a range of behaviors.
 
The Superflex Curriculum Package Includes
 

The Superflex Curriculum: 106 page book to guide adults in teaching the core concepts.
All handouts and relevant teaching materials on a CD/USB drive included with the book.
Superflex Takes on Rock Brain and the Team of Unthinkables, a 21-page comic book which introduces the basic Unthinkable characters through which we teach the curriculum.
When should you use the Superflex Curriculum: Teachers, parents  and therapists should only use Superflex after the core concepts introduced in the book You Are A Social Detective (a different product) are thoroughly taught to the student.
Ages: The curriculum is geared to elementary school children (grades 2nd-5th) but can be used  with immature older students who respond to visual books.

 






IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT TEACHING SUPERFLEX:  Teachers, parents  and therapists should only use Superflex after the core concepts introduced in the book You Are A Social Detective are thoroughly taught to the student.
 
The Superflex curriculum book offers clear lesson plans to help educators, SLPs, other therapists and parents create a personalized Superflex Superhero Training Academy for their students. Students learn they each have a Superflex superflexible thinking superhero inside their brains. Superflex helps them take on the Team of Unthinkables (Rock Brain, Topic Twister Meister, Mean Jean and Glassman to name a few), cartoon-like characters who embody different behaviors and challenges. For instance, Rock Brain makes people get stuck on their own ideas, or Glassman makes them have huge upset reactions. Each of the 14 characters’ powers are described and teaching materials include specific strategies that can help students subdue the Unthinkable that is invading their brain. You can even print cards, Superflex award badges and handouts included in the curriculum.
 
The Superflex Comic Book
The Superflex Curriculum package includes a colorfully illustrated 21-page storybook, Superflex Takes on Rock Brain and the Team of Unthinkables. This book tells the story of how Superflex came to be. The children enter Superflex's town, Social Town, and learn about the cast of sneaky Unthinkables who are trying to overtake and rid the town of Superflex forever. Superflex and his sidekick dog, Bark, go on their first mission to try to save the citizens of Social Town.

Why this Curriculum Has Been So Successful
Children with HFA, Asperger's, ADHD and other social emotional learning challenges have difficulty regulating their own behaviors in the moment. Superflex provides a fun forum in which they can explore their challenges and identify ways to modify their thoughts and related behaviors in different settings. Depicting behaviors as comic book characters helps students learn about their own behaviors in a non-threatening way,  while the superhero Superflex helps build the thinking required to regulate those behaviors. Superflex empowers and motivates students to help themselves--reducing meltdowns and anxiety as the students discover and develop their own inner superhero.
 
Good social skills can be defined as considering other people and "adapting efficiently in each context." To do this we have to read the hidden social rules in each social situation and then regulate our physical presence, eyes, language, emotions, and reactions.
 
This requires highly flexible thinking. While some children learn to do this somewhat effortlessly, many students, even advanced, so-called normal-thinking students, have challenges in recognizing and applying these concepts that are at the heart of social cooperation and social problem solving. "Social smarts" only occur when students incorporate all this information and regulate their bodies and minds to show they can effectively adapt to others across environmental contexts. 
 
Students who do not learn this information intuitively, but who function with emerging language-thinking skills, need to be taught these core concepts more explicitly. Superflex and the Team of Unthinkables help students understand and become more aware of their own thinking and behaviors: when they are using their  social smarts versus when their brains are getting sidetracked in less positive and social ways. The different Unthinkables help them zoom in on what challenge they may be facing in the moment and the strategies help them learn to overcome that Unthinkable’s powers. Kids enjoy being superheroes in training, flexing and building their social thinking and social skills.
 
How is Superflex Taught?
Superflex was designed to be used only after students have been introduced to the Social Thinking concepts included in our children’s book You are a Social Detective and they have worked through related activities from our book, Think Social: A Social Thinking Curriculum for School Age Students (Winner, 2005). This gives our learners a good foundation in being a social thinker and Social Detective so they get the most out of using Superflex.
 
The Superflex Curriculum book is to be read in smaller sections to students. It will take several days of reading 20 minutes at a time or so, depending on the level of social thinking and social learning challenges in your students. 
 
We introduce the concepts of Superflex and the Team of Unthinkables through a series of lessons. We start by talking about how the brain works, how social information is part of the brain, how we can change our behavior, what our brain is expected to do socially (Superflex) and then the thoughts that challenge our brains from doing our best (the Unthinkables). Each lesson stands on its own.and each lesson may take multiple sessions to teach so that kids grasp what we’re teaching and can begin to integrate into their own thinking and behavior. 
 
There is no “finish line” for working on these concepts. Once they are introduced within the 15 or so lessons included, the next step is to help students continue to use the vocabulary and strategies during real-time situations and interactions. It’s one thing to talk about Glassman as part of a lesson; it’s much more challenging for students to 1) identify when Glassman thinking is invading his or her brain, 2) think about the situation and how the student’s behavior is affecting others, and 3) employ one or more of the strategies taugh in the Superflex Curriculum!  
 
While the lessons should be taught at a discrete time (20-40 minutes), the application of the lessons is 24/7 in teachable moments. The teacher will want to reinforce how often kids’ Superflex and their superflexible social thinking is showing up, rather than just talk about when the Unthinkables are lurking about. More on how to teach is explained in the curriculum. 
 
Superflex is ME and YOU, and YOU, too!
Superflex was created to help students understand more about their own flexible and not-so-flexible thinking. We can all relate on some level to imagining what it would be like to be a superhero or how much fun it would be to have superpowers. In teaching the Superflex curriculum, we want students to learn that Superflex is unique to each individual and is active when we're thinking flexibly. There's not one gender or ethnicity for Superflex. My Superflex will look like me, yours like you, and a teacher's Superflex will look like the teacher! In our books and materials, we visually portray Aiden's Superflex, so he's male. But Superflex can be tall, short, light-skinned, dark-skinned, male, or female.

Be sure in teaching Superflex that you convey this concept to your students so they are not confused and think that Superflex is only a male superhero. Superflex is YOU!

 
How Superflex Connects to the Larger Social Thinking Methodology
Superflex is just one of many products we use with students to build their social thinking abilities. A more comprehensive two-book curriculum, Social Thinking and Me (Winner and Murphy, 2016) is designed for students in 4–7th grade to read as they engage in social emotional learning in treatment groups, inclusion based classrooms and/or at home. This set provides explicit instruction to help our students develop some of the information they need to create and strengthen their superflexible abilities and defeat the Unthinkables.

What People are Saying



”
Betty R. Stockton - Behavior Intervention Consultant
"Visiting a foreign country is full of challenges for the person who does not speak the language or know the customs. The hurdle is much the same every day for persons who have social thinking problems, such as those with Asperger's Syndrome. The teacher, parent, or other provider can find in Superflex® a vehicle for explaining those invisible thoughts that 'get in the way' of getting along."


”
Ann S. Meuel - SLP
"Superflex® is absolutely brilliant. My students are thoroughly enjoying the process of exploring their own world through the events and discussions we have had regarding Social Town and the Team of Unthinkables. From the very first therapy session I introduced Superflex, my students related to the characters and were able to openly and honestly discuss their own Team of Unthinkables in an extremely nonthreatening and meaningful manner."


”
Ben - 5 year old superhero 
"Everyday Rock Brain shakes my brain before I do something bad. It feels kind of like a shift– vibration then it stops. That is when he tells me to do something unexpected. Superflex® comes in and does a special kick to Rock Brain. Rock Brain goes flying out and he pops and that’s it. Sometimes I ignore Rock Brain when my brain starts to shake. Sometimes that’s easy, sometimes that’s hard.”
