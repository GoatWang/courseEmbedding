 Horton Capital Home.
Homes For Everyone








Terry Horton


                       Terry Horton also co-founded D.R. Horton, Inc. in 1978 with his brother, Don Horton.  D.R. Horton, Inc. achieved positive cash flow in the first four months and delivered 117 homes with a $2.8 million net profit in the first year.   In 2006, D.R. Horton closed over 250,000 homes and generated in excess of $18 Billion in revenue.  Terry served as President of the DFW Division from 1981-2000 and was a member of the Board of Directors from 1992-2002. 
In 2001, Terry and his son, Trent, formed Horton Capital Partners, LLC.  The partnership has been involved with several projects from Texas to Florida to Hawaii.  Notably, in 2005, the partnership invested $1.2 Million to assemble 1,700 acres in the town of McKinney, one of the fastest growing communities in Texas. The partnership planned, engineered, and entitled 4,500 units.  The property sold in 2007 for $16.8 Million.  In 2006, the corporation became a financial partner in the luxurious Texas Hill Country community of Escondido.  Escondido has been recognized as the best selling golf course community in Texas and was awarded the best new course in Texas by The Dallas Morning News.  Additionally, Golf Week named Escondido among the top 100 Best Residential Golf Courses in 2010, nationwide.
Key to Terry’s success is involvement in the cost aspect of business ventures.  He has been profitable on every home under his management and subsequently every business endeavor he has undertaken.  His in-depth understanding of the cost side of each business is the foundation for strategic business plans that yield profitable results.
Prior to entering the homebuilding industry, Terry built and operated the Medicare Pharmacy in his hometown of Marshall, Arkansas from 1974-1978.  He borrowed 100% of the funds to build, accessorize, and stock the pharmacy.  The business was profitable in six months; and, all debt was paid off in eighteen months.
Terry obtained a Doctor of Pharmacy degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1973.  He also attended the University of Central Arkansas from 1967-1969.
Mr. Horton is currently an owner of Endeavor Wall Homes, Inc. and serves on the Board of Directors for the World Evangelism Fellowship, a group that is involved in water well development in third world countries.  Additionally, he is involved in the President’s Council of “A Defining Moment” which helps with AIDS education and treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa. He formerly served on the Board of Governors for The Vaquero Club (2002-2005) and on the International Mission Board (1988 – 1996).  Terry became an ordained Southern Baptist Deacon in 1978.
