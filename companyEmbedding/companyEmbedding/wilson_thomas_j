Tom Wilson
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The Allstate Corporation

Tom Wilson, 58, is the chairman and chief executive officer of The Allstate Corporation. Wilson has served as CEO of Allstate since 2007 and became chairman of The Allstate Corporation's Board of Directors in 2008.
Wilson has held a number of senior executive positions at Allstate since 1995. As CEO, Wilson has led a multi-year transformation of Allstate to position it as the only insurer with differentiated brands targeted at each segment of the market. The emphasis has been not only on doing the right things, such as investing in cutting-edge innovation, improving efficiency and productivity, and shedding non-core assets, but in doing them in the right way — optimizing the pace of change, restructuring for the long term rather than the short term, honoring commitments to employees, agency owners, customers and communities, and investing in the people of Allstate. 
He joined Allstate in 1995 from Sears, Roebuck and Co. where he was vice president of strategy and analysis. He was managing director of mergers and acquisitions at Dean Witter Reynolds from 1986 to 1993 and held various financial positions at the Amoco Corporation from 1980 to 1986.
 Wilson is the vice chair of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and holds active leadership positions within the financial services industry and the community. He is a board member of State Street Corporation and the Financial Services Roundtable. He is also a member the Property and Casualty CEO Roundtable and the Financial Services Forum, as well as the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago. Wilson regularly offers comment and insight about timely business and policy topics in national media outlets, and his articles have been published in the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN.com.
Wilson is a trustee of Rush University Medical Center. He is committed to empowering youth and serves as the national and Illinois co-chair for WE Day. Wilson is also the co-chair of Get In Chicago, the public-private partnership to reduce violent crime among youth in Chicago. He has previously served as chairman of the Property and Casualty CEO Roundtable, chairman of the Financial Services Roundtable and deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
A native of St. Clair Shores, Michigan, Wilson holds an MBA from Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Michigan.


Matt Winter
President, The Allstate Corporation
Chief Executive Officer, Allstate Life Insurance Company

Matthew Winter is president of The Allstate Corporation and chief executive officer of Allstate Life Insurance Company. Winter leads the Allstate Personal Lines (APL) business. APL includes the complete range of Allstate-brand property-casualty and life insurance products offered to consumers through Allstate agencies and Allstate independent agencies. He is responsible for all business operations and distribution within APL, which includes the 15 field offices located across the United States and in Canada.
Winter joined Allstate in 2009 as president and CEO of Allstate Financial. In 2011, he moved to the property-casualty side of the business and has taken on expanded responsibilities each year since. In 2012, he was named president of Allstate Auto, Home and Agencies. In the following year, the business unit changed to Allstate Personal Lines when it expanded to include consumer household lines (boat, motorcycle, renters, etc.). In 2014, the life insurance business was added to APL and Winter was promoted to president of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company.
Before joining Allstate, Winter held numerous senior executive positions at large financial institutions and insurance providers. He served as vice chairman of American International Group, where he was responsible for a number of business units with global reach. He also served as president and CEO for AIG's American General domestic life companies, which included AIG's expansive North American life insurance operations. Earlier in his insurance career, Winter was executive vice president at Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, where he led the company's domestic insurance businesses, and vice president and chief ethics and corporate compliance officer for Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company.
Winter spent more than 12 years on active duty with the United States Army and also practiced law for several years before joining the insurance industry. He earned his bachelor of science from the University of Michigan, his juris doctor from the Albany Law School of Union University and a master of laws from the University of Virginia School of Law. He is also a graduate of Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program.
Winter is currently on the board of Feeding America, the nation's leading hunger-relief charity, and he previously served on the boards of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the Houston Food Bank, and both the Connecticut and Houston Opera Companies.

Home / Attorneys / Robert P. Wilson Robert P. Wilson


Profile Summary
Mr. Robert P. Wilson is a senior attorney in the firm’s San Antonio office.
Mr. Wilson joined Thomas J. Henry in 2015 after representing clients in his own firm for over twenty years. He graduated from Baylor University with a BBA in 1985 and Baylor Law School in 1986. Since that time, Mr. Wilson has successfully represented clients in both state and federal courts in Central and South Texas. These trials have included successful recoveries for his clients in cases involving personal injuries, auto accidents, and wrongful death. In addition, he has maximized the recoveries for individuals and small businesses in business-related litigation including fraud, breach of contract, defamation, legal malpractice, civil rights, and sexual harassment.
Mr. Wilson believes that success comes through a deep understanding of his client’s concerns, extensive preparation, and tenacity.  In addition to his legal work, Mr. Wilson spends time traveling with his family to Africa where they engage in medical missions and orphan care in Liberia and Uganda.
