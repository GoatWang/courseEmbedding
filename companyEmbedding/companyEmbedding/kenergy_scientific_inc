      Except for the equity line of credit and the issuance of the secured
convertible debentures, the Company has no other significant sources of working
capital or cash commitments. In addition, management cannot be certain that it will generate
significant revenue from product sales. No assurance can be given that
SpeechSwitch will raise sufficient funds from such financing arrangements, or
that the Company will ever produce sufficient revenues to sustain its operations
or, that a market will develop for its common stock upon which a significant
amount of the Company's financing is dependant. If SpeechSwitch is unable to
recognize sufficient proceeds from these arrangements, however, management
believes that SpeechSwitch can limit its operations, defer payments to
management and maintain its business at nominal levels until it can identify
alternative sources of capital. In such event, assuming the receipt of the
minimum $500,000 proceeds from the equity line of credit, management believes
that SpeechSwitch could maintain its operations for 12 months.


A number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products
that compete with our products. Our competitors include IBM, Microsoft, Philips
Electronics, and ScanSoft. Our competitors may combine with each other, and
other companies may enter our markets by acquiring or entering into strategic 
relationships with our competitors. Current and potential competitors have established, or may
establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to
increase the abilities of their advanced speech and language technology products
to address the needs of our prospective customers.

      Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating
histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development and
marketing resources, greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we
do. Our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable
or superior to those we offer, adapt more quickly than we do to new
technologies, evolving industry trends and standards or customer requirements,
or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their
products than we do. Accordingly, we may not be able to compete effectively in
our markets and competition may intensify and future competition may harm our
business.

      We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market
include the breadth and depth of solutions, product quality and performance,
core technology, product scalability and reliability, product features, customer
service, the ability to implement solutions, the value of a given solution, the
creation of a base of referenceable customers and the strength and breadth of
reseller and channel relationships. Although we believe that our solutions
currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, particularly with
respect to product quality and performance, no assurance can be given that our
competitors will not develop new technologies or enhancements to their existing
products or introduce new products that will offer superior price or performance
features. We expect our competitors to offer new and existing products at prices
necessary to gain or retain market share. Certain of our competitors have
substantial financial resources, which may enable them to withstand sustained
price competition or a market downturn better than us. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to compete successfully in the pricing of our products, or
otherwise, in the future.


Company Description
SpeechSwitch, Inc., which we refer to in this prospectus as
"SpeechSwitch," "we", "us" or "the Company," was incorporated in New Jersey on
November 10, 2004 as a wholly owned subsidiary of iVoice Inc. ("iVoice"). While
iVoice has been engaged in the speech recognition software and


 computerized
telephony business since 1997, iVoice management seeks to leverage the value of
underutilized developed technology and believes that the transition to an
independent company will provide SpeechSwitch with greater access to capital.
This should provide needed financial resources to potentially penetrate the
market and distribute the product. As such, SpeechSwitch's business will be
formed from the contribution of certain assets and related liabilities on or
about the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus
is a part. In connection with a reorganization of iVoice, immediately prior to
the Distribution, iVoice will transfer to SpeechSwitch its lines of business
relating to its Speech-Enabled Auto Attendant, Name Dialer and Speech Software
Developers Kit (Speech SDK) products, which we refer to collectively in this
prospectus as its speech recognition software business, and related liabilities.
Following the Distribution, SpeechSwitch will own and operate iVoice's speech
recognition software business. Concurrently with the Distribution, iVoice
intends to contribute the majority of its remaining business lines into two
other new companies and intends to distribute the stock of those two companies
to its stockholders. Following the Distribution and the two other distributions,
iVoice's operating assets will consist of its iVoiceMail software and its
portfolio of patents and patent rights, and its future business development
operations will consist of licensing its intellectual property rights.
SpeechSwitch will be a development stage company following the Distribution.
SpeechSwitch intends to seek to expand its operations through additional sales
and marketing activity and the acquisition of additional businesses. These
potential acquired additional businesses may be outside the current field of
operations of SpeechSwitch. SpeechSwitch may not be able to identify,
successfully integrate or profitably manage any such businesses or operations.

      SpeechSwitch intends to continue to develop, market and license the speech
recognition line of computerized telephony software relating to the
Speech-Enabled Auto Attendant, Name Dialer and Speech SDK products. The
Speech-Enabled Auto Attendant is designed to engage callers in a natural
language dialog and transfer callers to an extension for the party the caller is
trying to reach at any time. Callers can interrupt the auto attendant at any
time by barging in on the prompts and simply saying the name of the person, or
department they wish to speak to. The Name Dialer product is an automatic phone
dialing system that imports contact information for dialing and, in response to
the saying by a user of a name included within the imported contact information,
places a call for such user to such person. Speech SDK is a tool for software
application developers which provides the ability to convert common command and
control functions to speech commands.

      Our principal office is located at 750 Highway 34, Matawan, New Jersey
07747. Our telephone number is (732) 441-7700.
