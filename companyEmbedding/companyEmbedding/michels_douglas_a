Drawing
        inspiration from the hair style trends of our favorite stars and
        celebrities has become a national pass time. One such star hair style is

Hollywood
 icon Michael
        Douglas.
        His always stylish hair and inherited movie star good looks is
        irresistible to women attracted to the  adventurous and romantic types.


TO
        GET THE LOOK:  Do you sometimes get a feeling your gray hair is
        making you look older then you feel?
Before you throw in the towel, take a hair styling lesson from Michael
        Douglas and watch what happens when you stroll into work looking �drop
        dead� handsome and ten years younger. If
        you up for a change, let�s take it one step at a time; starting
        with a style cut and shaping.


LET�S SHAPE
        IT: To
        jump start your new look, start with a
        layered contoured silhouette for a full look
        with mid-length sideburns and tapered neckline stylishly over the
        collar. The sides, crown and front are shaped for a full effect and fit the size of the
        head and balance the profile.  And with a few adjustments (tweaks) as it grows you can find the
        ideal length and shape for your style.
         
        



LET�S
        STYLE IT:
To style, start with a dab of a shaping
        gel, styling cream, gel mousse or nothing at all. Just run either
        through damp hair and comb in place to dry  au natural or give it a quick tousle with a
         blow dryer
        for a full look. If your locks look a bit dry or frizzy after using a
        blow dryer, a dab of  styling cream  will tame it. For a
        slick back textured
        effect, when dry, comb a puff of forming
        pomade through the top and sides and you�ve got the look!
         
        



LET�S
        ADD WHISKERS: Nothing
        can reshape a face or add a 
        dramatic look like facial hair. Whiskers when shaped can cover a
        ruddy complexion, add a stronger look to a pointed chin, cover a
        wide upper lip
        and give you an over-all artistic look. Sideburns can be full,
        close, long, 
 short or narrow. This simple addition can make large ears appear 
        smaller or a narrow face wider,  accent cheek bones and definitely
        adds 
        a stylish or artsy look. Include short mid length sideburns or
        whiskers 
        and
        you�re almost there.


NOW, LET�S COLOR IT:  Movie
        actors change their hair color often for the many roles they play and
        Michael Douglas is no exception. To put his graying hair stylishly 
        �under-cover�,  Michael�s is give a warm �sandy brown� hue with
        a semi-permanent tint. To keep gray away, the new growth is re-colored
        every 4 to 6 weeks. This extra step will cost a few bucks but what the
        hell, it�s a small price to pay for a youthful look and all the
        attention you get.


This
        new style and color puts you back in the game  looking drop dead handsome and ten years
        younger,  in a stylish grown up way. The contoured silhouette fits
        the shape of your head perfectly from all points of view.  You�ll love
        the ease of styling, this no fuss finger combed do� almost styles
        itself. The tapered sideburns and neckline stylishly over the collar add a
        
        �cool casual� look.
        The Sandy
brown hue has washed the years away and put your gray hair stylishly
        under-cover. Heads
        will turn and your pal�s will ask,  hey what�s up? When they see
        the ladies making a fuss over you with
        this new look. 

For
        Michael Douglas�s star style and color visit a salon
        stylist and make your style shine like the stars!
         
        

















Disclaimer:

Throughout my career

women and men of all ages have asked me to help them make their hair look like a star or

celebrity they admire. The styling techniques I recommend here are the steps I

would use at my Hollywood Hair Styling Studio to create a similar hairstyle. You may use

any hair care and styling product you wish to achieve a hair style that looks

like their style. It is

not my intention to mislead or make you think that the stars or celebrities

featured here either endorse or use my salon hair products to style their hair. 

If any star or celebrity has a problem with their (hair style)  being

featured on this site, please let us know and we will remove it.
